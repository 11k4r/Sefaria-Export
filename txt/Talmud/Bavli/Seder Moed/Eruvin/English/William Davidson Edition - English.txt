Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If an alleyway is enclosed on three sides with courtyards opening into it from three sides, and the fourth side opens into a public domain, it is prohibited by rabbinic law to carry objects in it on Shabbat. However, carrying in an alleyway under those circumstances is permitted if a cross beam is placed horizontally over the entrance to the alleyway. The mishna teaches that if the cross beam spans the entrance to <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway </span>at a <span class="gemarra-regular">height above twenty cubits, one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must diminish </span>the height of the cross beam so that it is less than twenty cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: He need not </span>diminish it, since the cross beam enables one to carry in the alleyway even at that height.
If the entrance to the alleyway is <span class="gemarra-regular">wider </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than ten cubits, one must diminish </span>its width. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if </span>the entrance to the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">has the form of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">doorway</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., two vertical posts on the two sides, and a horizontal beam spanning the space between them, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if it is wider than ten cubits, he need </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not diminish </span>it, as it is then regarded as an entrance, rather than a breach, even if it is very wide. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in tractate <span class="it-text">Sukka</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is more than twenty cubits </span><span class="gemarra-regular">high is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unfit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Yehuda deems it fit. </span>The <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> are similar in substance but differ in formulation, and accordingly the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the difference </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">unfit, whereas with regard to an alleyway, it teaches </span>the method of <span class="gemarra-regular">rectification, </span>that one must diminish the height of the cross beam?
The Gemara answers: With regard to <span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>since it is a mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law, </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">unfit, </span>as if it is not constructed in the proper manner, no mitzva is fulfilled. Whereas with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway, </span>where the entire prohibition of carrying is only <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic </span><span class="gemarra-regular">law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the method of <span class="gemarra-regular">rectification, </span>as the cross beam comes only to rectify a rabbinic prohibition, but does not involve a mitzva by Torah law. 
The Gemara suggests an alternative explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with regard to matters prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law, </span>it would have been appropriate for the mishna to teach a method of <span class="gemarra-regular">rectification. However, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, whose matters are numerous, it categorically teaches </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">unfit. </span>Merely diminishing the height of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> is insufficient to render it fit; it must also satisfy requirements governing its size, its walls, and its roofing. Teaching the remedy for each disqualification would have required lengthy elaboration. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">whose matters are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not numerous, </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the method of <span class="gemarra-regular">rectification. </span>Once the height is diminished, it is permitted to carry in the alleyway.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: The Rabbis only derived </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, that an opening more than twenty cubits high is not considered an entrance, <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the doorway of the Sanctuary, </span>the inner sanctum of the Temple. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda only derived </span>his opinion, that even an opening more than twenty cubits high is considered an entrance, <span class="gemarra-regular">from the doorway of the Entrance Hall </span>leading into the Sanctuary. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned</span> in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The doorway of the Sanctuary is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">twenty cubits high and ten cubits wide, and that of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Entrance Hall is forty cubits high and twenty cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wide</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara explains the basis of this tannaitic dispute. <span class="gemarra-regular">Both of them, </span>the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">interpreted the same verse homiletically: </span>“And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting, </span>and Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall sprinkle the blood on the altar round about” (Leviticus 3:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">As the Rabbis hold</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the sanctity of the Sanctuary is discrete and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sanctity of the Entrance Hall is discrete, </span>i.e., the Sanctuary and the Entrance Hall have distinct levels of sanctity. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>since the essence of the Temple is the Sanctuary and not the Entrance Hall, and since the Sanctuary in the Temple parallels the Tent of Meeting in the Tabernacle, <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">speaks of the doorway of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Tent of Meeting, it is referring to </span>the doorway of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sanctuary. </span>Therefore, the term doorway applies to an opening similar to the doorway of the Sanctuary, which is twenty cubits high. There is no source indicating that an opening with larger dimensions is also considered a doorway.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sanctuary </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the Entrance Hall are one, </span>equal, <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctity, and </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">when it is written: “The doorway of the Tent of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meeting,” it is referring to both of them, </span>and accordingly, the term doorway applies to a larger entrance as well. 
The Gemara suggests an alternative understanding of the dispute. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">even according to Rabbi Yehuda, the sanctity of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Sanctuary is discrete and the sanctity of the Entrance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Hall is discrete. And here, this is the reasoning of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda: </span>By fusing together language from different verses, the result is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: To the doorway of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Entrance Hall of the House</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, even the doorway of the Entrance Hall is referred to in the Torah as a doorway, and the same is true of any opening with comparable dimensions. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis </span>say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Had </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">written: “To the doorway of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Entrance Hall,” </span>it would be interpreted <span class="gemarra-regular">as you said. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">now that it is written: “To the doorway of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Entrance Hall of the House,” </span>it is to be understood: To the doorway of <span class="gemarra-regular">the House that opens into the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Entrance Hall, </span>i.e., the Sanctuary, and consequently, the definition of doorway is derived from the dimensions of the doorway of the Sanctuary. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty with the very basis of this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But when this is written: </span>“The doorway of the Tent of Meeting,” <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it written with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to the Tabernacle </span>in the wilderness? How can the status in the permanent Sanctuary, i.e., the Temple in Jerusalem, be derived from matters stated with regard to the Tabernacle?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">We find that the Tabernacle is called Temple, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and that the Temple is called Tabernacle; </span>therefore, the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> that govern one can be derived from the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if you do not say so, </span>that the Tabernacle and the Temple are one with regard to their <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: Peace-offerings that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were slaughtered </span>in the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">prior to the opening of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the doors of the Sanctuar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> in the morning <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified </span>would be difficult. That <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is stated: “And he shall slaughter it at the doorway [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">petaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of the Tent of Meeting,” </span>from which it is derived: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the doors to the Tent of Meeting <span class="gemarra-regular">are open [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">petuḥin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], and not when they are closed. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But when this is written: </span>The doorway of the Tent of Meeting, <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it written with regard to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Tabernacle? Rather, </span>for halakhic purposes, <span class="gemarra-regular">we find the Temple called </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Tabernacle, and the Tabernacle called Temple.</span>
The Gemara questions its previous conclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, the Temple is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">called Tabernacle, as it is written: “And I will set </span><span class="gemarra-regular">My Tabernacle among you” </span>(Leviticus 26:11), and the reference is to the permanent Sanctuary, i.e., the Temple, as the verse is referring to that which will transpire after the Jewish people settle in their land. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Tabernacle is called Temple, from where do we </span>derive it? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that it is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from that which is written: “And the Kehatites, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the bearers of the Temple, set forward, that they may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">set up the Tabernacle before they came” </span>(Numbers 10:21), 

Daf 2b

<span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>instance of the term Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>not written with regard to the Tabernacle; rather, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">written with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the ark </span>and the other sacred objects in the Tabernacle, as the sons of Kehat carried only the sacred vessels and not the Tabernacle itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: “And let them make Me a Temple that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I may dwell among them” </span>(Exodus 25:8), where the reference is to the Tabernacle.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis and according to</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, let them derive </span>the maximum width of a doorway <span class="gemarra-regular">from the doorway of the gate</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the courtyard </span>of the Tabernacle. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “The length of the courtyard shall be one hundred cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the breadth fifty everywhere, and the height five cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Exodus 27:18). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written: “The hangings on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits; </span>their pillars three and their sockets three” (Exodus 27:14). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written: “And for the other side of the court </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gate, on this hand and on that hand, were hangings </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of fifteen cubits; </span>their pillars three and their sockets three” (Exodus 38:15). If the hangings on both sides of the gate covered thirty of the courtyard’s total width of fifty cubits, apparently, the gate of the courtyard was twenty cubits wide and five cubits high. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>with regard to the Tabernacle, an entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>cubits high <span class="gemarra-regular">by twenty </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">wide </span>is considered a doorway, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span><span class="gemarra-regular">too here, </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, an entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>cubits high <span class="gemarra-regular">by twenty </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">wide </span>should be considered a doorway.
The Gemara rejects this assertion: There is no proof from there, as that entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">is called the doorway</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the gate of the courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not called a doorway, unmodified. </span>Consequently, the dimensions of a doorway mentioned without qualification cannot be derived from that doorway. 
The Gemara offers an alternative answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if you wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">when it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “The hangings on one side of the gate shall be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fifteen cubits,” </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the height </span>of the hangings. The width of the hangings, however, is not specified in the Torah at all, and therefore the width of the doorway of the gate of the courtyard is unknown. 
The Gemara raises an objection: Could it be that the <span class="gemarra-regular">height </span>of the hangings was fifteen cubits? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t it written </span>explicitly in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">height five cubits”? </span>The Gemara answers: The verse is stating that the height of the hangings was five cubits, measured <span class="gemarra-regular">from the edge of the altar and above. </span>The altar itself was ten cubits high, while the hangings of the courtyard were fifteen cubits high, five cubits higher than the altar. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did Rabbi Yehuda </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">from the doorway</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Entrance Hall? But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna that if the entrance to an alleyway is <span class="gemarra-regular">wider than ten cubits, one must diminish </span>its width? <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda does not dispute </span>this ruling. Wasn’t the doorway of the Entrance Hall wider than ten cubits?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>In fact, Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees </span>with the unattributed opinion of the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. As it was taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If the entrance to an alleyway is <span class="gemarra-regular">wider than ten cubits, he must diminish </span>its width; <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: He need not diminish it. </span>
The Gemara asks further: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him disagree in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the mishna. </span>Why is Rabbi Yehuda’s dispute cited only in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, and not in the mishna? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees </span>in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>an entrance’s <span class="gemarra-regular">height, but the same applies to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its width. </span>His statement: He need not reduce it, is referring both to the entrance’s height and to its width.
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> still, </span>is it possible that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda derived </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">from the doorway of the Entrance Hall? Wasn’t it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to a cross beam spanning the entrance to <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway that is higher than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> twenty cubits, one must diminish </span>its height; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda deems it fit up to forty and fifty cubits.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>in a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">bar Kappara taught </span>the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda: It is fit <span class="gemarra-regular">up to a hundred</span> cubits. 
The Gemara clarifies its question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to bar Kappara, </span>the phrase: Up to a hundred, can be understood as <span class="gemarra-regular">an exaggeration</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> not as an exact number. All that Rabbi Yehuda meant to say is that it is permitted to carry in the alleyway even if the cross beam is significantly higher than twenty cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda </span>in the name of Rav, <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exaggeration </span>is there? He certainly meant precisely what he said. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">forty </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda derived </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the doorway of the Entrance Hall. However, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where does he derive </span>it? Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda did not derive the dimensions of an entrance from the doorway of the Entrance Hall. He derived them from a different source.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">misled Rav </span>and led him to explain that Rabbi Yehuda derived the measurements of an entrance from the doorway of the Entrance Hall. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to a cross beam spanning the entrance to <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway that is higher than twenty</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits, higher than the doorway of the Sanctuary, one must</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> diminish </span>its height. Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains: From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis derived </span>the dimensions of an entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">from the doorway</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Sanctuary, Rabbi Yehuda </span>must have <span class="gemarra-regular">derived </span>those dimensions <span class="gemarra-regular">from the doorway of the Entrance Hall. But that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not so. </span>Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda derived </span>the dimensions of an entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">from the entrance of kings</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whose regular practice was to erect their entrances exceedingly high and wide.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And, </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, if they derived </span>their opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">from the doorway of the Sanctuary, let them require </span><span class="gemarra-regular">doors </span>in order to render an alleyway fit for one to carry within it, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>there were doors in <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sanctuary. Why </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">did we learn </span>in the mishna: With regard to the method of <span class="gemarra-regular">rendering an alleyway fit </span>for carrying within it, <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: </span>Both <span class="gemarra-regular">a side </span><span class="gemarra-regular">post </span>placed adjacent to one of the sides of the alleyway’s entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>over the entrance to the alleyway are required. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: </span>Either <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post or a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>is sufficient. However, not even according to the more stringent opinion of Beit Shammai are doors required.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sanctuary doors were made solely for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">privacy, </span>but served no practical function. The doorway of the Sanctuary did not require doors to be considered an entrance. It was a full-fledged entrance even without them. 
The Gemara raises another question: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if so, </span>that the Rabbis derive their opinion from the entrance to the Sanctuary, <span class="gemarra-regular">the form of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a doorway, </span>i.e., two vertical posts on the two sides, with a horizontal cross beam spanning the space between them, <span class="gemarra-regular">should not be effective </span>if the alleyway is more than ten cubits wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the Sanctuary had the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">form of a doorway, and even so, it was </span>no more than <span class="gemarra-regular">ten cubits wide. Why </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">did we learn </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">has the form of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a doorway, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even if it is wider than ten </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits, he need not diminish </span>its width?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As that is the reason only according to Rav, </span>who holds that the Rabbis derive their opinion from the doorway of the Sanctuary. <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rav Yehuda teach </span>this mishna to <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥiyya bar Rav before Rav, </span>saying that if the entrance had the form of a doorway <span class="gemarra-regular">he need not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> diminish it, and Rav said to him </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>a different version: <span class="gemarra-regular">He must diminish it. </span>Apparently, according to Rav himself, the form of a doorway does not render it permitted to carry within the alleyway if its entrance is wider than the doorway of the Sanctuary, and therefore the question about the form of a doorway poses no difficulty to his opinion. 
The Gemara raises an additional difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">so, </span>

Daf 3a

<span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>molded or protruding <span class="gemarra-regular">cornice [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">amaltera</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> crowning the entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">should not be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">effective </span>in rendering an alleyway fit to carry within it if it is higher than twenty cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the Sanctuary </span><span class="gemarra-regular">had a cornice, and even so </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty cubits </span><span class="gemarra-regular">high, </span>and no more. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Over it were five oak cornices</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>protruding <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara attempts to dismiss this difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the refutation? Perhaps</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when that </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to cornices was taught, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught with regard to the Entrance Hall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whose height was forty cubits, and not with regard to the Sanctuary.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the difficulty </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Perhaps the design of the Sanctuary was like the design</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Entrance Hall. </span>Just as there were cornices in one doorway, there were cornices in the other.
The Gemara returns to its question with regard to a cornice: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">did Rabbi Ile’a say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>If the <span class="gemarra-regular">width </span>of a cross beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if it is not sturdy, </span>it renders the alleyway fit for carrying within it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if it has a cornice, even if it is higher </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than twenty cubits, one need not diminish </span>its height. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosef said: </span>This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to a <span class="gemarra-regular">cornice </span>was not actually stated by Rav, but rather it <span class="gemarra-regular">is a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Who, </span>in fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? Perhaps it is not an authoritative <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, and Rav does not have to accept what it says.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Isn’t it Ḥama, son of Rabba bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Avuh, who teaches it? And </span>therefore, even if the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to a <span class="gemarra-regular">cornice will be a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it</span> nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">poses a difficulty to Rav.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you: </span>Even if you <span class="gemarra-regular">eliminate me </span>and my explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the discussion <span class="gemarra-regular">here, don’t the </span>two <span class="gemarra-italic">baraitot</span> themselves, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that states that the Rabbis derive the dimensions of an entrance from the doorway of the Sanctuary and the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that states that in the case of a cornice, even if it is higher than twenty cubits, it need not be lowered, <span class="gemarra-regular">contradict each other? Rather, what have you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to say </span>to reconcile the contradiction? The matter is the subject of a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; so too, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to my </span>opinion, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the subject of a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Without Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraitot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do not contradict each other, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">according to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Rabbis, what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam</span> renders an alleyway fit for carrying? Because it serves <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a conspicuous marker </span>between the alleyway and the public domain. Ordinarily a cross beam more than twenty cubits high is not noticeable; however, a cornice attracts attention even at that height. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that which is taught </span>in the other <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the height of a beam at the entrance to an alleyway: <span class="gemarra-regular">Greater than the entrance of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sanctuary, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">merely </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">mnemonic </span>device. No actual <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> are derived from the entrance of the Sanctuary.
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>that the explanation of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak works out well if he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not hold this </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba; however, if he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">holds this </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba, </span>it is difficult. As <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>with regard to the fitness of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> whose roofing is higher than twenty cubits that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">In order that your generations should know that I made </span>the children of Israel <span class="gemarra-regular">dwell in booths </span>when I brought them out of the land of Egypt; I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 23:43). When the roofing of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">up to twenty cubits </span>high, <span class="gemarra-regular">a person is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">aware that he is dwelling in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>however, when the roofing of the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">above twenty cubits, a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person is not aware </span>that he is dwelling in a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">because the eye does not discern </span>the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> roofing. One does not usually raise his head to look that high, and consequently, he sees the walls and does not notice the defining feature of the <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, its roofing.
The Gemara explains the difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as well, </span>the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree </span>whether or not an item more than twenty cubits high is <span class="gemarra-regular">conspicuous. </span>According to Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need them to <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree</span> about the same point <span class="gemarra-regular">in two cases, </span>that of <span class="it-text">sukka</span> and that of an alleyway? That the dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda with regard to <span class="it-text">sukka</span> revolves around this issue indicates that their dispute with regard to an alleyway revolves around a different point, as asserted by Rav. 
The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach both disputes, <span class="gemarra-regular">as had </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one might have thought that only <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>case does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda say </span>that an object is conspicuous even above twenty cubits; <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is designed for </span>extended <span class="gemarra-regular">dwelling, the eye </span>undoubtedly <span class="gemarra-regular">discerns </span>the roofing at some point. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway, </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">is designed for walking, say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">concedes to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis </span>that a person walking in an alleyway does not notice objects at so significant a height. <span class="gemarra-regular">And had </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case of an alleyway, one might have thought that only <span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span>case do <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis say </span>that people do not notice objects at so significant a height; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span>case of <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they concede to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehuda, </span>for the above-stated reason. Therefore, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach both disputes.
The Gemara seeks to arrive at a precise definition of <span class="it-text">amaltera</span>, translated above as cornice. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">amaltera</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ḥama</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, son of Rabba bar Avuh, said: </span>It refers to decorative wood carvings in the shape of <span class="gemarra-regular">birds’ nests. When </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they say in the West</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Eretz Yisrael, it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">cedar poles</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who said </span>that <span class="it-text">amaltera</span> refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">cedar poles </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>permit use of carvings of <span class="gemarra-regular">birds’ nests, </span>as a cross beam engraved with images attracts attention and is noticeable even at a great height. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who said </span>that <span class="it-text">amaltera</span> refers to carvings of <span class="gemarra-regular">birds’ nests </span>would say that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to a cornice applies only to them, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not to cedar poles.</span>
The Gemara clarifies the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who said cedar poles</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. What is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>for his opinion? He holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">since its length is great, </span>a cedar pole attracts attention. <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t the length of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> great </span>as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis say that </span>a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> higher than twenty cubits is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>fit?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the reason is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>a cedar pole <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">significant </span>value, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>generates <span class="gemarra-regular">publicity. </span>People passing through an alleyway stop and stare at a cross beam of that kind, even when it is higher than twenty cubits, leading others publicity to do so as well.
The Gemara raises a question: If <span class="gemarra-regular">part of the</span> cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>of an alleyway is <span class="gemarra-regular">within twenty </span>cubits of the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">and part of the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">above</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> twenty </span>cubits, and similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">part of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">roofing </span>of a <span class="it-text">sukk</span><span class="it-text">a</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">within twenty </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">and part</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the roofing </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">above twenty </span>cubits, what is its legal status? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: In </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> alleyway, it is fit; in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is unfit.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway</span> that the ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is fit? </span>It is because <span class="gemarra-regular">we say: Thin </span>the part of the cross beam that is beyond twenty cubits, i.e., consider it as if it were not there. If so, in the case of <span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> too, say: Thin </span>the roofing that is beyond twenty cubits.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you thin </span>the roofing beyond twenty cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">it will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> result in </span>a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">whose sun is more than its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shade. </span>Were the section of the roofing above twenty cubits removed, the roofing that remained would not provide sufficient shade for the <span class="it-text">sukka</span>. 
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>in the case of a cross beam, <span class="gemarra-regular">if you thin </span>the section above twenty cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">it would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> become a </span>weak and unstable cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam that is removed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by the wind, </span>which does not render the alleyway fit for carrying within it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, perforce, </span>the status of the remaining parts of those cross beams <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">metal skewers [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shefudin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which, although they are thin, are not removed by the wind. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>in the case of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">perforce, </span>even after the upper roofing is removed, the status of the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes like </span>that of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">whose shade is more than its sun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara explains Rabba’s distinction differently. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava from Parzakya said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, which is </span>generally erected <span class="gemarra-regular">for an individual, </span>if the portion of the roofing below twenty were removed and only the portion above twenty remained, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">not be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reminded </span>to lower the remaining roofing and would dwell in a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> that is unfit. <span class="gemarra-regular">An alleyway, </span>in contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>used by <span class="gemarra-regular">many </span>people, if the section of the cross beam below twenty cubits were removed, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">remind</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> each other </span>to remedy the situation. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said </span>a different explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">With </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>since its mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">is by Torah </span><span class="gemarra-regular">law, the Sages were stringent. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway, </span>since the entire requirement to place a cross beam across the entrance in order to permit carrying in an alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law, the Sages were not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stringent.</span>
The Gemara cites a different version of Rabba’s distinction: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Mattana taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabba </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite </span>manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: In </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway, it is unfit; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is fit. </span>As a result, all the previous explanations must be reversed.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is different in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is fit? </span>Because <span class="gemarra-regular">we say: Thin </span>the roofing that is beyond twenty cubits. If so, then <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam as well, let us say: Thin </span>the part of the cross beam that is beyond twenty cubits.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you thin </span>the part beyond twenty cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will become a </span>weak and unstable cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam that moves </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the wind. </span>The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>in the case of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">if you thin </span>the upper section of the roofing, <span class="gemarra-regular">it would become </span>a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">whose sun is more than its shade. Rather, perforce, </span>even after the upper roofing is removed, the status of the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes like </span>that of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">whose shade </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is more than its sun; here too, </span>in the case of an alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">perforce, </span>the status of the remaining parts of those cross beams <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">metal skewers, </span>which, although they are thin, do not move in the wind.
The Gemara offers a different explanation of Rabba’s distinction: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from Parzakya said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which is </span>generally erected <span class="gemarra-regular">for an individual, he casts </span>responsibility <span class="gemarra-regular">upon himself and is reminded </span>to make certain that the roofing is fit. In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway, which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>used by <span class="gemarra-regular">many </span>people, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>are likely to <span class="gemarra-regular">rely </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upon each other and are not reminded </span>to check the height of the cross beam. <span class="gemarra-regular">As people say: A pot</span> belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">partners is neither hot nor cold. </span>When responsibility falls upon more than one person, each relies on the other, and ultimately the task is not completed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina </span>offered a different explanation and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The mitzva of <span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">is by Torah law, does not require reinforcement </span>by the Sages, and consequently, they were lenient in that case. However, since the entire requirement to place a cross beam across the entrance to <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway is by rabbinic </span><span class="gemarra-regular">law, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">requires reinforcement, </span>and therefore the Sages were stringent.
Since there are two contradictory versions of Rabba’s statement, the Gemara inquires: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>practical conclusion <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>reached <span class="gemarra-regular">about this </span>problem, if part of the roofing of the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> or the cross beam was above twenty cubits? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Ulla said: </span>In that case, both <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>an alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that, </span>a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">are unfit. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>Both <span class="gemarra-regular">this and that are fit, </span>

Daf 3b

as that which <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the mishna, with regard to the unfitness of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> higher than twenty cubits, is referring to the interior <span class="gemarra-regular">space of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>and that which <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the mishna, that a cross beam spanning an alleyway that is more than twenty cubits must be lowered, is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">space </span>at the entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">of the alleyway </span>beneath the cross beam. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught that supports your </span>opinion: If the cross beam spanning the entrance of <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">higher than twenty cubits </span>off the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> entrance of the Sanctuary, one must diminish its </span>height. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the space of the </span>entrance of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Sanctuary itself was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> twenty </span>cubits high, and its roof was higher than twenty cubits. Apparently, the twenty cubits mentioned with regard to a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> and an alleyway refers to the space beneath the roofing and the cross beam.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shimi bar Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ashi raised an objection to Rav Pappa </span>from the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">would he do it? He places the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam from the edge of twenty </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">and below</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Apparently, the entire cross beam must be within twenty cubits of the ground, and if any part of it rises above twenty it is unfit.
Rav Pappa replied: Emend the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>From the edge of twenty cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">and above. </span>Rav Shimi retorted: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">below? </span>What justification is there to completely reverse the meaning of the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>?  
Rava explained that there is no need to emend the language of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, but merely to reinterpret it. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us the following: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">below is like </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">above. Just as above, </span>with regard to the maximum height of the cross beam, it is the <span class="gemarra-regular">space </span>beneath the cross beam that may not be more than <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">below, </span>with regard to the minimum height of the cross beam, it is the <span class="gemarra-regular">space </span>beneath the cross beam that may not be less than <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths. However, a cross beam placed within ten handbreadths of the ground is unfit and does not render it permitted to carry within the alleyway. 
The Gemara considers the measure of the cubit mentioned in the mishna and elsewhere. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the name of Rav Naḥman: The cubit </span>mentioned with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the cubit </span>mentioned in connection with the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of an alleyway </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>small <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit </span>consisting <span class="gemarra-regular">of five </span>handbreadths. In contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">the cubit of</span> a forbidden mixture of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds </span>of seeds is <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> large <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit </span>consisting <span class="gemarra-regular">of six </span>handbreadths. Apparently, Rav Naḥman rules stringently in all cases. 
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">The cubit of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway is a cubit </span>consisting <span class="gemarra-regular">of five </span>handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">With </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> does this ruling apply? It applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the issue of the height of the cross beam spanning an alleyway that may not be more than twenty cubits high, <span class="gemarra-regular">and to the breach of an alleyway </span>that may not be more than ten cubits wide. 
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t there </span>also the issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>minimal <span class="gemarra-regular">length </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of an alleyway? </span>For carrying in an alleyway to be rendered permissible by means of a side post or a cross beam, it must be at least <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>long. In that case, measuring the alleyway with small cubits will lead <span class="gemarra-regular">to a leniency.</span>
The Gemara resolves this difficulty: Rav Naḥman holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with the one who said </span>that the length of an alleyway need only be <span class="gemarra-regular">four handbreadths. </span>However, a cubit mentioned in the context of an alleyway is always a small cubit, which is a stringency. 
The Gemara proposes an alternative solution: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that actually Rav Naḥman holds in accordance with the opinion that the length of an alleyway must be <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits, </span>and in that case, the alleyway is measured with large cubits of six handbreadths as a stringency. When he is saying that the cubit of an alleyway is a cubit of five handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is speaking of most, </span>but not all, <span class="gemarra-regular">cubits </span>mentioned in the context of an alleyway.
Rav Naḥman said that <span class="gemarra-regular">the cubit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>small <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit </span>consisting <span class="gemarra-regular">of five</span> handbreadths. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> does this ruling apply? It applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing <span class="gemarra-regular">its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> height, </span>i.e., that a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> may not be more than twenty cubits high, <span class="gemarra-regular">and to the </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> curved wall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> A <span class="it-text">sukka</span> is considered valid if there are up to four cubits of invalid roofing, provided that this roofing is adjacent to one of the walls of the <span class="it-text">sukka</span>. In that case, the invalid roofing is considered an extension of the wall, i.e., the wall is considered to be curved, and consequently, the entire <span class="it-text">sukka</span> is valid. With regard to both <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>, the ruling is stringent and distance is measured with small cubits.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t there</span> also the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>minimal <span class="gemarra-regular">length of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which must be at least <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>long? If it is measured with small cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>will lead <span class="gemarra-regular">to a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> leniency. As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I say, any </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that does not </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">in it </span>an area of at least <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by four cubits is invalid.</span>
The Gemara resolves this difficulty: Rav Naḥman holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, who say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>A <span class="it-text">sukka</span> is valid <span class="gemarra-regular">even if it holds only one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s head, most of his </span>body, <span class="gemarra-regular">and his table.</span>
The Gemara suggests another solution: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>Rav Naḥman’s statement holds true even if <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi that a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> must be at least four cubits long. Indeed, the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> is measured with large cubits consisting of six handbreadths, which is a stringency. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>when he says that the cubit of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> is a cubit of five handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is speaking of most, </span>but not all, <span class="gemarra-regular">cubits </span>mentioned with regard to <span class="it-text">sukka</span>. 
The Gemara continues: As stated above, Rav Naḥman said that <span class="gemarra-regular">the cubit of a </span>forbidden mixture of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds </span>of seeds <span class="gemarra-regular">is a cubit </span>consisting <span class="gemarra-regular">of six handbreadths. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> does this ruling apply? It applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a clearing in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vineyard and to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">the perimeter of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vineyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Kilayim</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a clearing in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vineyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Beit Shammai say: </span>Its measure is <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-four </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits, and Beit Hillel say: Sixteen cubits. </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the perimeter of a vineyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Beit Shammai say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sixteen cubits, and Beit Hillel say: Twelve cubits.</span>
The mishna explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clearing in a vineyard? </span>It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a vineyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whose middle </span>section <span class="gemarra-regular">was laid bare </span>of vines. If <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not sixteen cubits </span>across in the clearing, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not bring </span>foreign <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds </span>and sow them <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>due to the Torah prohibition against sowing other crops in a vineyard (Deuteronomy 22:9). If <span class="gemarra-regular">there were sixteen cubits </span>across in the clearing, <span class="gemarra-regular">one provides </span>the vineyard with <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>requisite <span class="gemarra-regular">work area</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., four cubits along either side of the vines are left unsown to facilitate cultivation of the vines, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he sows the rest </span>of the cleared area with foreign crops.
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the perimeter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a vineyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> It is the vacant area <span class="gemarra-regular">between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the vineyard and the fence </span>surrounding it. If <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are not twelve cubits </span>in that area, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bring </span>foreign <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds </span>and sow them <span class="gemarra-regular">there. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">there were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">twelve cubits </span>in that area, <span class="gemarra-regular">he provides </span>the vineyard, with <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>requisite <span class="gemarra-regular">work area, </span>four cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he sows the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rest.</span>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t there </span>also the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of vines that planted <span class="gemarra-regular">consecutively, within four cubits </span>of each other, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>measuring the distance with large cubits would lead <span class="gemarra-regular">to a leniency? As we learned </span>in a mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a vineyard that was planted </span>in consecutive rows <span class="gemarra-regular">with less than four cubits </span>between them, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>Since the rows are planted so closely together, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a vineyard, </span>and if one plants other crops there he is not liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis say: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a vineyard, and one regards the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">middle </span>vines, those planted between two appropriately spaced rows, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if they are not </span>there. One who plants other crops there is indeed liable. According to Rabbi Shimon’s opinion, measuring the distance between the rows with large cubits leads to leniency.
The Gemara resolves the difficulty: Rav Naḥman made his statement <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, who say </span>that a densely planted vineyard <span class="gemarra-regular">is a vineyard. And if you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>Rav Naḥman’s statement holds true even if <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>that a densely planted vineyard is not a vineyard, and the distance between the rows is measured with small cubits consisting of five handbreadths as a stringency. When he says that the cubit of diverse kinds of seeds is a cubit consisting of six handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is speaking</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of most, </span>but not all, <span class="gemarra-regular">cubits </span>mentioned with regard to a forbidden mixture of diverse kinds of seeds.
The above was based on the ruling of Rav Naḥman according to Abaye. <span class="gemarra-regular">But Rava said in the name</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav Naḥman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> All cubits </span>mentioned in measurements by the Sages consisted of a large <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit of six </span>handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, these, </span>the cubits mentioned with regard to diverse kinds of seeds, <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>measured with <span class="gemarra-regular">expansive </span>handbreadths, with the fingers spread apart, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas those, </span>the cubits mentioned with regard to an alleyway and a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>measured with <span class="gemarra-regular">compressed</span> handbreadths, with the fingers held together.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Gemara raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">All cubits that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were mentioned by the Sages are cubits of six </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided</span>

Daf 4a

<span class="gemarra-regular">that they are not precisely </span>a cubit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to Rava, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> means: <span class="gemarra-regular">So </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that these, </span>the cubits of diverse kinds of seeds, <span class="gemarra-regular">should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be </span>measured with <span class="gemarra-regular">expansive </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">and those, </span>the cubits of <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, should be measured with <span class="gemarra-regular">depressed </span>handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to Abaye, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: </span>Emend the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">say: The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubit of diverse kinds </span>of seeds mentioned by the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>measured <span class="gemarra-regular">with a cubit of six </span>handbreadths, not the other cubits.
The Gemara raises a difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon ben Gamliel says: All the cubits that the Sages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mentioned with regard to diverse kinds </span>of seeds are measured <span class="gemarra-regular">with cubits of six </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that they are not</span> measured with <span class="gemarra-regular">exact </span>handbreadths? This proves <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span> anonymous <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is speaking of all cubits, </span>and not only those in the case of diverse kinds of seeds.
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: Isn’t there Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who holds in accordance with my </span>opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">I stated </span>my opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Gamliel.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Abaye, </span>the issue of large and small cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">is certainly </span>subject to a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as his ruling can only be in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. <span class="gemarra-regular">According </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Rava, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">must it be said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>subject to a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
The Gemara answers: This is not necessarily the case, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to you: Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel </span>does not dispute the basic teaching of the anonymous first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> that all the cubits mentioned by the Sages are cubits of six handbreadths. Rather, he <span class="gemarra-regular">came to teach us this: One </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">not reduce the cubit of diverse kinds </span>of seeds, i.e., one should not measure it with depressed handbreadths.
The Gemara raises an objection. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> if that is the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him say: One must</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not reduce the cubit of diverse kinds </span>of seeds. <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does </span>the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">A cubit </span>consisting <span class="gemarra-regular">of six </span>handbreadths come <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude? Does it not </span>come <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubit of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the cubit of an alleyway, </span>which are measured with cubits of five handbreadths?
The Gemara rejects this argument. <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s formulation comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude the cubit of the base </span>of the altar, which is the bottom level of the altar, one cubit high with a ledge one cubit wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubit of the surrounding ledg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the altar, which is five cubits above the base, six cubits above the ground, and one cubit wide. Everyone agrees that those cubits are small cubits of five handbreadths.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “And these are the measures </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the alta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by cubits; the cubit is a cubit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a handbreadth, the bottom shall be a cubit, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the breadth a cubit, and its border by its edge</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> round about shall be a span: And this shall be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the higher part of the altar” </span>(Ezekiel 43:13). And the Sages explained this verse as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The bottom shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be a cubit,” this is the base </span>of the altar; <span class="gemarra-regular">“and the breadth a cubit,” this is the surrounding </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ledge </span>of the altar; <span class="gemarra-regular">“and its border by its edge</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> round about,” these are the horns </span>of the altar, i.e., extensions of the corners of the altar; <span class="gemarra-regular">“and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this shall be the higher part of the altar,” </span>this refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">the golden altar </span>that stood inside the Sanctuary and was also measured by small cubits.
Since the Gemara discussed measurements, it proceeds to cite that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ashi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: The measures </span>relating to mitzvot in the Torah, and the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> governing <span class="gemarra-regular">interpositions </span>that invalidate ritual immersions, and the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>all <span class="gemarra-italic">halakhot</span> transmitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to Moses from Sinai. </span>These <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> have no basis in the Written Torah, but according to tradition they were orally transmitted by God to Moses together with the Written Torah.
The Gemara questions this assertion: Are <span class="gemarra-regular">measure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> transmitted to Moses from Sinai? <span class="gemarra-regular">They are </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is written: “A land of wheat, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and barley, </span>and vines, and figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey” (Deuteronomy 8:8), <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rav Ḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: This entire verse was stated for </span>the purpose of teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">measures </span>with regard to different <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> in the Torah. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Wheat </span>was mentioned as the basis for calculating the time required for one to become ritually impure when entering a house afflicted with leprosy, <span class="gemarra-regular">as that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who enters </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a house afflicted with lepros</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> of the house (see Leviticus 14), <span class="gemarra-regular">and his clothes </span>are draped <span class="gemarra-regular">over his shoulders, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and his sandals and his rings are in his hands, </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">he and they, </span>the clothes, sandals, and rings, <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately</span> become <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure. </span>However, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he was dressed in his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clothes, and his sandals were on his feet, and his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rings were on his fingers, he immediately </span>becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but they, </span>the clothes, sandals, and rings, <span class="gemarra-regular">remain pure until</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he stays </span>in the house <span class="gemarra-regular">long enough to eat half</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a loaf </span>of bread. This calculation is based on <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bread, </span>which takes less time to eat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">barley bread, </span>and it relates to one who is <span class="gemarra-regular">reclining</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and eating </span>it together <span class="gemarra-regular">with relish, </span>which hastens the eating. This is a Torah measurement connected specifically to wheat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Barley </span>is also used as a basis for measurements, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">A bone </span>from a corpse the size <span class="gemarra-regular">of a </span>grain of <span class="gemarra-regular">barle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> imparts </span>ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity through contact and by being carried, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">it does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not impart impurity </span>by means <span class="gemarra-regular">of a tent, </span>i.e., if the bone was inside a house, it does not render all the articles in the house ritually impure. 
The halakhic measure determined by a <span class="gemarra-regular">vine is the quantity of a quarter-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of wine for a nazirite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> A nazirite, who is prohibited to drink wine, is liable to be flogged if he drinks that measure. 

Daf 4b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Fig </span>alludes to the measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">a dried fig-bulk</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying out </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> One is liable for carrying food fit for human consumption on Shabbat,  provided that he carries a dried fig-bulk of that food.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Pomegranate </span>teaches the measure, <span class="gemarra-regular">as that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">All </span>ritually impure wooden <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels belonging to </span>ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">homeowner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> become pure through being broken, as broken vessels cannot contract or maintain ritual impurity, and they are considered broken if they have holes <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> size of pomegranates.</span>
The Sages interpreted: <span class="gemarra-regular">A land of olive oil and honey, </span>as: <span class="gemarra-regular">A land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, all of whose measures are olive-bulks. </span>The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does it enter your mind </span>that it is a land <span class="gemarra-regular">all of whose measures </span>are olives-bulks? <span class="gemarra-regular">Yet aren’t there those </span>measures <span class="gemarra-regular">that we </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">mentioned </span>above, which are not olive-bulks? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say: A land, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">most of whose measures are olive-bulks, </span>as most measures, e.g., those relating to forbidden foods and to impurity imparted by a corpse in a tent and by contact with an animal carcass, are olive-bulks.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Honey, </span>i.e., dates from which date honey is extracted, also determines a measure, as with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>eating on <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one is liable only if he eats <span class="gemarra-regular">a large date</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-bul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> of food. Clearly, the measurements pertaining to mitzvot are explicitly written in the Torah and were not transmitted to Moses from Sinai. 
The Gemara refutes this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">And can you hold </span>that all these <span class="gemarra-regular">measures are </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>in the Torah with regard to each of the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> mentioned above? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakhot</span> that were transmitted to Moses from Sinai, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Sages based them on verses </span>in the Torah.
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ashi said above that Rav said that the laws governing <span class="gemarra-regular">interpositions </span>that invalidate ritual immersion are <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> transmitted to Moses from Sinai. The Gemara challenges this assertion: These, too, <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah, as it is written: “And he shall bathe </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all his flesh in the water” </span>(Leviticus 15:16), and the Sages derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that nothing should intervene between his flesh and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The definite article in the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the water” </span>indicates that this bathing is performed in water mentioned elsewhere, i.e., specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">in the water of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a ritual bath, </span>and not in just any water. And the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“all his flesh” </span>indicates that it must be in <span class="gemarra-regular">water into which all of his body can</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enter, </span>i.e., in which a person can immerse his entire body at once. <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">is that</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a cubit by a cubit by the height</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of three cubits. And the Sages calculated </span>the volume of a ritual bath of this size and determined that <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> waters of a ritual bath </span>measure <span class="gemarra-regular">forty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> As this is derived from the Written Torah, what need is there for a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> transmitted to Moses from Sinai?
The Gemara answers: The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <span class="gemarra-regular">is needed </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to his hair, </span>that it too must be accessible to the water without interposition. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, as Rabba bar Rav Huna said: A single </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hair tied </span>in a knot <span class="gemarra-regular">constitutes an interpositio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> and invalidates the immersion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Three </span>hairs tied together in a knot <span class="gemarra-regular">do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not constitute an interposition, </span>because three hairs cannot be tied so tightly that water cannot penetrate them. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>hairs tied together in a knot, <span class="gemarra-regular">I do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> know </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to hair is a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> transmitted to Moses from Sinai.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">his hair is also </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Torah, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he shall bathe all [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">et</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] his flesh. </span>The superfluous word <span class="it-text">et</span> comes to amplify and include <span class="gemarra-regular">that which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is subordinate to his flesh, and that is hair.</span>
The Gemara answers: The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <span class="gemarra-regular">comes </span>to teach the details of interpositions on the body <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to its majority and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its minority, and with regard to one who is particular </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and one who is not particular, in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Yitzḥak said: By Torah law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>if there is an interposition between a person and the water, and it covers <span class="gemarra-regular">the majority </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>body, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he is particular </span>and wants the interposing substance removed, only then <span class="gemarra-regular">is it </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">an interposition </span>that invalidates immersion in a ritual bath. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if he is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">particular about </span>that substance, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">an interposition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Sages, however, <span class="gemarra-regular">issued a decree </span>prohibiting substances covering <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> majority </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s </span>body with regard to which <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not particular, due to </span>substances covering <span class="gemarra-regular">the majority </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s </span>body with regard to which <span class="gemarra-regular">he is particular</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And, </span>they issued a decree prohibiting substances covering <span class="gemarra-regular">the minority</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>body with regard to which <span class="gemarra-regular">one is particular</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, due to </span>substances covering <span class="gemarra-regular">the majority </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>body with regard to which <span class="gemarra-regular">one is particular.</span>
The Gemara raises a question: Then <span class="gemarra-regular">let us also issue a decree </span>deeming substances covering <span class="gemarra-regular">the minority </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s </span>body with regard to which <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not particular </span>an interposition <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>substances covering <span class="gemarra-regular">the minority </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>body with regard to which <span class="gemarra-regular">one is particular, or alternatively, due to </span>substances covering <span class="gemarra-regular">the majority </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>body with regard to which <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not particular</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara answers: We do not issue that decree, because the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that deems both an interposition covering the minority of his body about which one is particular and an interposition covering the majority of his body about which one is not particular <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">interposition is itself a decree. Shall we </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">rise up </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and issue </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">decree to </span>prevent violation of another <span class="gemarra-regular">decree?</span> In any case, these details with regard to interpositions are neither written nor alluded to in the Torah; rather, they are <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> transmitted to Moses from Sinai.
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ashi said that Rav said that the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions </span>were transmitted to Moses from Sinai. The Gemara challenges this assertion as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">They are</span> written <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Torah, </span>as the fundamental principle that a partition ten handbreadths high establishes a separate domain is derived from the Torah.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As the Master said: </span>The Holy <span class="gemarra-regular">Ark </span>in the Tabernacle was <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span>handbreadths high, as the verse states that its height was a cubit and a half. A cubit contains six handbreadths, so its height totaled nine handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the cover </span>atop the Ark was one <span class="gemarra-regular">handbreadth, which </span>total <span class="gemarra-regular">ten. </span>There is a tradition that the Divine Presence does not descend into the domain of this world, which is derived from the verse that states that the Divine Presence would reveal itself from above the cover of the Ark. Apparently, a partition of ten handbreadths creates a separate domain.
The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary only </span>according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who said: The cubit </span>mentioned with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the building </span>of the Tabernacle and the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">was a </span>large <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit of six </span>handbreadths, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">the cubit</span> mentioned with regard to the sacred <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels was a cubit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of five </span>handbreadths. According to this opinion, the Ark, which was a cubit and a half, and its cover, which was a handbreadth, measured eight and a half handbreadths. Therefore, nothing can be derived with regard to a partition of ten handbreadths.
The Gemara poses a question. <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Meir, who said: All the cubits were medium </span>ones, regular cubits of six handbreadths; <span class="gemarra-regular">what can be said? </span>Apparently, according to his opinion, the laws governing partitions are explicitly stated in the Torah.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to a partition of ten handbreadths is indeed written in the Torah. However, the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <span class="gemarra-regular">comes </span>to teach other <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> concerning partitions, e.g., the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">extending </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">gode</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>according to which an existing partition is extended upward or downward to complete the requisite measure; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">joining [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lavud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>according to which two solid surfaces are joined if they are separated by a gap of less than three handbreadths; <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">the curved wall </span>of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>. A <span class="it-text">sukka</span> is valid even if there are up to four cubits of invalid roofing, provided that this roofing is adjacent to one of the walls of the <span class="it-text">sukka</span>. In that case, the invalid roofing is considered a bent extension of the wall. These concepts are certainly not written in the Torah. 
The Gemara returns to the laws of alleyways: If the cross beam spanning the entrance to an alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">was higher than twenty cubits </span>from the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">and one comes to diminish its </span>height, <span class="gemarra-regular">how much must he diminish </span>it? The Gemara is surprised by the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">How much must he diminish </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">amount that he needs </span>in order to render its height less than twenty cubits.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the space between the cross beam and the ground must, of course, be reduced to twenty cubits. However, when one raises the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">how much </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">the width </span>of the raised section be in order to render the alleyway fit for carrying within it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">handbreadth. Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Four </span>handbreadths.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that these <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree about </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this: The one who said </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">handbreadth holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to utilize </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">beneath the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>spanning the entrance to the alleyway, as he maintains that the cross beam serves as a partition, and the alleyway is considered as if it were sealed by a partition descending from the outer edge of the cross beam that faces the public domain. Since the area beneath the cross beam is part of the alleyway and is less than twenty cubits, there is a conspicuous demarcation for one standing in the alleyway. 

Daf 5a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And the one who said four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the alleyway is considered as if it were sealed from the inside edge of the cross beam, and consequently it is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">to utilize </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">beneath the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam. </span>As the area beneath the cross beam is not part of the alleyway, a significant demarcation, i.e., one of four handbreadths, is required within the alleyway itself.
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, everyone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">agrees that it is permitted to utilize </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">beneath </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they disagree with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, </span>Rav Yosef, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>functions in an alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">as a conspicuous </span><span class="gemarra-regular">marker</span> that demarcates the alleyway from the public domain, and consequently a mere handbreadth is sufficient, as even a handbreadth is sufficiently conspicuous. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, </span>Abaye, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">as a partition, </span>and a partition is not effective for an area of less than four handbreadths. The principle that an outer edge descends and seals the alleyway does not apply if the beam is higher than twenty cubits. In order for it to be considered a partition, there must be at least four handbreadths that are less than twenty cubits beneath the cross beam.
The Gemara proposes an alternative explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if you wish, say </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">that everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">as a conspicuous marker, and here </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree with regard to </span>the relationship between <span class="gemarra-regular">a conspicuous </span><span class="gemarra-regular">marker below, </span>i.e., the raised area of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a conspicuous marker above, </span>i.e., the cross beam. This <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, </span>Rav Yosef, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that governs <span class="gemarra-regular">the conspicuous marker below is like </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">the conspicuous marker above, </span>and one handbreadth suffices. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, </span>Abaye, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that governs <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> conspicuous marker below is like </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">the conspicuous marker above. </span>The lower sign must be more prominent and extend four handbreadths. 
The Gemara proposes yet another explanation of the amoraic dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, say </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">that everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>that fundamentally, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that governs <span class="gemarra-regular">the conspicuous marker below is like</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to the <span class="gemarra-regular">conspicuous marker above, </span>and even a handbreadth should suffice. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here they disagree whether</span> the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">decreed </span>that four handbreadths are necessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span>people treading upon it will erode and <span class="gemarra-regular">diminish </span>the raised area. Rav Yosef is not concerned that it will be diminished and therefore holds that a raised area of a handbreadth is sufficient, whereas Abaye is concerned that the raised area of a handbreadth will erode to less than a handbreadth, rendering it inconspicuous, and the alleyway will come to be utilized in a prohibited manner.
The Gemara considers a new case: If the cross beam spanning the entrance to an alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">was less than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ten handbreadths </span>above the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one hollowed out </span>the ground under the cross beam in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to complete </span>the distance from the ground to the cross beam <span class="gemarra-regular">to ten</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, how much must he hollow out? </span>The Gemara is surprised by the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">How much must he hollow out? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">However much is necessary for it </span>to increase the height to at least ten handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the question is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">How far must </span>the hollowed-out area <span class="gemarra-regular">exten</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> into the alleyway in order to render it permitted to carry throughout the alleyway? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: Four </span>handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Four cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that </span>these <span class="it-text">amora</span><span class="it-text">’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to </span>the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi Asi. As it was stated </span>with regard to the following question: If <span class="gemarra-regular">the side wall of an alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was breache</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> toward its entrance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., close to where the alleyway opens into the public domain, what is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated in the name of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi: If an </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">board four </span>handbreadths long remains of the original wall or is set up where the original wall had ended, the cross beam or side post at the entrance to the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it permitted </span>to carry in the alleyway even if there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a breach </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">up to ten </span>cubits long. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>upright board there, the following distinction applies: If the breach is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>handbreadths, the cross beam or side post <span class="gemarra-regular">renders it permitted </span>to carry in the alleyway, based on the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span>. If the breach is <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>or more handbreadths, the cross beam or side post <span class="gemarra-regular">does not render it permitted </span>to carry. The Gemara proposes that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef, </span>who says that the hollowed-out area need only extend four handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">adopts </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ami, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye, </span>who requires a hollowed-out area of four cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not adopt </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ami.</span>
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that the two cases are not comparable: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in Rav Ami’s case, we are dealing with <span class="gemarra-regular">the final </span>stage <span class="gemarra-regular">of an alleyway, </span>i.e., an alleyway that had at first been properly structured, and only later did it become breached. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>we are dealing with <span class="gemarra-regular">the initial </span>stage <span class="gemarra-regular">of an alleyway, </span>i.e., an alleyway that from the very outset did not fulfill the necessary conditions. In this case: <span class="gemarra-regular">If there are four</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits </span>in the hollowed-out area, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>it is considered an alleyway, and <span class="gemarra-regular">if not, no, </span>it is not considered an alleyway.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: From where do I say </span>that a length of at least four cubits is required? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">An alleyway is permitted by means</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a side post or </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam only if it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">houses </span>opening into courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">and courtyards opening into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as only in that case can it be called an alleyway. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the entire length of the alleyway is only <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths, as is indicated by Rav Yosef’s opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">how can you find this </span>case? Under what circumstances is it possible for such a short alleyway to have courtyards opening into it? Even if there are only two such courtyards, the entrance to each is at least four handbreadths wide.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say that </span>the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">opens </span>into the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">middle wall, </span>i.e., the alleyway is only four handbreadths long but is wide enough to have two entrances opening into two courtyards, this is difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rav Naḥman say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we hold </span>on the authority of tradition: <span class="gemarra-regular">Which is an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway that is permitted by a side post or a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam? Any </span>alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">whose length is greater than its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">widt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and has houses and courtyards opening into it. </span>Accordingly, if the alleyway is only four handbreadths long, its width must be even less than that. Consequently, argues Abaye, a length of at least four cubits is required.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosef, </span>how would he respond to this? Rav Yosef explains that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">open </span>into the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">at its corners. </span>In this way it is possible to have two openings, each of which is at least four handbreadths wide, although the length of the alleyway itself is no greater than four handbreadths, as the four handbreadths of the openings to the courtyards are divided between the width and the length of the alleyway.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">said: From where do I say </span>that a length of at least four cubits is required? <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post that protrudes from the wall </span>on the side <span class="gemarra-regular">of an alleyway </span>into the opening of the alleyway, if its protrusion was <span class="gemarra-regular">less than four cubits, it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is deemed a side post </span>that renders it permitted to carry in the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">and no other side post is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">required to render it permitted </span>to carry in it. However, if it protruded <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits, </span>that section <span class="gemarra-regular">is deemed an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> alleyway, </span>as though there were an additional alleyway within an alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another side post is required to render it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted </span>to carry there. This shows that anything less than four cubits does not have the status of an alleyway, which supports the position of Abaye.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yosef, </span>how would he respond to this? Rav Yosef distinguishes between the cases: With regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to removing its status as a side </span><span class="gemarra-regular">post, </span>this status remains <span class="gemarra-regular">until there are four cubits </span>in the length of the side post. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span>independent <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway, even with </span>a wall of <span class="gemarra-regular">four handbreadths it is also </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway.</span>
The Gemara examines Rami bar Ḥama’s statement cited in the course of the previous discussion. As to the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself: Rami</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Ḥama said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post that protrudes from the wall </span>on the side <span class="gemarra-regular">of an alleyway </span>into the entrance of the alleyway, 

Daf 5b

if its protrusion is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than four cubits, it is deemed a side</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> post </span>that renders it permitted to carry in the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">and no other side post is required to render it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted. </span>However, if it protrudes <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits, </span>that section <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> deemed an alleyway, and another side post is required to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> render it permitted to </span>carry in it. 
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">That side post, </span>which is added in order to permit carrying within the alleyway that was formed by the four-cubit side post, <span class="gemarra-regular">where does one position</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>such that one may carry within the alleyway? The Gemara clarifies its difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">If one positions it alongside </span>the first side post as an addition to it, it looks as if <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">extending </span>the original side post, and it is not noticeable that an extra side post is present.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: He should position it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the extra side post, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the other side </span>of the alleyway, near the opposite wall. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yehoshua, said: Even if you say that he positions</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it alongside </span>the first side post, it is valid, so long as <span class="gemarra-regular">he adds to it or diminishes from it</span> in thickness or height, so that it will be noticeable that it is a side post of its own. 
The Gemara limits the application of Rami bar Ḥama’s ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehoshua, said: We stated </span>this halakha with regard to a side post protruding four cubits into the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">only in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway </span>that is at least <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>cubits wide. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway </span>that is only <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>cubits wide, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to carry within the alleyway without an additional side post, not because the original side post functions as a side post but rather because it sufficiently seals off the entrance to the alleyway such that the <span class="gemarra-regular">standing </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> breached </span>segment. The alleyway is now closed off from all four sides, and the remaining opening to the public domain is regarded as an entrance, as most of that side is closed and only a small part of it is open. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is derived by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inference from a courtyard:  Just as </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, which is not </span>rendered a <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>domain <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post or a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, </span>but actual partitions are required, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>nevertheless rendered a <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>domain even if there are gaps in the partitions, as long <span class="gemarra-regular">as the standing </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than the breached </span>segment in <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway, </span>with regard to which the Sages were lenient, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>rendered a <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>domain <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post or a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, is it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not right </span>that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>rendered a <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>domain <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the standing </span>segment of the partition is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">breached </span>segment?
The Gemara refutes this <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference that was based on the fact that the legal status of a courtyard is more lenient than that of an alleyway, as it is in fact more stringent than that of an alleyway in at least one respect. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is true of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, that </span>as long as <span class="gemarra-regular">its breach is </span>less than <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits it remains a permitted domain, can <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">of an alleyway, </span>which is more stringent, as in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">its breach is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths it is not permitted to carry in the alleyway? Therefore, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of an alleyway cannot be derived from the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a courtyard.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the breach of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">also ten </span>cubits. The Gemara raises a difficulty: But <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">did we state</span> this <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna. But doesn’t Rav Huna </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">hold that the breach </span>of an alleyway is <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, </span>did not come to explain Rav Huna’s position. Rather, he <span class="gemarra-regular">stated his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> own view, </span>and he does not accept Rav Huna’s opinion with regard to the law of a breach in an alleyway.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi </span>went further than Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Even if you say </span>that the law with regard to a side post protruding four cubits into the alleyway applies <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway </span>that is exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>cubits wide, in that it <span class="gemarra-regular">too</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not require an </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">side post. Whichever </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>look at it, you are forced to arrive at this conclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>you say that the <span class="gemarra-regular">standing </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">greater, </span>then the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted, </span>because its <span class="gemarra-regular">standing </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than the breached </span>segment; <span class="gemarra-regular">and if </span>you say that the <span class="gemarra-regular">breached </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater, </span>then the protrusion is <span class="gemarra-regular">deemed a side post, </span>as its width must be less than four cubits.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>might <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that would require an additional side post? Would you suggest that there is yet another possibility, <span class="gemarra-regular">that the two are </span>exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">equal, </span>the standing portion and the breach? <span class="gemarra-regular">This is an uncertainty </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">rabbinic law, </span>as carrying in an alleyway is forbidden only by rabbinic law, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the principle is that where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertainty </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a rabbinic law, </span>one may assume the <span class="gemarra-regular">lenient </span>position, as opposed to an uncertainty arising with respect to a Torah law, where one assumes the stringent position. 
The Gemara considers a new case: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥanin bar Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was breached, </span>

Daf 6a

if it was breached <span class="gemarra-regular">from its side</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the side wall of the alleyway, carrying within the alleyway is prohibited if the breach is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits wide. But if it was breached <span class="gemarra-regular">from its front</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the wall that faces the public domain, carrying within the alleyway is prohibited even if the breach is only <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths wide.
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>such that carrying is prohibited due to a breach <span class="gemarra-regular">from the side </span>only if the breach is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits? This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>you <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that up to ten cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">an entrance. </span>If the breach is <span class="gemarra-regular">in the front, let us also say it is an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">entrance, </span>and carrying should be permitted if the breach is less than ten cubits.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: </span>We are dealing with <span class="gemarra-regular">a case where the breach is in a corner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since <span class="gemarra-regular">people do not make an entrance in a corner, </span>a breach of this kind cannot be viewed as an entrance, and if the breach is larger than four handbreadths it must be sealed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna </span>disagreed with Rav Ḥanin bar Rava and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>There is no distinction between the side and the front, for in <span class="gemarra-regular">both this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">and that, </span>a breach of up to <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths is allowed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so Rav Huna said to Rav Ḥanan bar Rava: Do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not dispute me, as Rav </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">arrived at </span>a place called <span class="gemarra-regular">Damḥarya and performed an action, </span>i.e., issued a practical ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with my </span>opinion. Rav Ḥanan bar Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in response <span class="gemarra-regular">to him: </span>No proof can be brought from that incident, for in that case <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav found an </span>unguarded <span class="gemarra-regular">valle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and fenced it in, </span>i.e., , Rav saw the need to add a safeguard and was therefore stringent in this case. His ruling, however, was not generally applied.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Rav Huna’s opinion stands to reason, as it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagree about the following issue: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a crooked, </span>L-shaped <span class="gemarra-regular">alleywa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> that opens onto the public domain at both ends, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Its law is like </span>that of an alleyway that is <span class="gemarra-regular">open </span>on two opposite sides, and it must be treated in a manner suitable for such an alleyway, i.e., an opening in the form of a doorway must be constructed at both ends, or else such an opening must be constructed at the point where the two arms of the alleyway meet and a side post or a cross beam must be placed at each end. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Its law is like </span>that of an alleyway that is <span class="gemarra-regular">closed </span>on one side, and all that is necessary is a side post or a cross beam at each end.
The Gemara clarifies the particular circumstances of the case: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are we dealing? If you say </span>that the width of the alleyway at the point of the turn is <span class="gemarra-regular">more than ten </span>cubits wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">would Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say that its law is like </span>that of an alleyway that is <span class="gemarra-regular">closed </span>on one side? With an opening of that size, it must be considered like an alleyway that is open on both ends.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, are we not </span>dealing with a case where the width of the alleyway at the point of the turn is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits or less, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rav </span>nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the law </span>of such an alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">is like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that of </span>an alleyway that is <span class="gemarra-regular">open </span>on both ends. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, a breach in the side </span>wall <span class="gemarra-regular">of an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway </span>renders it prohibited to carry even if it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths wide, in accordance with the opinion of Rav Huna.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥanan bar Rava </span>argues that the cases cannot be compared: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is different there, </span>in the case of the L-shaped alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">for many people cross </span><span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>the opening from one arm to the other. Since in practice the alleyway is open to regular traffic, the ruling is stringent even with regard to a small breach.
The Gemara asks: Can it be <span class="gemarra-regular">inferred </span>from this <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rav Huna holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even if many people </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">not cross through </span>the opening, a breach of four handbreadths still prohibits carrying? <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the difference </span>between this case and the case of the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi </span>cited earlier, that an upright board of four handbreadths suffices in order to allow a breach of up to ten cubits?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, there are remnants of a wall </span>that render it difficult to pass through the breach, and therefore that breach does not annul the partitions. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, there are no </span><span class="gemarra-regular">remnants of a wall.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">How does one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">render a public thoroughfare fit </span>for carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? He constructs an </span>opening in the <span class="gemarra-regular">form of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a doorway from here, </span>on one side of the thoroughfare, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a side post or a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>on the other side. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>This is the subject of an early dispute between <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span>, for <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: He constructs a door from here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>on one side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a door from here, </span>on the other side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and when he exits and enters, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">must lock </span>the door. It is not sufficient to construct a symbolic door; rather, there must be a door that actually closes. And <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel say: He constructs a door </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>on one side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a side post or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam from here, </span>on the other side. 
The Gemara raises a fundamental question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Can a public domain be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rendered fit </span>for carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Wasn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said: </span>

Daf 6b

<span class="gemarra-regular">One who has two houses </span>opposite each other <span class="gemarra-regular">on the two sides of the public domain, </span>and he wishes to carry from one house to the other on Shabbat via the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a side post from here, </span>on one side of one of the houses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">side post from here, </span>on the other side. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>he may place <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam from here, </span>from one end of one house, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> an additional cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam from here, </span>from the other side of the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he may carry </span>objects <span class="gemarra-regular">and place </span>them in the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>them, for in this manner he turns the middle area into a private domain. The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: One cannot render a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">public domain fit </span>for carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiru</span><span class="gemarra-italic">v</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in this manner. </span>Apparently, there is no way to establish an absolute public domain fit for carrying by means of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
The Gemara questions its previous conclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if you say </span>that it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">in this manner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>by way of a side post or a cross beam, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot be rendered fit </span>for carrying, <span class="gemarra-regular">but by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">doors </span>it can be <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered fit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for carrying. But </span>this is not true, as <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabba bar bar Ḥana say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>said: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem, were it not for </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">its doors are locked at night, one would be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">liable for </span>carrying in <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>its thoroughfares are regarded <span class="gemarra-regular">as a public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> This shows that the presence of a door is not sufficient to render it permitted to carry in a public domain; rather, the door must actually be locked.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla stated: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">entrances [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">abbulei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Meḥoza, </span>which meet the criteria for a public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">were it not for the fact that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their doors are locked, one </span>would be <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for </span>carrying in <span class="gemarra-regular">them, because </span>they are regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">a public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Apparently, without the actual locking of doors it is impossible to establish a public domain fit for carrying by means of the symbolic partitions of a side post or a cross beam. If so, how can the Sages in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> argue about how to establish a public domain fit for carrying?
Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: </span>The wording of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> must be emended so that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what it says: How </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does one render alleyways that </span>are not themselves public domains but are <span class="gemarra-regular">ope</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> on two opposite sides <span class="gemarra-regular">into the public</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> domain fit </span>for carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He constructs an opening </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">form of a doorway</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from here, </span>on one side of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a side post or a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam from here, </span>on the other side.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> differed on how the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is to be decided with regard to this issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>anonymous <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, and it is sufficient to have the form of a doorway on one side and a side post or cross beam on the other side in order to render it permitted to carry in an alleyway that is open on two opposite sides to the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya, </span>following the position of Beit Hillel, who also require a door on one side.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages concerning the position of Beit Hillel: According <span class="gemarra-regular">to Ḥananya, in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Beit Hillel, must </span>this door <span class="gemarra-regular">be locked </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or need it not be locked? Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said, </span>who, as mentioned earlier, rules in accordance with Beit Hillel: The door <span class="gemarra-regular">need not be locked. And similarly, Rav Mattana </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>The door <span class="gemarra-regular">need not be locked. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mattana said: A case </span>involving this very issue <span class="gemarra-regular">happened to me, and Shmuel said to me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The door <span class="gemarra-regular">need not be locked. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">They raised a dilemma before Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Anan </span>with regard to this issue: <span class="gemarra-regular">Need </span>the door <span class="gemarra-regular">be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> locked or need </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">not be locked? He said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">see these </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">entrances of Neharde’a</span> that open on two opposite sides into the public domain, the gateways of <span class="gemarra-regular">which were filled up halfway with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">earth, </span>so that the doors themselves could not possibly be locked. <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Shmuel </span>regularly <span class="gemarra-regular">goes in and out </span>through them, <span class="gemarra-regular">but has never said anything to </span>the people of Neharde’a about them. This shows that it is not necessary for the doors to be locked.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana </span>rejected this proof and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Those </span>doors in Neharde’a <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>partially <span class="gemarra-regular">blocked, </span>and therefore there was no need to lock them, but in general, the door of an alleyway that opens on both sides into the public domain must be locked.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rav Naḥman came </span>to Neharde’a, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: Clear away the earth, </span>so that the doors can be locked. The Gemara attempts to understand Rav Naḥman’s instruction: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that Rav Naḥman</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that the door of an alleyway that is open on two opposite sides <span class="gemarra-regular">must be locked. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this is not proof. In order for carrying to be permitted in such an alleyway, it is enough that the doors <span class="gemarra-regular">be fit to be locked</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they are not </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">locked.</span>
The Gemara describes <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain crooked, </span>L-shaped <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway that was in Neharde’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon which they imposed the stringency of Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the stringency of Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and required it </span>to have <span class="gemarra-regular">doors. </span>The Gemara attempts to understand this ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stringency of Rav, </span>namely, that <span class="gemarra-regular">which he said, </span>that an L-shaped alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">is regarded like </span>an alleyway that is <span class="gemarra-regular">open </span>on two opposite sides. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>this is difficult, for <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t Rav say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the law follows the </span>anonymous <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, who says that even an open alleyway itself does not require doors, and that an opening in the form of a doorway suffices? 
The Gemara answers: They required doors <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya. But </span>this too is difficult, for if the doors were required in accordance with Shmuel’s opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t Shmuel say </span>that an L-shaped alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">is regarded like </span>an alleyway that is <span class="gemarra-regular">closed</span> on one side, which does not need any doors at all? The Gemara explains: The doors were required <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, who said </span>that an L-shaped alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">is regarded like </span>an alleyway that is <span class="gemarra-regular">open </span>on two opposite sides. Therefore, they adopted the stringencies of both Rav and Shmuel: Rav’s stringency that an L-shaped alleyway is deemed an open alleyway, and Shmuel’s stringency that an open alleyway requires a door.
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">But do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we adopt the </span>respective <span class="gemarra-regular">stringencies</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of two </span>authorities who disagree on a series of issues? <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is always in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel, but one who wishes to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">act in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do so, </span>and one who wishes to act <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with the opinion of Beit Hillel may do so. </span>If he wishes to adopt both <span class="gemarra-regular">the leniencies of Beit Shammai </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">the leniencies of Beit Hillel, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wicked person. </span>And if he wishes to adopt both <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stringencies of Beit Shammai and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">the stringencies of Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Hillel, with regard to him the verse states: “The fool </span><span class="gemarra-regular">walks in darkness” </span>(Ecclesiastes 2:14). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>he should act <span class="gemarra-regular">either in accordance with Beit Shammai, </span>following both <span class="gemarra-regular">their leniencies</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and their stringencies, or in accordance with Beit Hillel, </span>following both <span class="gemarra-regular">their leniencies and their stringencies.</span>
The Gemara first raises a problem concerning the wording of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is itself</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> difficult </span>to understand, because it contains an internal contradiction between its clauses: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is always</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel, and then</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you reversed </span>that and <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who wishes to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> act in accordance with the view of Beit Shammai may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do so. </span>
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita’s</span> statement that a person may act as he wishes was made <span class="gemarra-regular">before the Divine Voice </span>emerged and announced that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is always in accordance with Beit Hillel; and <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>the statement that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is always in accordance with Beit Hillel was made <span class="gemarra-regular">after the Divine Voice </span>issued this ruling.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>a different answer: Both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>statement were made <span class="gemarra-regular">after the Divine </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Voice </span>announced that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with Beit Hillel, 

Daf 7a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the latter statement <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua, who does not pay attention to a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Divine Voic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that attempts to intervene in matters of <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, for according to him, the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel has not yet been decided. 
The Gemara suggests yet another resolution: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> saying: Wherever you find two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">amora</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who disagree with each other in the manner of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the disputes between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, one should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not act either in accordance with the leniency of the</span> one <span class="gemarra-regular">Master and in accordance with the leniency of </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, </span>nor should one act <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stringency of </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">Master and in accordance with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stringency of </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Master. Rather, one should act either</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">the leniencies and the stringencies of</span> the one <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, or in accordance with </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">the leniencies</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the stringencies </span>of the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Master. </span>
All of this is suggested to explain the wording of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">In any case, it is difficult </span>to explain the law with regard to the alleyway in Neharde’a, concerning which they simultaneously adopted the stringencies of both Rav and Shmuel.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>In fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">acted entirely in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, </span>and the reason that they required doors and did not rely on the opening in the form of a doorway alone is due to that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rav Huna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>This is the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; however, a </span>public <span class="gemarra-regular">ruling is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not issued to that effect </span><span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>. Although Rav maintains that an opening in the form of a doorway is sufficient in an open alleyway, a public ruling is not issued to that effect; rather, the ruling is stringent, in accordance with Ḥananya’s position, and requires doors. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Adda bar Ahava </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said, as </span>Rav Adda bar Ahava <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that Rav said with regard to the same issue: This is the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a </span>public <span class="gemarra-regular">ruling is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> issued to that effect, what can be said? </span>Why did the residents of Neharde’a adopt the stringencies of the two authorities? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheizvi said: </span>The principle of dictating <span class="gemarra-regular">when we do not act in accordance with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the stringencies of two </span>authorities applies only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the two stringencies <span class="gemarra-regular">contradict one another. </span>In these types of cases, following both stringencies would result in an internal contradiction. 
The Gemara illustrates this principle with <span class="gemarra-regular">an example </span>from the laws governing <span class="gemarra-regular">the spine </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and skull. As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The spine</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the skull </span>of a corpse that are <span class="gemarra-regular">incomplete </span>do not impart ritual impurity via a tent as a corpse would; rather, they impart impurity only through contact or if they are carried as individual bones. This basic law was unanimously accepted, but the details were the subject of dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">How much </span>is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a deficiency in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">spine </span>for this purpose? <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: </span>If it is missing <span class="gemarra-regular">two vertebrae, and Beit Hillel say: </span>Even if it is missing only <span class="gemarra-regular">one vertebra. And </span>similarly, they argued over the deficiency <span class="gemarra-regular">in the skull: Beit Shammai say: </span>It must be missing piece the <span class="gemarra-regular">size of a drill hole, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel say: </span>It must be missing an amount that, <span class="gemarra-regular">when removed from a living </span>person, would cause him <span class="gemarra-regular">to die, </span>which is a larger amount. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel argued <span class="gemarra-regular">likewise</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with respect to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a kosher animal suffering from a wound or illness that will cause it to die within twelve months, and which is prohibited to be eaten even after the required ritual slaughter. Beit Shammai say that an animal is regarded as a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span> if it is missing two vertebrae, while Beit Hillel hold that it is a <span class="it-text">tereifa</span> if it lacks even one. In such a situation, a person must not be stringent with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="it-text">tereifa</span> in accordance with the view of Beit Hillel, and at the same time be stringent with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of ritual impurity of a corpse in accordance with the view of Beit Shammai, for the two disputes relate to the same issue, and one must not act in accordance with two contradictory opinions.
Rav Sheizvi continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">case where </span>the two stringencies <span class="gemarra-regular">do not contradict one another, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we may </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">act </span>in accordance with the stringencies of two authorities. Therefore, the stringencies adopted in the case of the alleyway in Neharde’a were legitimate, for the two stringencies related to two separate issues: Rav’s stringency was that an L-shaped alleyway is regarded like an open alleyway, and Shmuel’s stringency was that an open alleyway requires a door.
The Gemara challenges Rav Sheizvi’s assertion: Is it true that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not act </span>in accordance with the stringencies of two authorities in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the two stringencies <span class="gemarra-regular">contradict one another? Rav Mesharshiya raised</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Akiva, who gathered </span>the fruit of <span class="gemarra-regular">a citron </span>tree <span class="gemarra-regular">on the first of </span>the month of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shevat and applied</span> the laws of <span class="gemarra-regular">two tithe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to it. </span>After <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and the first tithe have been separated, an additional tithe is separated from what is left. During the first, second, fourth, and fifth years of the Sabbatical cycle, second tithe is set aside to be taken to Jerusalem and eaten there by its owner, while during the third and sixth years, poor man’s tithe is set aside to be distributed to the needy. When tithing the fruit picked on the first of Shevat, Rabbi Akiva set aside both additional tithes, second tithe and poor man’s tithe: He set aside <span class="gemarra-regular">one in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai, </span>who say that the new year for trees begins on the first of Shevat, and as that day belongs to the new year, a tithe must be set aside in accordance with the law of that year; and he set aside <span class="gemarra-regular">one in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel, </span>that the new year for trees is the fifteenth of Shevat, and any fruit picked prior to that date must be tithed in accordance with the law of the previous year. Apparently, Rabbi Akiva adopted for himself two contradictory stringencies.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Akiva </span>did not act in this way in order to be stringent in accordance with both opinions, but because <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was in doubt with regard to his tradition and did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not know whether Beit Hillel said </span>the New Year for trees falls <span class="gemarra-regular">on the first of Shevat or on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fifteenth of Shevat, and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">he acted stringently here and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stringently there.</span>
The Gemara resumes its discussion of alleyways that are open on two opposite sides. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef sat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Rav Huna, and he sat and said: Rav Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: The dispute </span>between the anonymous first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and Ḥananya refers <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a main street [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">seratya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>on one side of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a main street</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from here, </span>on the other side. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>it refers to a case where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a plaza [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pelatya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here, </span>on one side of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a plaza</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from here, </span>on the other side.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> main street from here, </span>on one side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">valley from here, </span>on the other side, a valley being a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, which is neither a public domain nor a private domain, in which carrying is prohibited on Shabbat by rabbinic decree, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a valley from here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>on one side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a valley from here, </span>on the other side, <span class="gemarra-regular">one constructs </span>an opening in the <span class="gemarra-regular">form </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a doorway from here, </span>on one side of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>places <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post or a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>on the other side. One is thereby permitted to carry in the alleyway even according to the opinion of Ḥananya.
The Gemara raises a question about this ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, </span>if you say that where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a main street from here, </span>on one side of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a valley from here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>on the other side, it is sufficient to <span class="gemarra-regular">construct </span>an opening in <span class="gemarra-regular">the form of a doorway from here, </span>on one side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a side post or a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam from here, </span>on the other side, <span class="gemarra-regular">was it necessary</span> to state that these are sufficient if there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> valley from here, </span>on one side of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a valley from her</span>e, on the other side? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>intended <span class="gemarra-regular">to say: </span>If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a main street from here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>on one side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a valley from here, </span>on the other side, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is considered as if there were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a valley from here, </span>on one side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a valley </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>on the other side.
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>when Rav Yosef reported this ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">he concluded</span> with a statement <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda </span>himself, without attributing it to one of Rav Yehuda’s teachers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the alleyway terminated in a backyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a closed-off area behind a group of houses, then even if there is a breach in the wall between the yard and the public domain beyond it, <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is needed </span>on this side of the alleyway, as it is considered closed. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav Yosef: This </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yehuda is </span>a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>his teacher <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, </span>and not of his other teacher, Rav. 

Daf 7b

<span class="gemarra-regular">For if</span> it is a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav, </span>the apparent contradiction between one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav </span>and another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav </span>poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty in two </span>ways. The first is with regard to the fact that this alleyway opens into the public domain on two opposite sides, and the second is based on that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway was breached along the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>length of its back wall <span class="gemarra-regular">into a courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">the courtyard was breached opposite it </span>into the public domain, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to carry in <span class="gemarra-regular">the courtyard, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry in <span class="gemarra-regular">the alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since this alleyway is now open on two opposite sides to the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>should this be the ruling? In this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">let it be like an alleyway that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">terminates in a backyard, </span>where Rav Yehuda ruled that nothing further is needed to permit carrying.
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">I do not know </span>in accordance with which of his teachers Rav Yehuda issued this ruling. All I know is that there was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in a shepherds’ village </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway terminated in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">backyard, and </span>the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Yehuda </span>for a ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he did not require anything </span>to render it permitted to carry in the alleyway. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if, </span>as you say, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is difficult </span>if we say that he issued his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rav, let it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be </span>suggested that he issued it <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of </span>his other teacher, <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">there will be no </span><span class="gemarra-regular">difficulty.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now that Rav Sheshet said to Rav Shmuel bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and some say </span>that he said <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosef bar Abba: I will explain to you </span>Rav’s statement with regard to an alleyway that was breached along the entire length of its back wall into a courtyard. One must make a distinction based on the nature of the case: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the residents of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together. In that case, Rav permits carrying in the alleyway and is not concerned with the breach into the courtyard, as the courtyard and the alleyway are treated as a single domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">There </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together. In that case, Rav prohibits carrying in the alleyway, because the alleyway now has new residents, i.e., the residents of the courtyard, who did not participate in the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, and they prevent the residents of the alleyway from carrying.
Consequently, it can be said that Rav Yehuda’s statement with regard to an alleyway that terminates in a backyard is in accordance with the opinion of Rav, as the apparent contradiction between one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav</span> and another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav also </span>poses <span class="gemarra-regular">no difficulty. Here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>where Rav Yehuda permits carrying in an alleyway that terminates in a backyard, he is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the residents of the courtyard and the residents of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> alleyway established a joint </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>where Rav prohibits carrying in an alleyway that was breached along the entire length of its back wall into a courtyard, he is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the residents of the courtyard and the residents of the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">did not establish a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> joint </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>

Daf 8a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to what first entered</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> our minds, </span>that Rav and Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree both </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the residents of the alleyway and the residents of the yard <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together, <span class="gemarra-regular">as well as</span> in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together, explanation is necessary. The Gemara seeks to explicate <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree in </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they established</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span>joint <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">on what </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they did not establish a </span>joint <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>That is to say, what is the crux of the argument in these two cases?
The Gemara explains: In the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they did not establish </span>a joint <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>Rav and Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree concerning </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing an alleyway that <span class="gemarra-regular">appears</span> closed <span class="gemarra-regular">from the outside. </span>Outside the alleyway there is a wider courtyard, so that from the perspective of those standing in the courtyard, the breach at the end of the alleyway seems like an entrance, and the alleyway appears to be closed, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">even from the inside</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>From the perspective of those inside the alleyway, the breach is even with the walls of the alleyway, so that the breach does not look like an entrance, and the alleyway appears to be open. The dispute revolves around the question of whether an alleyway of this kind is considered open or closed. According to the authority who says that it is considered a closed alleyway, one is permitted to carry within an alleyway that terminates in a backyard in this manner.
And in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they established a </span>joint <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, they disagree about </span>the principle stated by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef. For Rav Yosef said: </span>The allowance to carry in an alleyway that terminates in a backyard <span class="gemarra-regular">was only taught </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">terminates</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the middle of the backyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that when viewed from the yard, the alleyway appears to be closed. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if it <span class="gemarra-regular">terminates on </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">the sides of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the backyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that the alleyway and yard appear continuous, carrying in the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span>took the discussion one step further and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: That which you say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Where the alleyway terminates <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle of the backyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">was only stated </span>with regard to a case where the breach in the back wall of the alleyway into the yard and the breach in the facing wall of the yard into the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not opposite one another. But </span>if the two breaches <span class="gemarra-regular">are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> opposite one another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> carrying within the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mesharshiya </span>continued this line of thought and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: That</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which you say: </span>If the two breaches <span class="gemarra-regular">are not opposite</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one another, </span>carrying within the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only stated </span>with regard to the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the backyard</span> belongs to <span class="gemarra-regular">many </span>people. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the yard </span>belongs to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>single <span class="gemarra-regular">individual</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he might sometime change his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mind about it and build houses </span>in that part of the yard that is wider than the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">will become like an alleyway that terminates on </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">the sides of the backyard, </span>which is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>If the owner of the yard closes off one side of the yard with houses, the alleyway will no longer terminate in the middle of the yard, but on one of its sides, in which case carrying will be forbidden. Consequently, although the houses have not yet been built, adjustments must be made in the alleyway to permit carrying, so that no problems should arise in the future.
Rav Mesharshiya adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where do you say that we distinguish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> between a backyard </span>that belongs to <span class="gemarra-regular">many </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">and a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> backyard </span>that belongs to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>single <span class="gemarra-regular">individual? As Ravin bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Adda said that Rabbi Yitzḥak said: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> incident involving a certain alleyway, </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">one of its sides</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> terminated in the se</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one of its sides </span><span class="gemarra-regular">terminated in a refuse heap</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> resulting in an alleyway closed on both sides. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the incident came before Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, so that he may rule on whether these partitions are sufficient or whether some additional construction is necessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he did not say </span>anything <span class="gemarra-regular">about it, neither permission</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor prohibition. </span>
The Gemara clarifies: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not state </span>a ruling indicating <span class="gemarra-regular">a prohibition </span>to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span> the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">for partitions, </span>i.e., the sea and the refuse heap, indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">stand, </span>and the alleyway is closed off on both sides. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">did not state </span>a ruling granting <span class="gemarra-regular">permission </span>to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we are concerned that perhaps the refuse heap will be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">removed </span>from its present spot, leaving one side of the alleyway open. <span class="gemarra-regular">And, </span>alternatively, perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">the sea will raise up </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sand, </span>and the sandbank will intervene between the end of the alleyway and the sea, so that the sea can no longer be considered a partition for the alleyway.
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are we </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">concerned that perhaps the refuse heap will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be removed? But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">A refuse heap in the public domain </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths high, </span>so that it has the status of a private domain, and there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a window above </span>the pile of refuse, i.e., the window is in a house adjacent to the refuse heap, <span class="gemarra-regular">we may throw </span>refuse from the window <span class="gemarra-regular">onto </span>the heap <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat. </span>Carrying on Shabbat from one private domain, i.e., the house, to another, i.e., the refuse heap, is permitted. We are not concerned that someone might remove some of the refuse, thus lowering the heap until it is no longer a private domain, such that throwing refuse upon it is prohibited. This seems to present a contradiction, for in some cases we are concerned that the refuse heap might be removed, but in other cases we are not.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>we <span class="gemarra-regular">distinguish between a public refuse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> heap and a private refuse heap, </span>such that in the case of a private refuse heap we cannot assume that it will remain in place permanently, as it is likely to be emptied at some point.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Here, too, </span>we <span class="gemarra-regular">distinguish between a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> backyard </span>belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">many </span>people, where buildings are not likely to be added, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a backyard </span>belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>single <span class="gemarra-regular">individual, </span>where he might consider making changes and add buildings. 
The case involving an alleyway opening on one side to the sea and on the other side to a refuse heap was brought before Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, who did not rule on the matter. The Gemara inquires: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis </span>of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s generation, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>was their opinion with regard to this case? The fact that we are told that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi did not want to issue a ruling indicates that his colleagues disagreed with him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef bar Avdimi said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis prohibit</span> carrying in such an alleyway. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with the statement of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis. There</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are some who state </span>a different version of the previous statements as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef bar Avdimi said: It was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis permit </span>carrying in such an alleyway. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not in accordance with the opinion of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis. </span>
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Mareimar would block off </span>the ends of the alleyways of <span class="gemarra-regular">Sura, </span>which opened to a river, <span class="gemarra-regular">with net</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to serve as partitions. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said: </span>Just as <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are concerned that perhaps the sea will raise up sand,</span> so too, we are concerned that the river will raise up sand, and hence we cannot rely on its banks to serve as partitions. 
The Gemara further relates: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> certain crooked </span>L-shaped <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway that was in Sura, </span>the residents of the place <span class="gemarra-regular">rolled up a mat </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">placed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it at the turn </span>to serve as a side post to permit carrying within it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: This </span>was done <span class="gemarra-regular">neither in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav nor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">According</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Rav, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>a crooked L-shaped alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">is like that of an </span>alleyway that is <span class="gemarra-regular">open </span>on two opposite sides, it <span class="gemarra-regular">requires </span>an opening in <span class="gemarra-regular">the form of a doorway. </span>And even <span class="gemarra-regular">according to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shmuel, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is like that of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span>alleyway that is <span class="gemarra-regular">closed </span>at one side, so that carrying is permitted by means of a side post, <span class="gemarra-regular">this applies only </span>to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">a proper side </span><span class="gemarra-regular">post </span>was erected. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>mat, <span class="gemarra-regular">once</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the wind blows upon it, it throws it over; it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing </span>and is totally ineffective. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if a peg was inserted </span>into the mat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>thus the mat was properly <span class="gemarra-regular">attached </span>to the wall, it is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">attached </span>and serves as an effective side post. 
The Gemara examines Rav Yirmeya bar Abba’s statement cited in the course of the previous discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">As to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the matter itself, Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said that Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: An alleyway that was breached along the entire </span>length of its back wall <span class="gemarra-regular">into a courtyard, and </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> courtyard was breached on its opposite side </span>into the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">the courtyard is permitted </span>for carrying, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway is prohibited </span>for carrying. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Ulla said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Beivai bar Abaye: My Master, is this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">our Mishna? A smaller courtyard that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was breached </span>along the entire length of one of its walls <span class="gemarra-regular">into a larger </span>courtyard, the <span class="gemarra-regular">larger one is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted </span>for carrying, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the smaller one is prohibited, because</span> the breach <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>regarded <span class="gemarra-regular">as the entrance to the larger</span> courtyard. With regard to the larger courtyard, the breach running the entire length of the smaller courtyard is considered like an entrance in one of its walls, for the breach is surrounded on both sides by the remaining portions of the wall of the larger courtyard, and therefore carrying is permitted. With regard to the smaller courtyard, however, one wall is missing in its entirety, and therefore carrying is forbidden. This seems to be exactly the same as the case of an alleyway that was breached along the entire length of its back wall into a courtyard. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">He, </span>Rav Beivai bar Abaye, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him, </span>Rabba bar Ulla: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>this was learned <span class="gemarra-regular">from there </span>alone, <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would have said </span>that we must distinguish between the cases: The Mishna’s ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">only applies in a place where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">many people do not tread. </span>The breach between the smaller and larger courtyard will not cause more people to pass through the larger courtyard, and therefore it remains a unit of its own. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in a place where many people </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tread, </span>i.e., in the case where a courtyard is breached on one side into an alleyway and on the other side into the public domain, you might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that carrying is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard as well, </span>owing to the people passing through it from the alleyway to the public domain.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learn this as well, </span>that the mere fact that many people tread through a courtyard does not forbid carrying, for we learned in the Tosefta: <span class="gemarra-regular">A courtyard </span>that was properly surrounded by partitions, <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">many people enter on this </span>side <span class="gemarra-regular">and exit on that </span>side, is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a public domain </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that in cases of doubt, we say that the person or article is pure, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>it is still <span class="gemarra-regular">a private domain </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, we see that with regard to Shabbat, the sole criterion is the existence of partitions, and the fact that many people pass through the courtyard does not impair its status as a private domain.
The Gemara refutes this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>this was derived <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>alone, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have said </span>that this <span class="gemarra-regular">only applies </span>in a case where the two breaches are <span class="gemarra-regular">not opposite one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> another, </span>

Daf 8b

<span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if the two breaches <span class="gemarra-regular">are opposite </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one another, </span>you might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered a private domain even with regard to Shabbat. Rav therefore teaches us that even if the breaches of the courtyard line up with each other, carrying is nonetheless permitted therein.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabba, who said </span>that where the alleyway terminates in a backyard and the breaches <span class="gemarra-regular">are one opposite another, </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited, how does </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">construe Rav’s </span>case? Rav’s ruling must refer to a case where the breaches <span class="gemarra-regular">are not one opposite another, </span>and if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">why</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>rulings? The essence of this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, that the yard is deemed a private domain with regard to Shabbat, was already stated in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, so why did Rav need to teach another <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the very same issue? 
The Gemara explains that there is a novelty in Rav’s teaching: <span class="gemarra-regular">If one </span>learned the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, alone, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have said </span>that this ruling that the courtyard is a private domain with regard to Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">only applies </span>to the issue <span class="gemarra-regular">of throwing, </span>i.e., that one who throws from the public domain into this courtyard is liable, since it is considered a private domain according to Torah law. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>to allow <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying </span>in it like a proper private domain, you might <span class="gemarra-regular">say no, </span>that the Sages forbade carrying in it, owing to the many people passing through it. Rav therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that we are not concerned about this, and that carrying in the yard is permitted, even by rabbinic law. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagree about the following matter: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway</span> that is <span class="gemarra-regular">shaped like a centipede</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a long alleyway that opens to the public domain but with a series of small alleyways branching off of it on both of its sides, all of which also open to the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>An opening in <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> form of a doorway is made for the large </span>alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">and all the </span>small alleyways <span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post or a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him: According to whom </span>do you state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Apparently according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>a crooked L-shaped alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of an alleyway that is <span class="gemarra-regular">closed </span>at one side. For in this case of an alleyway that is shaped like a centipede, when each of the smaller alleyways connects to the larger alleyway, it forms a crooked L-shaped alleyway. However, if the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is indeed in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the form of a doorway </span>needed <span class="gemarra-regular">for it? </span>According to Shmuel, an alleyway of this kind only requires a side post or a cross beam at each end in order to permit carrying within it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the crooked, </span>L-shaped <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway in Neharde’a, </span>which was Shmuel’s place of residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t they take </span><span class="gemarra-regular">into consideration </span>the position <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav? </span>This indicates that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in practice follows Rav as opposed to Shmuel.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: </span>An alleyway made like a centipede can be rendered fit for one to carry within it as follows: An opening in <span class="gemarra-regular">the form of a doorway is made for all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the small alleyways <span class="gemarra-regular">on this </span>one of their <span class="gemarra-regular">sides, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the other side is permitted by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">side post or a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara considers a new case: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Taḥalifa said in the name of Rav Kahana bar Minyumi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who said <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rav Kahana bar Malkiyu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who said <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rav Kahana, the teacher</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav; and some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana bar Malkiyu</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is Rav Kahana, the teacher of Rav: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway that </span>opens into the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">its one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> side </span>being <span class="gemarra-regular">long and its other side </span>being <span class="gemarra-regular">short</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span>i.e., one side juts out into the public domain more than the other, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is as follows: If the difference in length between the two sides is <span class="gemarra-regular">less</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than four cubits, the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam is placed diagonally </span>across the opening between the ends of the two walls of the alleyway. If, however, the difference is <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits</span> or more, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam is placed </span>straight <span class="gemarra-regular">across </span>the alleyway at the end <span class="gemarra-regular">of the short </span>side, i.e., at the end of the short side straight across toward the corresponding spot on the longer wall such that the beam is perpendicular to both walls, and no use may be made of the portion of the alleyway that lies beyond the cross beam. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>disagreed and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> placed </span>straight <span class="gemarra-regular">across </span>the alleyway at the end <span class="gemarra-regular">of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> short </span>side.
Rava added: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will state</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> my reason, and I will state their reason. I will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> state my reason: What is the reason for a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam? </span>To function <span class="gemarra-regular">as a conspicuous marker </span>that separates the alleyway from the public domain, so that the residents of the alleyway should know the boundary within which carrying is permitted, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>when placed <span class="gemarra-regular">diagonally, </span>the cross beam <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sufficiently <span class="gemarra-regular">conspicuous. </span>Those who see people carrying in the section extending past the short side will think that one is generally permitted to carry in a public domain. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">I will state their reason </span>as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason for a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam? To</span> function <span class="gemarra-regular">as a partition, </span>that is to say, the cross beam is considered as though it descended to the ground, creating a fourth wall for the alleyway. Hence, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>when placed <span class="gemarra-regular">diagonally, it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a partition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana said: Since this </span>involves <span class="gemarra-italic">halakhot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>Sages named <span class="gemarra-regular">Kahana</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> I too <span class="gemarra-regular">will say something </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to it: That which you said, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is placed diagonally </span>across the alleyway, this <span class="gemarra-regular">was only said </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the diagonal is no more than </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if the diagonal is more than ten </span>cubits, then even if the width of the alleyway itself is less than ten cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">all agree that </span>the cross beam <span class="gemarra-regular">must be placed </span>straight <span class="gemarra-regular">across </span>the alleyway at the end of <span class="gemarra-regular">the short </span>side, for an entrance wider than ten cubits cannot be permitted by a cross beam, and here the entire length under the cross beam is considered an entrance.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised </span>before the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">utilizing </span>and carrying in the area <span class="gemarra-regular">beneath the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>spanning the opening of an alleyway, which the beam permits carrying? Opinions differ on the matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, Rabbi Ḥiyya, and Rabbi Yoḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: It is permitted to utilize </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">beneath the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shmuel, Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi, and Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon ben Lakish said: It is prohibited to utilize </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">beneath the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam.</span>
The Gemara suggests a way to understand this dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>that these <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">argue over the following </span>issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">that Master, </span>representing those who permit it, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: A </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam serves </span>in an alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">as a conspicuous marker </span>that separates it from the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Master, </span>representing those who prohibit it, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: A </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam serves as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a partition.</span>
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, everyone </span>might <span class="gemarra-regular">agree </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam serves as a conspicuous </span><span class="gemarra-regular">marker, but here they argue over the following: Master, </span>representing those who forbid it, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the conspicuous marker </span>is intended for those situated <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the alleyway, and hence the area outside the inner edge of the cross beam may not be used; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Master, </span>representing those who permit it, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the conspicuous marker </span>is intended for those <span class="gemarra-regular">outside</span> in the public domain, and it is therefore permitted to carry up to the outer edge of the cross beam.
The Gemara proposes an alternative explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, </span>you can <span class="gemarra-regular">say that everyone </span>agrees that a cross beam permits carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">as a partition, and here they argue over the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> following </span>issue: <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the inner edge</span> of the cross beam <span class="gemarra-regular">descends </span>to the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">and seals</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> off </span>the alleyway, and therefore under the cross beam is not within the closed-off area; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam’s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">outer edge descends </span>to the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">and seals off </span>the alleyway, and therefore it is permitted to carry even in the area beneath the cross beam. Consequently, there is no need to connect the dispute with regard to utilizing the area beneath the cross beam to the dispute with regard to the nature of the cross beam.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: All concede </span>that utilizing the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the side posts </span>placed at the entrance to an alleyway to permit carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited, </span>for a side post functions as a partition, and therefore one may only use the space up to its inner edge, but no further.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama raised a dilemma before Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥisda: What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case where a person <span class="gemarra-regular">inserted two pegs in the two alleyway walls, </span>one in each wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the outside </span>of the entrance facing the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he placed a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">top of </span>the pegs, such that the beam is attached to the front of the alleyway walls instead of on top of them? Does this cross beam permit carrying within the alleyway?
Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: According to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who permits </span>utilizing the area beneath the cross beam, carrying within the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited, </span>for he holds that the cross beam’s outer edge is the critical one, and here this outer edge is positioned outside the alleyway and therefore cannot permit it. Whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the statement of </span>the authority <span class="gemarra-regular">who prohibits </span>utilizing the area beneath the cross beam, carrying in the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted, </span>for the cross beam’s inner edge is attached to the entrance of the alleyway.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, </span>however, disagreed and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Even according to the opinion of </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who prohibits </span>utilizing the area beneath the cross beam, carrying in the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited, for we require </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>that permits the alleyway be placed <span class="gemarra-regular">on top </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the walls of <span class="gemarra-regular">the alleyway, and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not.</span> A cross beam that merely touches the alleyway from the outside does not permit it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Mattana raised an objection to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>being used to render an alleyway permitted for carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>

Daf 9a

<span class="gemarra-regular">drawn away </span>from the alleyway walls <span class="gemarra-regular">or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> suspende</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in the air, the following distinction applies: If the cross beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>handbreadths from the walls, <span class="gemarra-regular">one is not required to bring a different </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, </span>for it is considered attached to the walls based on the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span>, which views two solid surfaces as connected if the gap between them is less than three handbreadths wide. However, if the distance is <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>or more handbreadths from the walls, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is required to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bring a different </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>in order to permit carrying in the alleyway. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, </span>who holds that the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span> applies to a gap of up to four handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>If the cross beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than four </span>handbreadths from the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">one is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> required to bring a different </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam; </span>but if the distance is <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths from the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is required</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to bring a different </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam.</span>
The Gemara wishes to clarify the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not</span> that when the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> speaks of a cross beam that is <span class="gemarra-regular">drawn away </span>from the alleyway walls, it is referring to a cross beam that is distanced from the alleyway walls and situated <span class="gemarra-regular">on the outside </span>in the public domain, similar to the case of the cross beam resting on pegs mentioned above? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>when it speaks of a cross beam that is <span class="gemarra-regular">suspended, </span>isn’t it referring to a cross beam that is distanced from the alleyway walls and placed <span class="gemarra-regular">on the inside </span>in the alleyway? This interpretation contradicts Rava’s statement above that disqualifies such a cross beam.
The Gemara rejects this interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>the cross beam that is drawn away, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that, </span>the crossbeam that is suspended, are located <span class="gemarra-regular">on the inside </span>of the alleyway. The difference between them is that the cross beam that is <span class="gemarra-regular">drawn </span><span class="gemarra-regular">away </span>is distanced from the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">from one direction, </span>while a <span class="gemarra-regular">suspended </span>cross beam does not lie on the alleyway walls at all, but is distanced from them <span class="gemarra-regular">from both </span><span class="gemarra-regular">directions. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that if the cross beam is distanced from the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one direction, we say </span>that the principle of <span class="gemarra-italic">lavud</span> applies, and it is as if the cross beam is joined to the wall; but if it is distanced from the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">from two directions, we do not say </span>that the principle of <span class="gemarra-italic">lavud</span> applies. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, therefore, comes and <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that there is no difference in this regard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> refers to a cross beam that is <span class="gemarra-regular">drawn away </span>from the walls <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">suspended </span>in the air. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what are the circumstances </span>where this would be the case? <span class="gemarra-regular">For example, where he inserted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">two bent pegs on </span>the tops of <span class="gemarra-regular">the two alleyway </span><span class="gemarra-regular">walls, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the height </span>of the pegs from the top of the walls <span class="gemarra-regular">is less than three </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">and their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bend </span>inward <span class="gemarra-regular">is less than three handbreadths, </span>and a cross beam rests on top of them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we either say </span><span class="gemarra-italic">lavud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., we consider the cross beam to be virtually extended and thus connected to the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">or we say </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>pressed down, that we consider the cross beam to be pressed down vertically; but <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say </span>both <span class="gemarra-italic">lavud</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that even in that case we say that any item adjacent to another with a gap of less than three handbreadths between them is considered connected to it, whether to the side or below, and even in both directions at once.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zakkai taught </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Yoḥanan: </span>The area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">side posts and beneath the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>has the <span class="gemarra-regular">legal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">status </span>of a <span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and it is forbidden to carry in it. Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Exit </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">teach</span> this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">outside</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is not in accordance with the accepted <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, and therefore it should not be made part of the regular learning in the study hall. 
The Gemara records a dispute with regard to the scope of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is reasonable </span>with regard to the area <span class="gemarra-regular">beneath the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, </span>as only the area beneath the cross beam should be considered a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">but between the side posts</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, </span>in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Zakkai. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava said: </span>The entire statement of Rabbi Zakkai is to be rejected, as Rabbi Yoḥanan asserted, and <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the side post</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: From where do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>know to <span class="gemarra-regular">say this, </span>that carrying is permitted even between the side posts? <span class="gemarra-regular">For when Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">A place that has </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">less than four </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by four </span>handbreadths and is located between a public and private domain but belongs to neither has the status of an exempt domain with regard to carrying on Shabbat. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted for </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">the people in the public </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domain </span>as well as <span class="gemarra-regular">the people in the private domain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>use it for <span class="gemarra-regular">loading </span>their burdens <span class="gemarra-regular">onto their shoulders, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so long as they do not exchange </span>objects with one another. Therefore, a place having an area of less than four handbreadths is not considered a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, but rather an exempt domain, where carrying is permitted. Consequently, the area between the side posts should likewise be considered an exempt domain, and carrying should be permitted within it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Abaye </span>said that this offers no proof, as <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>with regard to Rav Dimi’s statement, the area being discussed <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high, </span>setting it apart from the other domains. It is therefore considered a domain in its own right, and has the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of an exempt domain. 
The Gemara considers the position of Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: From where do I </span>know to <span class="gemarra-regular">say this, </span>that the area between the side posts has the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">For Rav Ḥama bar Guria said that Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The area <span class="gemarra-regular">within the opening, </span>i.e., the doorway between two entrance posts that serve as side posts to permit carrying in the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">requires another side post </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to permit </span>carrying there, for the entrance posts alone do not suffice. This demonstrates that it is forbidden to carry in the space between the side posts without another side post.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if you say that </span>this is a case where the doorway <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>an area <span class="gemarra-regular">four by four </span>handbreadths, and therefore an additional side post is required to permit carrying there, this is not a valid argument. <span class="gemarra-regular">For didn’t Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanin bar Rava say that Rav said: </span>The area <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the opening </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if it does not have </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">four by four </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">requires an additional side</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> post </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to permit </span>carrying within it. This indicates that the area between the side posts is not to be used.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava </span>replies that a distinction must be made between the cases: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the case of Rav’s ruling refers to a scenario where the alleyway’s entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">opens to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and thus the space between the entrance posts is also viewed as a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, and an additional side post is required.
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> if the entrance opens <span class="gemarra-regular">to a public domain, what </span>would be the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Would it be <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to carry there even without an additional side post? If so, it follows that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> is more stringent than that of a public domain. However, this seems untenable, for carrying in a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> is prohibited only by rabbinic decree, owing to the similarity between a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> and the public domain. This is similar to a situation where <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permanent resident is </span>down <span class="gemarra-regular">on the ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> while a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stranger is </span>raised up <span class="gemarra-regular">to the highest heaven, </span>the very opposite of the appropriate state of affairs.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>it is possible that this is the ruling, for we can say that <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has found its own type and been awakened</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, as the area within the entranceway is not a defined domain, it doesn’t have the status of an independent domain. Therefore, when it opens into a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, to which it is similar, its status is negated, and it joins with the <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> to form a single unit. However, when it opens into a public domain, it cannot join with it because it is not similar to a public domain, which has a totally different set of laws; and therefore it is considered part of the alleyway, and it is permitted to carry within it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Huna, the son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rava: And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you do not hold </span>that in the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">side posts </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited? But didn’t Rabba bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Ḥana say that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was lined with side posts</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> each </span>one set more than three but <span class="gemarra-regular">less than four </span>handbreadths apart from its neighbor, <span class="gemarra-regular">we have arrived </span>in this matter <span class="gemarra-regular">at the dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis </span>with regard to the measure of <span class="it-text">lavud</span>.
How so? According <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that if the gap between two items is less than four handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>that the principle of <span class="gemarra-italic">lavud</span> applies; all the side posts are considered a single side post. <span class="gemarra-regular">He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may </span>therefore only <span class="gemarra-regular">utilize </span>the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">up to the inner</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> edge of the innermost side post, </span>but no more. However, according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not say </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-italic">lavud</span> applies unless the gap is less than three handbreadths, he <span class="gemarra-regular">may utilize </span>the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">up to the inner edge of the outermost </span>side post. This discussion demonstrates that the argument revolves around the question as to which side post establishes the permitted area. <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> with regard to the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the side posts, all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> agree </span>that carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava </span>answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> too, </span>it refers to a case where the alleyway’s entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">opens to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the entrance opens <span class="gemarra-regular">to a public domain, what </span>is its legal status – would carrying be <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted? </span>If so, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> is more severe than that of a public domain. Once again, this can be likened to a situation where <span class="gemarra-regular">a permanent resident is </span>down <span class="gemarra-regular">on the ground, while a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stranger </span>is raised up <span class="gemarra-regular">to the highest heaven. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>indeed, this is the ruling, but one should not be perplexed, as we have explained: <span class="gemarra-regular">it has found</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its own type and been awakened. </span>

Daf 9b

The Gemara provides an alternative explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, carrying in the area between the side posts is actually permitted. The dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis concerning the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span> is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>there was an alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">that one lined with side posts, each </span>positioned <span class="gemarra-regular">less than four </span>handbreadths from the next, and the side posts extend <span class="gemarra-regular">for a length of four cubits.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">According to Rabban Shimon ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gamliel, who said </span>that for a gap of up to four handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>that the principle of <span class="gemarra-italic">lavud</span> applies, all the side posts are considered a single side post, and since the side post in that case is four cubits long, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered a separate <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway; </span>therefore, it <span class="gemarra-regular">requires an additional side post to permit </span>carrying in <span class="gemarra-regular">it. And according to the Rabbis, who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do not say </span>that the principle of <span class="gemarra-italic">lavud</span> applies unless the gap is less than three handbreadths, this area <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not require an additional side post to permit </span>carrying within it.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon ben Gamliel, </span>why is another side post required? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>have the same legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>a side post that is <span class="gemarra-regular">visible from the outside, </span>protruding from the wall of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">from the inside. </span>Since it is evident from the outside that it is a side post and not part of the building, carrying is permitted there.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>Rav Ashi’s <span class="gemarra-regular">reason is only according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan, when Ravin came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t </span>he say that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>If a side post is <span class="gemarra-regular">visible from the outside</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>protruding from the wall of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>it appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">from the inside</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not considered </span>to have the legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a side post?</span>
An amoraic dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated: </span>If a side post is <span class="gemarra-regular">visible from the inside</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>protruding from the wall of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>it appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">from the outside</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered a side post</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> However, if a side post is <span class="gemarra-regular">visible from the outside </span>protruding from the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>it appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">from the inside, </span>there is a disagreement between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, with regard to its status. <span class="gemarra-regular">One said: It is considered </span>to have the legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">of a side post. And </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one said: It is not considered </span>to have the legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">of a side post. </span>
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude that Rabbi Ḥiyya </span>is the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is considered </span>to have the legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">of a side post, as Rabbi Ḥiyya </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a wall </span>at the entrance to an alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">whose one side is more recessed than </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the other, whether </span>the recess <span class="gemarra-regular">is visible from outside </span>the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">even from the inside, or </span>the recess <span class="gemarra-regular">is visible from the inside but </span>appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">even from the outside, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered </span>to have the legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">of a side post. </span>The Gemara states: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude </span>that Rabbi Ḥiyya is the one who said it has the legal status of a side post. 
The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>who explicitly said that a side post of that kind is not considered a side post, <span class="gemarra-regular">did he not hear this</span> <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> was widely known. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, he heard it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but he does not hold </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">it. </span>Perhaps, then, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya also does not hold </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">it. </span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is this </span>comparison? <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, Rabbi Yoḥanan does not hold </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">That is why he did not teach it. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabbi Ḥiyya, if it is </span>true <span class="gemarra-regular">that he does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not hold </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">it, why would he teach </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna said: </span>If a side post is <span class="gemarra-regular">visible from the outside, </span>protruding from the wall of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the inside, it is considered </span>to have the legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">of a side post. Rabba said: And we raise </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an objection to our </span>own <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> from a mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a small courtyard that was breached </span>along the entire length of one of its walls so that it opens <span class="gemarra-regular">into a large </span>courtyard, in <span class="gemarra-regular">the large one </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the small one </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>to carry. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the breach <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> considered an entrance of the large </span>courtyard. The wall of the smaller courtyard was breached along its entire length, therefore there is no visible partition from inside the smaller courtyard. However, the partition is noticeable from the outside, i.e., in the large courtyard, since the breach is flanked on both sides by the remaining segments of the wall of the large courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is so, </span>that a partition that is visible from the outside is considered a partition, carrying in <span class="gemarra-regular">the small </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">should also be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted </span>in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">is visible </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from the outside but </span>appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">even from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inside.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: </span>This mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the walls of the small </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">protrude into the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">large one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the breached wall of the small courtyard is not in line with the wall of the large one. Therefore, even when viewed from the outside there are no walls visible, and that is why carrying is prohibited there.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">let us say </span>that the principle of <span class="gemarra-italic">lavu</span><span class="gemarra-italic">d</span> applies, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">will be permitted </span>even in the small courtyard. The ends of the breached wall should be considered attached to the side walls of the large courtyard, rendering the wall of the large courtyard visible. Then it will be permitted to carry in the small courtyard based on the principle governing side posts visible from the outside. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say that </span>the walls of the smaller courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">are too separate </span>from the walls of the larger courtyard, such that the distance between the walls is too great for the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span> to apply, <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t Rav Adda bar Avimi teach before Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanina: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>courtyard of which they speak is referring even <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">ten cubits </span>wide; the <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>one is referring even <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">eleven </span>cubits wide? Apparently, this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies even when the difference in width between the courtyards is a single cubit, which is six handbreadths. Assuming the small courtyard is located equidistant from the ends of the large courtyard, only three handbreadths separate it on each side from the wall of the large one. Therefore, the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span> applies.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the walls of the smaller courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">are separated from this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wall </span>of the larger courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">by two </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">and from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this wall </span>of the larger courtyard on the other side <span class="gemarra-regular">by four </span>handbreadths. Since there is a distance of more than three handbreadths, the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span> does not apply.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let us say </span>that the principle of <span class="gemarra-italic">lavud</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">from one direction</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span>then carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">will be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted </span>even in the small courtyard. 

Daf 10a

The Gemara answers: This mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">who said </span>that in order to permit carrying in a courtyard that was breached, <span class="gemarra-regular">we require two </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards, </span>one on either side of the breach. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard </span>was breached and opens into the public domain, and the width of the breach does not exceed ten cubits, it <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes permitted </span>to carry there, even <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">board </span>remaining on one side of the breach. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>It is permitted only <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards </span>remaining, one on each side of the breach.
The Gemara rejects this entire explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is this </span>comparison? <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that the legal status of a side post that is <span class="gemarra-regular">visible from the outside but </span>appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">from the inside is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not considered </span>like that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post; and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei </span>that a side post or an upright board in a courtyard must be at least three handbreadths wide; <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>the explanations of the mishna offered earlier by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira and Ravina are not </span>accepted; <span class="gemarra-regular">that is why</span> there is significance to the fact that the <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>courtyard is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits wide and the <span class="gemarra-regular">large one is eleven</span> cubits wide. It is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span> Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosei. </span>Since Rabbi Yosei holds that a side post must be three handbreadths wide, we require that the two upright boards together measure six handbreadths, i.e., one cubit, which is the minimal difference in size between the two courtyards.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, if you say </span>that the legal status of a side post that is <span class="gemarra-regular">visible from the outside</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inside is considered </span>like that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post; and</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira’s and Ravina’s </span>explanations <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>accepted as <span class="it-text">halakha</span>; and that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">does not hold</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, why do I</span> need to explain that the <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>courtyard measures <span class="gemarra-regular">eleven </span>cubits? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Whichever way </span>you look at it, there is a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is coming</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to permit </span>one to carry in <span class="gemarra-regular">the large </span>courtyard, then a width <span class="gemarra-regular">of ten </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">and two handbreadths suffices. </span>These two handbreadths can be considered the upright boards that render the courtyard fit for one to carry within it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is coming to </span>teach a novel <span class="it-text">halakha</span> according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibit </span>one to carry in <span class="gemarra-regular">the small </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">it should teach us </span>a case where the walls of the two courtyards are much <span class="gemarra-regular">farther </span><span class="gemarra-regular">removed </span>from each other, rather than a case where they are only one cubit apart. Therefore, the second explanation cannot be accepted.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, can we not conclude from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that a side post that is <span class="gemarra-regular">visible from the outside but </span>appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">from the inside is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not considered </span>to have the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a side</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> post? </span>The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from this. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: I did not hear this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of Rabba bar Rav Huna from my teachers. Rav Yosef had become ill and forgotten his learning, which is why he could not recall the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that a side post that is visible from the outside is considered to have the legal status of a side post. 
His student <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: You </span>yourself <span class="gemarra-regular">told</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you told </span>it to <span class="gemarra-regular">us. As Rami bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">side post that extends along the wall of an alleyway </span>and beyond, in which case it appears from the inside to be a continuation of the wall but due to its narrow width it is clearly visible as a side post from the outside, if that side post is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than four cubits </span>long <span class="gemarra-regular">it is considered </span>to have the legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">of a side post. And one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> use </span>the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">up to the inner edge </span>of the side post. However, if the side post itself extends <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits, </span>the alleyway has no side post and <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is considered to </span>have the legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">of an alleyway, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and it is prohibited to utilize the entire </span>alleyway.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you said to us about this: Learn from this </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span> with regard to <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from it </span>that in the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the side posts it is prohibited</span> to carry, as Rav Huna rules that one may use the alleyway only up to the inner edge of the side post. <span class="gemarra-regular">And learn from it </span>that the minimal <span class="gemarra-regular">length</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of an alleyway is four </span>cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">And learn from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>that a side post that is <span class="gemarra-regular">visible from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">outside but </span>appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with the wall of the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">from the inside is considered </span>to have the legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">of a side post.</span>
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that a side post that is <span class="gemarra-regular">visible from the outside but </span>appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">from the inside is considered</span> to have the legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">of a side post. </span>The Gemara asks: It is possible that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> conclusive refutation </span>of this opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is also <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>This opinion was refuted earlier. Can the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> then be decided in accordance with it? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>it can <span class="gemarra-regular">because Rabbi Ḥiyya taught </span>a <span class="it-text">barait</span><span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with it. </span>Although the deductive analysis of the statements of other <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> led to different conclusions, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> relies on Rabbi Ḥiyya’s explicit statement. 
The opening mishna states: If the entrance to an alleyway is <span class="gemarra-regular">wider than ten </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">one must diminish </span>its width. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>that a Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: If the entrance to an alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">is wider than ten </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">one must diminish </span>its width. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> need not diminish it. </span>The question arises: <span class="gemarra-regular">Until what </span>width does Rabbi Yehuda still permit carrying in the alleyway?
Initially, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥai thought to say before Rav Yosef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Up to thirteen and a third cubits. And </span>he derived this figure through <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> argument <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> surrounding a well. </span>Rabbi Yehuda maintains that if one placed upright boards up to thirteen and a third cubits apart from one another, he may consider the partitioned area around the well as a private domain and therefore carry within it. 
Rav Aḥai explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>in the case of upright <span class="gemarra-regular">board</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> surrounding a well, where you permitted </span>carrying, even though the boards form a partition where the <span class="gemarra-regular">breached </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than the standing </span>segment, <span class="gemarra-regular">you did not permit </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">within them </span>if the gap between the boards is <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than thirteen and a third cubits </span>wide; in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway, where you did not permit </span>carrying if the <span class="gemarra-regular">breached </span>segment of its walls <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">standing </span>segment, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not right that you will not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permit </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">within it </span>if there is a gap <span class="gemarra-regular">more</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than thirteen and a third cubits </span>wide?
<span class="gemarra-regular">But that </span>reasoning <span class="gemarra-regular">provides </span>support for a contrary conclusion as well. Just as in the case of upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards surrounding a well, where you permitted </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them, </span>even though the boards form a partition where the <span class="gemarra-regular">breached </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than the standing </span>segment, <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will not </span>extend the leniency and <span class="gemarra-regular">permit </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">within them,</span> when the gap between the boards is <span class="gemarra-regular">more than thirteen</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a third cubits; </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway, where you</span> were stringent and <span class="gemarra-regular">did not permit </span>carrying when the <span class="gemarra-regular">breached</span> segment <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than the standing </span>segment, in a case where most of the walls are standing, <span class="gemarra-regular">you will </span>certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">permit </span>carrying, even when the gap is <span class="gemarra-regular">more than </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thirteen and a third cubits.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>one may argue <span class="gemarra-regular">to the contrary. </span>One should be more stringent in the case of an alleyway. In the case of upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards surrounding a well, with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which you were lenient </span>and issued <span class="gemarra-regular">one leniency, be lenient</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>issue <span class="gemarra-regular">another leniency </span>and maintain that a gap of up to thirteen and a third cubits still be considered an entrance. However, in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway, </span>you should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be lenient <span class="gemarra-regular">at all</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, there is no way to determine Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion with regard to the width of an alleyway entrance. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Levi taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to reducing the width of an alleyway in order to render it fit for one to carry within it. If <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is twenty cubits wide, one may stick a reed in</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">center </span>of its entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">sufficient </span>to create two separate alleyways, each ten cubits wide. <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he said </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">it that the</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in accordance with that teaching, </span>as the insertion of a reed is not effective in reducing the width. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said in the name of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Levi: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in accordance with that teaching</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, how should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one act </span>in order to render an alleyway of that sort fit for one to carry within it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the name of Levi: </span>

Daf 10b

<span class="gemarra-regular">One prepares a board ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high with a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> length of four cubits and stands it lengthwise </span>down the middle <span class="gemarra-regular">of the alleyway, </span>and thereby forms two small alleyways at the entrance to the alleyway, neither of which is more than ten cubits wide.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>one can act <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway is fifteen cubits wide, </span>how does one reduce its width? <span class="gemarra-regular">He distances </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">two cubits </span>from one of the walls of the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">and prepares a board three</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits </span>wide, thereby leaving an opening of only ten cubits.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why </span>must one reduce the width in this manner? <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>could also <span class="gemarra-regular">prepare</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a board a cubit and a hal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f</span> wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> distance </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">two cubits, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">prepare </span>another board <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubit and a half </span>wide, leaving the alleyway with an opening of only ten cubits. Apparently, one may <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact that Rav Yehuda did not suggest <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>possibility that if the <span class="gemarra-regular">standing </span>segment of a wall is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than the breached </span>segment only when one combines the standing segments <span class="gemarra-regular">from two directions, </span>i.e., both sides of the breach, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not considered </span>as though the <span class="gemarra-regular">standing </span>segment were greater. 
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, I would say to you </span>that ordinarily <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is considered </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">standing </span>even when one must combine the standing segments on the two sides of the breach. <span class="gemarra-regular">However</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is different here, as the air, </span>i.e., the one and a half cubit opening, <span class="gemarra-regular">of this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">side</span> of the far board <span class="gemarra-regular">and the air, </span>i.e., the ten cubit opening, <span class="gemarra-regular">of this </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">side </span>of the board <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">and negate it. </span>Therefore, in this case, the board that is farther from the wall cannot serve to close off the alleyway.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one </span>could instead <span class="gemarra-regular">prepare a board </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit </span>wide <span class="gemarra-regular">and distance </span>himself one <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit, and prepare </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">board </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cubit and distance </span>himself one <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit, and prepare </span>a third <span class="gemarra-regular">board </span>of one <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit, </span>thus ensuring that the open space is not greater than the standing segment on both sides. Apparently, since Rav Yehuda did not suggest this possibility, one may <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from this </span>that if the <span class="gemarra-regular">standing</span> segment of a wall <span class="gemarra-regular">is equal to the breached </span>segment, carrying in the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited. </span>
The Gemara rejects this assumption: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I would say to you </span>that ordinarily carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>in that case. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here it is different, since the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">air, </span>the opening, <span class="gemarra-regular">on this side </span>of the board <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the air, </span>the opening, <span class="gemarra-regular">on that side </span>of the board <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">and negate </span>the effectiveness of the board.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one could <span class="gemarra-regular">distance </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">one cubit </span>from the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">and prepare </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a board </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cubit and a half, and distance </span>himself another <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit, and prepare </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">board </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cubit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and a half. </span>In this manner, one could diminish the width of the entrance of the alleyway to ten cubits.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is indeed so; </span>this would work equally as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages did not burden him this much, </span>requiring him to prepare two boards where one suffices.
The Gemara raises a new issue: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us be concerned lest one abandon </span>use of <span class="gemarra-regular">the larger </span><span class="gemarra-regular">entrance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is ten cubits wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>begin to <span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span>the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">through the smaller entrance, </span>which has a width of two cubits. This would negate the larger opening’s status as an entrance and render the alleyway unfit for one to carry within it, as it would no longer have an entrance with a side post. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Mattana said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>is that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not abandon a larger entrance and enter </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">through a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> smaller entrance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way is this <span class="gemarra-regular">different </span>from the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Am</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi Asi, </span>who maintain that in the case of an alleyway that is breached on its side wall close to its entrance, if the breach is large enough for one to enter through it, carrying in the alleyway is prohibited? There, too, such a breach should not be problematic, as a person does not abandon a larger entrance to enter through a smaller one.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, the smaller entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">reduces </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">walking </span>distance. If one approaches the alleyway from the side, the smaller entrance provides a shortcut, and therefore one might enter through it as well. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of the two entrances one two cubits and one ten cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">it does not reduce </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">walking </span>distance, as both openings are situated at the front of the alleyway. 
The Gemara returns to the issue of the standing segment that is greater than the breached segment. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in tractate <span class="it-text">Kelim</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The leather </span>covering <span class="gemarra-regular">of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stool </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">asla</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">and its hole join </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>complete <span class="gemarra-regular">a handbreadth </span>with regard to ritual impurity imparted by a tent over a corpse. Any person, vessel, or food that is beneath a covering that is at least a handbreadth in size together with a portion of a corpse of at least an olive-bulk becomes ritually impure with impurity imparted by a corpse. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that the leather covering of a stool and its hole combine to complete the measure of a handbreadth. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the leather </span>covering <span class="gemarra-regular">of a stool </span>referred to in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Ḥana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yoḥanan said: The leather covering</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a bathroom. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how large </span>can the hole be and still combine with the leather covering to complete the handbreadth? <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: Two fingers </span>of leather <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here, </span>on one side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and two fingers </span>of leather <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>on the other side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a space </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of two fingers </span>for the hole <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">when Ravin came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">A finger and a half </span>of leather <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a finger and a half </span>on the leather <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and a space of </span>a single <span class="gemarra-regular">finger </span>for the hole <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Dimi: Do </span>the two of <span class="gemarra-regular">you, </span>yourself and Ravin, <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree </span>in principle? Rav Dimi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: No, </span>rather <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>Ravin’s statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">is referring to the large </span>finger, i.e., the thumb, and <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>my own statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">referring to the small </span>finger, the pinkie, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not disagree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Both were describing one handbreadth, which equals the width of four thumbs or six pinkies.
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not so </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">la’ei</span>]. <span class="gemarra-regular">You disagree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and you disagree with regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case where the <span class="gemarra-regular">standing </span>segment of a wall is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than the breached </span>segment only when one combines the standing segments <span class="gemarra-regular">from two directions, </span>i.e., both sides of the breached segment. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to you, </span>this wall <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> standing, </span>even when one must combine the standing segments <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two directions. According to Ravin, </span>if the standing segment <span class="gemarra-regular">on one side </span>of the breach is greater, the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered as standing; </span>however, if the standing segment is greater only after combining the standing segments <span class="gemarra-regular">from the two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">directions, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not considered as standing. </span>
Abaye continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">For if it should enter your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mind </span>to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">you do not disagree, </span>but simply refer to the same measures by different names, <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>express his opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravin should have said as follows: A finger </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and a third </span>of leather <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, and a finger </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and a third </span>of leather <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, and </span>a space of <span class="gemarra-regular">a finger and a third </span>for the hole <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the middle. </span>In this case, there would still be a handbreadth in total, but each side of leather alone would not be larger than the space in the middle. The fact that Ravin presented a case where the hole in the middle is smaller than the width of the leather on either side indicates that his dispute with Rav Dimi is a fundamental one.
Rav Dimi responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>do you wish to say, that <span class="gemarra-regular">we disagree? </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>express the opinion attributed to <span class="gemarra-regular">me, I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should have said as follows: A finger and two thirds</span> of leather <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, and a finger and two thirds</span> of leather <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, and a space of two fingers</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and two thirds in the middle. </span>This would provide a more striking case where, despite the fact that the breach is much greater than the standing segments on either of its sides, the two standing segments combine together so that the standing segments are considered greater than the breached segment. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if there is </span>room <span class="gemarra-regular">to say that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we disagree, </span>our dispute relates to a different point, and <span class="gemarra-regular">we argue </span>in the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the breached </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">equal to the standing </span>segment on each side. According to Ravin, it is considered breached; while according to Rav Dimi, it is considered standing.
The Gemara returns to the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the entrance to the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>an opening in the <span class="gemarra-regular">form of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> doorway, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if it is wider than ten </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">one need not diminish </span>its width. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">We find </span>that an opening in the <span class="gemarra-regular">form of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">doorwa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is effective </span>to permit carrying in an alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span> regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">its width, </span>i.e., when its entrance is more than ten cubits wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a cornice </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is effective with </span>regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">its height, </span>i.e., when it is more than twenty cubits high. 

Daf 11a

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">the opposite </span>situation? Does an opening in the form of a doorway also serve to permit carrying in an alleyway that is more than twenty cubits high?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the answer to this question, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If the cross beam placed over the entrance to <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway is higher than twenty cubits, one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must diminish </span>its height, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if </span>the entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">has an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> opening in the form of a doorway, he need not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> diminish it.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the effect of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cornice with </span>regard to the need to diminish the alleyway’s <span class="gemarra-regular">width</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Does the cornice render the alleyway fit for one to carry within it, even if the entrance is more than ten cubits wide? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>an answer <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If the cross beam placed over the entrance to <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway is higher than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> twenty cubits, one must diminish </span>its height, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>if the alleyway is <span class="gemarra-regular">wider than ten </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">one must diminish </span>its width. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if </span>the entrance to the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">has an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> opening in the form of a doorway, he need not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> diminish it, and, </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">if it has a cornice, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> need not diminish it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara explains the proof it wishes to adduce from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is </span>this statement with regard to the cornice <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the latter </span>clause, i.e., the case of an alleyway that is wider than ten cubits, proving that a cornice can render an alleyway otherwise too wide fit for one to carry within it? The Gemara refutes this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this statement is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first </span>clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that a cornice is effective for an alleyway more than twenty cubits high, but it tells us nothing about one that is more than ten cubits wide.
With regard to the same issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda would teach </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥiyya bar Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Rav </span>as follows: If the entrance to an alleyway that is wider than ten cubits has an opening in the form of a doorway, <span class="gemarra-regular">he need not diminish </span>its width. Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Teach him </span>that the correct version of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is: <span class="gemarra-regular">He must diminish </span>its width.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: From the statement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of our teacher, </span>Rav, who said that the entrance to an alleyway must be diminished even if it has an opening in the form of a doorway, <span class="gemarra-regular">we will learn </span>that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard, </span>the walls of <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are mostly entrances and windows, it is not permitted </span>to carry within it even <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>having an opening in <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">form of a doorway. </span>Even if the entrances have an opening in the form of a doorway, this does not render a mostly breached courtyard wall into a closed wall. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? Since </span>an opening of <span class="gemarra-regular">more than ten </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">renders it prohibited </span>for one to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">in an alleyway, and </span>likewise when the <span class="gemarra-regular">breached </span>segment of a wall that <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its standing </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">renders it prohibited </span>for one to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">in a courtyard, </span>the following claim can be made: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as, </span>according to Rav, in the case of an opening <span class="gemarra-regular">more than ten </span>cubits wide <span class="gemarra-regular">that renders it prohibited </span>for one to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">in an alleyway, </span>carrying in the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">is not permitted by the form of a doorway </span>in the opening, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>too a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">breached </span>segment of a wall <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than its standing </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">that renders </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it prohibited </span>for one to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">in a courtyard, </span>carrying in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">is not permitted by the form of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a doorway </span>in the opening.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the basis for comparison to an opening that is <span class="gemarra-regular">more than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ten </span>cubits wide <span class="gemarra-regular">that renders it prohibited </span>for one to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">in an alleyway? </span>It is not permitted by having an opening in the form of a doorway <span class="gemarra-regular">because you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not permit </span>an opening of that size <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the case of upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards surrounding a well, in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir. </span>Can <span class="gemarra-regular">you say</span> the same <span class="gemarra-regular">in a </span>case where the <span class="gemarra-regular">breached </span>segment of a wall is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than the standing </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">that renders</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it prohibited </span>for one to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">in a courtyard, </span>that carrying in the courtyard will not be permitted by the form of a doorway? That situation is clearly not as severe a problem, <span class="gemarra-regular">as you permitted </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span> upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards surrounding a well according to everyone. </span>Consequently, no comparison can be made between the case of an opening wider than ten cubits in an alleyway and a partition in which the breached segment is greater than the standing segment in a courtyard. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">supports</span> this opinion that the form of a doorway is ineffective in a case where the breached segments of a wall are greater than its standing segments: With regard to the area enclosed by <span class="gemarra-regular">these walls that most of them </span>consist of <span class="gemarra-regular">entrances and windows, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to carry on Shabbat therein, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that the standing </span>segments <span class="gemarra-regular">are greater than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the breached </span>segments.
The Gemara first analyzes the wording of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The Gemara analyzes the formulation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Can</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it enter your mind that </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where most of </span>the walls are entrances and windows? If so, the standing segments are not greater than the breached segments. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>emend the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Carrying in the area enclosed by these walls <span class="gemarra-regular">to which he added</span> many <span class="gemarra-regular">entrances and windows is permitted, provided that the standing</span> segments <span class="gemarra-regular">are greater than the breached </span>segments. Apparently, if the breached segments are greater than the standing segments, carrying is not permitted even if the breaches are in the form of doorways.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana said </span>that his is not an absolute proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">When this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught, </span>it was taught <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to broken entrances </span>[<span class="it-text">pitḥei</span> <span class="it-text">shima’ei</span>] that lack the proper form of doorways. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are broken entrances? Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Reḥumei and Rav Yosef disagreed </span>on the matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">One said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that they do not have </span>proper <span class="gemarra-regular">doorposts, and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one said that they do not have lintels </span>above the openings.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And even Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav, </span>that an opening in the form of a doorway does not permit carrying if the opening is more than ten cubits wide. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Ravin bar Rav Adda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving a person from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> valley of Beit Ḥortan who stuck four poles </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">kunddeisin</span>] into the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">in the four corner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">field, and stretched a vine over them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> creating the form of a doorway on each side. He intended to seal the area so that he would be permitted to plant a vineyard in close proximity without creating a forbidden mixture of diverse kinds in a vineyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the case</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> came before the Sages, and they permitted him </span>to consider it sealed <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to diverse kinds. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Reish Lakish said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Just as they permitted him </span>to consider it sealed <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to diverse kinds, so </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">they permitted him </span>to consider it sealed <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to Shabbat, </span>i.e., they permitted carrying within this area. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: With </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to diverse kinds, they permitted him </span>to consider it sealed, however, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to Shabbat, they did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permit him </span>to do so.
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we dealing </span>here? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that he draped the vines on the posts <span class="gemarra-regular">from the side, </span>rather than on top of them, <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t Rav Ḥisda say </span>with regard to Shabbat: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one constructed </span>an opening in <span class="gemarra-regular">the form </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a doorway from the side</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he has done </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nothing?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that he set the vines <span class="gemarra-regular">on top of </span>the posts. <span class="gemarra-regular">And in what </span>circumstances did Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish disagree? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that the posts were set at a distance <span class="gemarra-regular">of ten </span>cubits from each other, <span class="gemarra-regular">would Rabbi Yoḥanan say in that </span>case that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to Shabbat, </span>they did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permit him to consider the area sealed? Everyone agrees that the form of a doorway is effective for an entrance that is only ten cubits wide.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, isn’t</span> it referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the posts were <span class="gemarra-regular">more</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than ten </span>cubits apart? Apparently, Rabbi Yoḥanan agrees with Rav, that an opening in the form of a doorway does not permit carrying if the original opening is wider than ten cubits.
The Gemara refutes this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">No</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, actually </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the posts were <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits apart, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the person attached the vines to the posts <span class="gemarra-regular">from the side. And </span>Reish Lakish and Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda. </span>Reish Lakish maintains that the form of a doorway is effective even when the horizontal cross beam is attached to the vertical posts from the side, and Rabbi Yoḥanan agrees with Rav Ḥisda that a form of a doorway is ineffective for the purpose of carrying on Shabbat when constructed in such a manner.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>it is possible to <span class="gemarra-regular">raise a contradiction </span>between this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan and </span>another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan; and </span>it is possible to <span class="gemarra-regular">raise a contradiction </span>between this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Reish Lakish and </span>another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Reish Lakish. As Reish Lakish said in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the name of Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥanina: </span>

Daf 11b

<span class="gemarra-regular">A braid </span>of vines plaited around poles to form a partition <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to diverse kinds, </span>i.e., it is considered a partition that renders planting grapevines in close proximity to other crops permitted, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not with regard to Shabbat. And Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan said: Just as </span>such a braid is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered a <span class="gemarra-regular">partition with regard to Shabbat, so </span>too it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a partition with regard to diverse kinds. </span>Their opinions in the dispute here apparently contradict their opinions in the dispute cited above. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>the apparent contradiction between one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Reish Lakish </span>and the other statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Reish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lakish </span>poses <span class="gemarra-regular">no difficulty, as this </span>statement, according to which such a braid of vines is an effective partition even with regard to Shabbat, reflects <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>own opinion; <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>statement, according to which it is an effective partition only with regard to diverse kinds, reflects the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of his teacher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥanina. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>the apparent contradiction between one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan and </span>the other statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>where Rabbi Yoḥanan ruled that a braid of vines is an effective partition with regard to diverse kinds, it is referring to a case where the vines were placed <span class="gemarra-regular">on top of </span>the posts, while <span class="gemarra-regular">here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>where he rules that it is ineffective even with regard to diverse kinds, it is referring to a case where they were attached to the posts <span class="gemarra-regular">from the side, </span>it works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well. However, if you say </span>that both <span class="gemarra-regular">this and that </span>are cases where the vines were attached <span class="gemarra-regular">from the side, what is there to say? </span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">this and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>are cases where the vines were attached to the side posts <span class="gemarra-regular">from the side. There, </span>where Rabbi Yoḥanan ruled that the braid is an effective partition with regard to diverse kinds, it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the poles were only <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits apart; <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>where he rules that it is ineffective even with regard to diverse kinds, it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the poles were <span class="gemarra-regular">more than ten </span>cubits apart.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And from where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do you say that we distinguish between </span>an opening of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>an opening of <span class="gemarra-regular">more than ten </span>cubits? <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Reish Lakish: That is not</span> the way that <span class="gemarra-regular">the incident </span>transpired. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Yehoshua </span><span class="gemarra-regular">went to Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri to study Torah, even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">though </span>Rabbi Yehoshua himself was an <span class="gemarra-regular">exper</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakhot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of diverse kinds and found him sitting among the trees</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">stretched a vine from one tree to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> another and said to him: Rabbi, if there are grapevines</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here, </span>in the enclosed area, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">sowing </span>diverse kinds of seeds <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>on the other side of the partition? Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the trees are only <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits apart, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted; </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">more than ten </span>cubits apart, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited.</span>
The Gemara clarifies the case: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing </span>here? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the vines were placed <span class="gemarra-regular">on top of </span>the trees, when they are <span class="gemarra-regular">more than ten </span>cubits apart <span class="gemarra-regular">is it prohibited? But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to diverse kinds: <span class="gemarra-regular">If there were forked </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reeds there and he plaited a braid </span>of vines <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the reeds were set <span class="gemarra-regular">more than </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits apart, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted? </span>With regard to diverse kinds, the form of a doorway when properly constructed is certainly effective.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>referring to a case where he attached the vines to the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> side, and he is saying to him: In </span>a case where the trees are only <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits apart, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted; </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where the trees are <span class="gemarra-regular">more than ten </span>cubits apart, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited? </span>The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from it </span>that there is a distinction between poles that are ten cubits apart and poles that are more than ten cubits apart, and that this distinction resolves the contradiction between the two statements of Rabbi Yoḥanan.
The Gemara now examines <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter itself </span>with regard to Rav Ḥisda’s statement cited above. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one prepared </span>an opening in <span class="gemarra-regular">the form of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a doorway from the side, </span>placing the horizontal cross beam to the sides, rather than on top, of the vertical posts, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not done anything</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥisda </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said: The </span>opening in the <span class="gemarra-regular">form of a doorway </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of which </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">spoke must be strong enough to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mount a door in it, and even </span>if it is merely a flimsy <span class="gemarra-regular">door of straw</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said in the name of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yannai: The </span>opening in the <span class="gemarra-regular">form of a doorway requires</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a mark </span>in the doorpost <span class="gemarra-regular">for hinges. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is an mark for hinges? Rav Avya said: Loop</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s </span><span class="gemarra-regular CharOverride-1">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">avkata</span><span class="gemarra-regular CharOverride-1">]</span> into which the hinge is inserted, so that it will be possible to mount a door in the doorway.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, the son of Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Avya, </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">found the students of Rav Ashi </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to them: Did the Master, </span>Rav Ashi, <span class="gemarra-regular">say anything with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to </span>an opening in <span class="gemarra-regular">the form of a doorway? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: He said nothing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> implying that an indication for hinges is unnecessary. 
A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> form of a doorway of which they spoke </span>consists of <span class="gemarra-regular">a reed from here, </span>on one side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reed from there, </span>on the opposite side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a reed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on top of them. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Need </span>the lower reeds reach high enough <span class="gemarra-regular">to touch </span>the upper reed, <span class="gemarra-regular">or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do they not need to touch </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: They do not need to touch </span>it; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sheshet said: They need to touch </span>it. 
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman went </span>ahead <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> performed an action in the house of the Exilarch in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">opinion. </span>He constructed an opening in the form of a doorway such that the upper reed was not in contact with the lower reeds. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to his attendant, Rav Gadda: Go, remove </span>those reeds and <span class="gemarra-regular">throw them </span>away. The attendant <span class="gemarra-regular">went, removed </span>the reeds, and <span class="gemarra-regular">threw them </span>away. Members <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Exilarch’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> court found hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">imprisoned him </span>for destroying the form of a doorway that permitted them to carry. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sheshet went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">stood at the door </span>of the prison, and <span class="gemarra-regular">called </span>out <span class="gemarra-regular">to him: Gadda, go out </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">come</span> to me. The Exilarch’s men released him, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> went out and came </span>to Rav Sheshet.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">found</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabba bar Shmuel </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Did the Master</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teach anything with regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">the form</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a doorway? He said to him: Yes, we learned</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an arched gateway</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir deems </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated to </span>affix <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the Rabbis deem </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt. However, they </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">agree that if its supports, </span>the vertical sides of the gate before it arches, <span class="gemarra-regular">are ten </span>handbreadths high, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the gate <span class="gemarra-regular">requires </span>a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>.
In order to explain the dispute, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Everyone agrees that if </span>the entire arch <span class="gemarra-regular">is ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high, but its supports are less than three </span>handbreadths high, or, <span class="gemarra-regular">alternatively, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">its supports are three </span>handbreadths high but the entire arch <span class="gemarra-regular">is less than ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the arch requires <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span><span class="it-text">mezuza</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">at all. </span>Both of these gateways lack the requisite parameters of the form of a doorway to require a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Where they disagree is in</span> a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the supports are three </span>handbreadths high <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> the entire arch is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high, </span>and at the height of ten handbreadths the arch <span class="gemarra-regular">is less than four</span> handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide; however, there is </span>room <span class="gemarra-regular">to carve out </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">to complete it to four </span>handbreadths, so that the opening of the arch measures four handbreadths wide and ten handbreadths high. 
Abaye explains the dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one carves </span>out the area <span class="gemarra-regular">to complete </span>the four handbreadths, i.e., the arch is considered as though it has already been carved out, and the opening has the necessary dimensions. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not carve</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out </span>the arch <span class="gemarra-regular">to complete </span>the four handbreadths. Since the opening is not actually four handbreadths wide at a height of ten handbreadths, no <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> need be affixed. Rabba bar Shmuel indicates that everyone agrees that the lintel need not touch the doorposts of the entrance; if the arch’s opening were four handbreadths wide at a height of ten handbreadths, it would require a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> even though the ceiling is separated by the arch and does not touch the doorposts directly. So too, with regard to the form of a doorway, the upper reed need not touch the lower reeds, contrary to the opinion of Rav Sheshet. 
Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Rabba bar Shmuel: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you find them, do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the members of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Exilarch’s household anything </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of an arched gateway, </span>as it is proof against my opinion.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There is a basic dispute with regard to the method of <span class="gemarra-regular">rendering an alleyway fit </span>for one to carry within it on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>Both <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post and a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>are required. <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel say: Either a side post or a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam. Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>Two <span class="gemarra-regular">side posts </span>are required, one on each side of the alleyway. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">In the name of Rabbi Yishmael, one student said before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Akiva: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> about an alleyway that is less than four cubits </span>wide, as they both agree <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">is rendered permitted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by either a side post or a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam. With </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to what did they disagree? It is with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>an alleyway that is <span class="gemarra-regular">wider than four cubits, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">up to ten </span>cubits wide; <span class="gemarra-regular">as Beit Shammai say: </span>It requires both <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post and a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam. And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Beit Hillel say: </span>It requires <span class="gemarra-regular">either a side post or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam. Rabbi Akiva said </span>to the disciple: It is not so, as <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">about this </span>case, i.e., an alleyway that is less than four cubits wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">and about that </span>case, i.e., an alleyway that is between four and ten cubits wide. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Before clarifying the various opinions in the mishna, the Gemara seeks to determine: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion was this mishna taught? Apparently, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">neither in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya, nor in accordance with </span>the unattributed opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, who disagree about an alleyway that is open to a public domain on two opposite sides. The dispute is whether the form of a doorway on one end and a side post and a cross beam on the other end suffice to render it permitted for one to carry within it, or whether actual doors are required, at least on one end. However, they both agree that a side post and a cross beam alone are not effective. Since at this point the Gemara assumes that the dispute in the mishna between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel applies to all alleyways, whether closed on one side or open on two opposite sides to the public domain, these opinions reflect an entirely different position.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: How is a closed alleyway </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rendered fit </span>for one to carry within it on Shabbat? <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: </span>It requires both <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam. And Beit Hillel say: Either a side </span><span class="gemarra-regular">post or a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam.</span>
The Gemara discusses the basis of each opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: </span>It requires both <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam. Is that to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shammai hold </span>that in order for an area to be considered a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">four partitions are </span>required <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> law? </span>Since a side post with a cross beam qualifies as a partition, the fact that they do not permit carrying within an alleyway without a side post indicates that they maintain that a private domain requires four partitions.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>there is no proof, as one cannot conclude the parameters for a private domain based on the number of walls required to permit carrying. As with regard to the Torah prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> throw </span>an object into a private domain from the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">once </span>an enclosed area has <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>partitions, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>by Torah law. However, to permit one <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">carry </span>an object within a private domain, the Rabbis decreed that it is not permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">until there are </span>partitions on all <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>sides. 
The Gemara attempts to draw an inference from that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: Either a side post or a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>is required. <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel hold that</span> at least <span class="gemarra-regular">three partitions </span>are required <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law, </span>and that an area with fewer is not considered a private domain?
The Gemara rejects this argument as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">No </span>proof can be cited from here. With regard to the Torah prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">to throw </span>an object into a private domain from the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">once </span>an enclosed area has merely <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>partitions, <span class="gemarra-regular">one is liable </span>by Torah law. However, to permit one <span class="gemarra-regular">to carry </span>an object within a private domain, the Rabbis decreed that it is not permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">until there are </span>partitions on <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>sides. A cross beam and a side post do not function as partitions but merely as conspicuous markers, so that one does not mistakenly carry outside the alleyway.
We learned in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>Two <span class="gemarra-regular">side posts </span>are required. A <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma was raised </span>before the Sages: Did <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span>intend to <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that two <span class="gemarra-regular">side</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> posts and a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>are required, adding a stringency to Beit Shammai’s opinion, that in addition to the cross beam not one, but two side posts are required? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps he </span>intended to <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that two <span class="gemarra-regular">side </span><span class="gemarra-regular">posts without a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>are required. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to this dilemma from that which was related in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>. There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, who went to Rabbi Yosei ben Perida, his disciple</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>

Daf 12a

<span class="gemarra-regular">at </span>the town of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ovelin, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">found him dwelling in an alleyway that had only one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">side post</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He said to him: My son, set </span><span class="gemarra-regular">up another side post. </span>Rabbi Yosei <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Am</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I required to close it up</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Rabbi Eliezer <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: Let it be closed up; what does it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> matter? </span>
We learned in that same <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: Beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about an alleyway</span> whose width <span class="gemarra-regular">is less than four cubits, </span>as they both agree <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>this alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">does not require anything </span>to render it permitted for one to carry within it. <span class="gemarra-regular">About what did they disagree? About </span>an alleyway that is <span class="gemarra-regular">wider than four cubits, and up to ten </span>cubits; <span class="gemarra-regular">as Beit Shammai say: </span>It is permitted to carry within it only if there is both <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, and Beit Hillel say: </span>It requires <span class="gemarra-regular">either </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a side post or a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam.</span>
The Gemara explains the proof from this <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">In any case, it teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Rabbi Yosei ben Perida said to Rabbi Eliezer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Am I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> required to seal it? Granted, if you say </span>that Rabbi Eliezer requires two <span class="gemarra-regular">side posts and a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for that </span>reason the disciple <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Am I required to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seal it? However, if you say </span>that he requires <span class="gemarra-regular">side</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> posts without a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, what </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">to seal it? </span>The entrance to the alleyway remains open from above. 
The Gemara rejects this argument: No absolute proof can be cited from here, as perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what he is saying: Am</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I required to seal it with side posts?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel do not disagree about</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an alleyway </span>whose width <span class="gemarra-regular">is less than four cubits, </span>as they both agree <span class="gemarra-regular">that it does not require anything </span>to render it permitted to carry within it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t we learn </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">A certain disciple </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said before Rabbi Akiva in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway </span>whose width <span class="gemarra-regular">is less than four cubits, </span>as they both agree <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>carrying in an alleyway of that sort <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted by either a side post or a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam. </span>How could Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel have said that according to Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel even that minimal action is unnecessary? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: This is </span>what Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying. It neither requires </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shammai, nor </span>does it require two <span class="gemarra-regular">side posts, in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer; rather, </span>it requires <span class="gemarra-regular">either a side post or a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel </span>with regard to a large alleyway. When it said that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel does not require anything, it meant anything more than that required by Beit Hillel.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how </span>narrow must an alleyway be so that it would not require even a side post, according to all opinions? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Aḥlei said, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yeḥiel </span>who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Up to </span>a width of <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths, the alleyway requires nothing in order to render it permitted for one to carry within it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: The Rabbis </span><span class="gemarra-regular">concede to Rabbi Eliezer with regard to the </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> That is to say, the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer only about the number of side posts needed to permit carrying within an alleyway. However, they agree that if a courtyard was breached into the public domain, it can be considered closed only if upright boards of wall, similar to side posts, remain on both sides of the breach. <span class="gemarra-regular">But Rav Naḥman said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards of </span>wall that are required in <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Who </span>are the Rabbis to whom Rav referred when he stated that they <span class="gemarra-regular">concede </span>to Rabbi Eliezer? He was referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span> Yehuda HaNasi. Furthermore, as Rav Naḥman said that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, one can learn <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>this issue as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>are the ones who <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, as it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard </span>that was breached into the public domain, with the width of the breach not exceeding ten cubits, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>to carry if <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">board </span>remains on one side of the breach. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>It is permitted only if there remain <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards, </span>one on each side of the breach.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A courtyard </span>that was breached <span class="gemarra-regular">requires two </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards </span>of wall on either side of the breach, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Zeira said to Rabbi Asi: Did Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that? But weren’t you the one who said in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: The </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards in a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> courtyard must be four </span>handbreadths wide? This indicates that only one board is necessary. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that Rabbi Yoḥanan requires one upright <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths board <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>one side of the breach, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one upright <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths board <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>the other side of the breach, this is difficult. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rav Adda bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Avimi teach </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Ḥanina, and some </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappi, </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing a small courtyard that was breached along its entire length into a large courtyard. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that the residents of the large courtyard may use their courtyard even if the <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>courtyard has a width of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the large </span>one has a width of <span class="gemarra-regular">eleven </span>cubits. In this case, the difference between the length of the smaller courtyard and that of the larger courtyard is only one cubit, i.e., six handbreadths. Therefore, there cannot be upright boards of four handbreadths on each side, as together they would amount to more than a cubit.
The Gemara resolves this difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">When</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Zeira ascended from </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">sea </span>travels, <span class="gemarra-regular">he explained</span> the contradiction between the statements of Rav Yoḥanan in the following manner: If there is a upright board <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one direction, </span>it must be <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths, however, if there are upright boards <span class="gemarra-regular">from two directions, </span>it suffices if there is <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount here, </span>on one side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and any</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> amount there, </span>on the other side.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And that which Adda bar Avimi taught </span>with regard to the difference in size between the two courtyards is not universally accepted, as according to Rabbi Zeira it is sufficient if one courtyard is four handbreadths larger than the other. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>in accordance with the view of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, who requires two upright boards of wall in a breached courtyard. And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>who says that a side post must be at least three handbreadths wide. Consequently, the two upright boards together must be at least six handbreadths, which is why the minimum difference between the smaller and the larger courtyards is a cubit. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said that Rav Yehuda said that Shmuel said: </span>A breached <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard is permitted </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">board </span>of wall remains on one side of the breach. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef: Did Shmuel </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? But didn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel say to Rav Ḥananya bar Sheila: You must not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perform an action, </span>i.e., issue a ruling to permit carrying in a breached courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>there remains standing <span class="gemarra-regular">either </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the majority of the wall or two </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards </span>on either side of the breach. 
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">I do not know </span>how to resolve this contradiction. All I know is that <span class="gemarra-regular">there was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an incident in a shepherds’ village </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> narrow inlet of the sea that penetrated a courtyard, </span>breaching one of its walls in its entirety, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Yehuda, and he required only one </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">board </span>of wall to remain in order to permit it.
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Yosef: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span><span class="gemarra-regular">speak of a narrow in inlet of the sea, </span>but an inlet is different and nothing can be derived from that case, for we know that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is a leniency </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in which the Sages lessened </span>the requirements <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">water. </span>In these cases, the Sages did not require properly constructed partitions, but were satisfied with inferior ones. 
The Gemara supports the assertion that the Sages were more lax with regard to water from the following <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tavla </span><span class="gemarra-regular">raised before Rav: Does a suspended partition permit </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a ruin? </span>Do we say that the remnants of the walls that are suspended in the air are considered as if they descend to the ground, closing off the area so that it is regarded as a private domain? Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: A suspended partition </span>of this kind <span class="gemarra-regular">permits </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">water; this is a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">leniency in which the Sages lessened </span>the requirements <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any case, it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult. </span>The contradiction between the conflicting statements of Shmuel remains unresolved.
The Gemara resolves the difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Pappa and Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, came from the house of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their teacher, they explained </span>the contradiction in the following manner: If there is an upright board <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one direction</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it must be <span class="gemarra-regular">of four </span>handbreadths; but if there are upright boards <span class="gemarra-regular">from two directions, </span>i.e., both sides of he breach, it suffices if there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a bit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here, </span>on one side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and bit here, </span>on the other side.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: If </span>this issue <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult for me</span> to understand, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is my difficulty: For Shmuel said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Ḥananya bar Sheila: You must not perform an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">action, </span>i.e., issue a ruling to permit carrying in a breached courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>there remains standing <span class="gemarra-regular">either most of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the wall or two </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards </span>on either side of the breach. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I need most of the wall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>An upright <span class="gemarra-regular">board of four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">should suffice. </span>The Gemara further explains the difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say, what is</span> the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">most of the wall </span>mentioned here? It is referring to the special case where the <span class="gemarra-regular">wall </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>handbreadths wide, so that <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">constitutes most </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the wall, </span>this too is difficult. Even if the wall is seven handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>require an upright board of <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths to seal? <span class="gemarra-regular">Three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> any amount should suffice, as Rav Aḥlei, and some say</span> it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yeḥiel who said: </span>A narrow alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">up to four </span>handbreadths wide requires nothing at all. Here too, after sealing up slightly more than three handbreadths, the remaining gap that remains is less than four handbreadths, so nothing further should be required. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>the statement of Shmuel is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a courtyard, </span>where even a breach of less than four handbreadths requires action. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the statement of Rav Aḥlei, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to an alleyway. And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if you wish, say </span>that the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥlei</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is itself </span>subject to a dispute between the <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a narrow inlet of the sea that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enters into a courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> partially breaching one of its walls, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not fill </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">from it on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The inlet is a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, from which it is prohibited to carry into a private domain, e.g. a courtyard. This is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">unless there is a partition </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths high </span>at one side of the wall’s breach, which would incorporate the inlet as part of the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? Where the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> breach </span>through which the water enters <span class="gemarra-regular">is more than ten</span> cubits wide; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing is required.</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span>
The Gemara asks: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not fill </span>water from the inlet because that would involve carrying from a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> into a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>in the courtyard itself <span class="gemarra-regular">one may </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">carry. But isn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the courtyard breached along its entirety, </span>i.e., more than ten cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">into a place that is prohibited to it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Since it is prohibited to carry to or from the inlet, it should also be prohibited to carry within the courtyard itself. 

Daf 12b

The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here </span>in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the wall has not been fully breached, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">remnant</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the wall </span>remain on each side (Rabbeinu Ḥananel; Rif). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: </span>If several courtyards open onto a common alleyway, the residents of the houses in the courtyards are prohibited to carry in the alleyway, unless the alleyway is rendered fit for one to carry within it by placing a side post or a cross beam at its entrance, and by the inhabitants of each courtyard placing food in a common area for the duration of Shabbat, symbolically converting the entire alleyway into a single household. It is prohibited to carry in <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway </span>that the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">did not merge. </span>Nevertheless, if the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">was rendered fit by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a side </span><span class="gemarra-regular">post </span>placed at its entrance, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who throws </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">into it </span>from the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable; </span>the side post functions as a partition, and the alleyway is deemed a full-fledged private domain. If, however, the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rendered fit by </span>means of a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">throws </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">into it </span>from the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exempt; </span>the cross beam functions only as a conspicuous marker. It is not considered a partition that renders the alleyway a private domain. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet strongly objects to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>due to the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>that one is exempt in the latter case is due to the fact the residents of the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">did not merge. </span>By inference, <span class="gemarra-regular">if they did </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">merge, one would be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">liable even if </span>the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">was rendered fit by </span>way of a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam. </span>This, however, is difficult. One can ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does this loaf, </span>through which the residents joined together to form a single household, <span class="gemarra-regular">render </span>the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">a private</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> domain or a public domain?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Courtyards </span>shared <span class="gemarra-regular">by many and alleyways that are not open </span>on two opposite sides, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, one who throws </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">into them </span>from the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable. </span>This seems to contrary to Rav Yehuda’s statement.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated, it was stated as follows. Rav Yehuda said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway that is not fit for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> merging, </span>i.e., an alleyway that is open on two opposite sides, if the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">was rendered fit </span>for one to carry within it <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, one who throws </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">into it </span>from the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable. </span>In that case, the side post is considered a third partition, and since the alleyway is closed on three sides it is deemed a private domain. If, however, the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">was rendered fit </span>for one to carry within in <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who throws </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">into it is exempt. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>Rav Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> side post </span>functions <span class="gemarra-regular">as a partition, whereas a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam</span> functions <span class="gemarra-regular">as a conspicuous marker </span>but is not considered a partition. <span class="gemarra-regular">And, so too, Rabba said: A side post </span>functions <span class="gemarra-regular">as a partition, whereas </span>a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>functions <span class="gemarra-regular">as a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> conspicuous marker. But Rava said: Both this, </span>the side post, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that, </span>the cross beam, function <span class="gemarra-regular">as a conspicuous</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> marker.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov bar Abba raised an objection to Rava </span>from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who throws </span>an object from the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">into an alleyway, if </span>the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a side post, he is liable; if it does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have a side post he is exempt. </span>This shows that a side post is considered a proper partition.
Rava replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>If the alleyway is closed on one side such that <span class="gemarra-regular">it requires only a side post </span>in order to permit carrying within in, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who throws </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">into it </span>from the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>because the alleyway already has three partitions and is therefore a proper private domain according to Torah law. However, if the alleyway requires <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> side post and something else </span>in order to permit carrying within it, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who throws </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">into it </span>from the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">is exempt </span>because the alleyway has only two partitions and is therefore not considered a private domain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">He raised an </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">objectio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> to Rava from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is as follows with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has two houses </span>opposite each other <span class="gemarra-regular">on two sides of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the public domain, </span>if he chooses, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may </span>create a private domain for himself in the area of the public domain. He may <span class="gemarra-regular">place a </span>ten-handbreadth high <span class="gemarra-regular">side post</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from here, </span>perpendicular to the public domain. This creates a symbolic wall which, in the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of alleyways, has the legal status of a wall. <span class="gemarra-regular">And, </span>he may place <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span> additional <span class="gemarra-regular">post from here, </span>on the other side, and that has the same legal status as if he closed the public domain on all of its sides. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or, </span>he can implement a different solution appropriate for alleyways by placing <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> beam </span>extending <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>from one end of one house, to the end of the house opposite it. This creates a symbolic partition across the width of the street. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>he may place <span class="gemarra-regular">a beam </span>extending <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>from the other side of the house. According to Rabbi Yehuda, in that way, one is permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">carry </span>objects <span class="gemarra-regular">and place</span> them <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the symbolic partitions, as he would in a private domain.
The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: One may not place an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in that </span>way. One who seeks to transform a public domain into a private domain must place actual partitions. Apparently, according to Rabbi Yehuda, the side posts function as partitions in the public domain, creating a private domain between the two houses. It follows from this that a side post is in fact deemed a proper partition, contrary to Rava’s statement.
The Gemara answers: This is not the reason behind Rabbi Yehuda’s statement. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">there Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Torah law two partitions </span>suffice to constitute a private domain, and he requires side posts only as a conspicuous marker. Therefore, Rava’s position cannot be disproved from this source either.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said that Rav said:</span> Unlike other alleyways, carrying within <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway whose length is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> equal to its width is not permitted by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post of minimal </span>width. Like a courtyard, carrying within it is permitted only by means of an upright board four handbreadths wide. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the name of Rav: </span>Carrying within <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway whose length</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is equal to its width is not permitted by </span>a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>with the width <span class="gemarra-regular">of a handbreadth.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: How </span><span class="gemarra-regular">precise are the traditions of the Elders. </span>He explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the length </span>of the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">is equal to its width</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is </span>regarded like <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard, and </span>carrying within <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> courtyard is not permitted by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, but </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span> upright <span class="gemarra-regular">board of four </span>handbreadths.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: </span>Nonetheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>this issue <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult for me </span>to understand, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is my difficulty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Let this side post be </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>an upright <span class="gemarra-regular">board</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of minimal </span>width <span class="gemarra-regular">and permit </span>carrying within the alleyway, just as an upright board permits carrying in a breached courtyard. 
The Gemara explains that this is incorrect, as <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which Rabbi Asi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said escaped </span>Rabbi Zeira’s <span class="gemarra-regular">attention: The </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards of a courtyard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">must be four </span>handbreadths wide, whereas a side post may be of minimal size. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: We have a tradition</span> that states: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span>type of <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam? Any </span>alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">whose length is greater </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than its width and has houses and courtyards opening into </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it. And what is the </span>type of <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">is not permitted by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a side</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> post or </span>a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, but by </span>an upright <span class="gemarra-regular">board</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of four </span>handbreadths? <span class="gemarra-regular">Any </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">that is square.</span>
The Gemara wonders: If it is <span class="gemarra-regular">square, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>is it considered a courtyard? If it is <span class="gemarra-regular">round, no, </span>is it not considered a courtyard? The Gemara makes a correction: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> saying: If its length is greater than its width</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway, and </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> side post or a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam suffices; but if </span>its length is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>greater than its width, i.e., it is square, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">how much</span> must its length exceed its width so that it can be considered an alleyway? <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel thought </span>at first <span class="gemarra-regular">to say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>It is not considered an alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>its length <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> double its width, </span>until <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said to him: My </span><span class="gemarra-regular">uncle </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavivi</span>], Rav Ḥiyya, <span class="gemarra-regular">said this: Even </span>if its length is greater than its width by only <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> minimal amount, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of an alleyway apply to it.
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">A certain</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disciple said </span>before Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yishmael, etc. </span>

Daf 13a

The mishna relates that a student recited a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> before Rabbi Akiva, and he did not accept the student’s version of the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva said: They disagree about this, </span>an alleyway less than four cubits wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">and about that,</span> an alleyway more than four cubits wide.
The Gemara asks: In that case, the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva </span>is identical with the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the mishna, as he too holds that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree in all cases, irrespective of the width of the alleyway. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥlai, and some </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yeḥiel, </span>that an alleyway less than four handbreadths wide requires no corrective action. However, their respective opinions <span class="gemarra-regular">are not defined; </span>which <span class="it-text">tanna</span> accepts the view of Rav Aḥlai and which <span class="it-text">tanna</span> rejects it cannot be determined.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Akiva said: Rabbi Yishmael did not state this matter, </span>as it is unlikely that Rabbi Yishmael would err in this manner; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">that disciple who stated that matter </span>on his own, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">that disciple</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
With regard to that <span class="it-text">baraita</span> the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">itself is difficult. You stated </span>initially that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael did not state this matter; apparently the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of the disciple. <span class="gemarra-regular">And then you said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">that disciple. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: Rabbi Akiva said </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with that disciple <span class="gemarra-regular">only to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sharpen </span>the minds of <span class="gemarra-regular">his students with </span>his statement. Seeking to encourage his students to suggest novel opinions, he praised that disciple before them but did not actually rule in accordance with the disciple’s opinion. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said, </span>in another attempt to resolve the contradiction: The statement of the disciple <span class="gemarra-regular">appears </span>to be reasonable <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated. </span>Although Rabbi Yishmael himself did not make that statement, the statement of the disciple is reasonable. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Levi said: Anywhere that you find </span>a statement introduced with: <span class="gemarra-regular">A certain disciple said before Rabbi Akiva in the name</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi Yishmael, it is none other than Rabbi Meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who was the student <span class="gemarra-regular">who served </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Akiva.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir said: When I was</span> a student <span class="gemarra-regular">with Rabbi Yishmael, I used to put copper</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sulfate [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kankantom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into the in</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> with which I wrote Torah scrolls, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he did not say anything </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to me. When I came </span>to study <span class="gemarra-regular">with Rabbi Akiva, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he prohibited me </span>from doing <span class="gemarra-regular">so. </span>
The Gemara challenges this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that so? Didn’t Rav Yehuda say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the name of Rabbi Meir: When I studied with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Akiva </span>as his disciple, <span class="gemarra-regular">I used to put </span><span class="gemarra-regular">copper sulfate into the ink, and he did not say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">anything to me. But when I came </span>to study <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, he said to me: My son, what is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your vocation? I replied: I am a scribe [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lavlar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> who writes Torah scrolls. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to me: My son, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be careful in your vocation, as your vocation is heavenly </span><span class="gemarra-regular">service, </span>and care must be taken <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you omit a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">single letter or add a single letter </span>out of place, <span class="gemarra-regular">and you will end up destroying the whole world in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its entirety</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Addition or omission of a single letter can change the meaning from truth [<span class="it-text">emet</span>] to death [<span class="it-text">met</span>]. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">I said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I have one substance called copper sulfate, which I place</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into the ink, </span>and therefore I am not concerned. <span class="gemarra-regular">He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to me: May one place copper sulfate into the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ink? Didn’t the Torah state </span>with regard to <span class="it-text">sota</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span>the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">shall write </span>these curses in a book, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he shall blot them out </span>into the water of bitterness” (Numbers 5:23)? The Torah requires <span class="gemarra-regular">writing that can </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be blotted out.</span>
The Gemara clarifies elements of the conversation: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>Rabbi Yishmael <span class="gemarra-regular">saying to </span>Rabbi Meir, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he answering him? </span>Rabbi Meir’s response with regard to copper sulfate does not seem to address Rabbi Yishmael’s comments with regard to omissions and additions.
The Gemara explains that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying to </span>Rabbi Yishmael: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is no need </span>to mention <span class="gemarra-regular">defective and plene </span>words, <span class="gemarra-regular">as I am an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> expert; however, even with regard to the concern that a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fly might come and land on the crown of </span>the letter <span class="gemarra-italic">dalet</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and blot it out and render it a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">reish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> thereby changing the meaning of the word, I am not concerned, as <span class="gemarra-regular">I have a substance called copper</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sulfate that I place into the ink </span>so that it will not be erased.
Nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a difficulty between service and service, </span>as one source states that Rabbi Meir initially served Rabbi Akiva, whereas the other source states that he served Rabbi Yishmael first. <span class="gemarra-regular">There is a difficulty between </span>the words <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited it </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which is referring to Rabbi Akiva, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he prohibited it </span>in the statement of Rav Yehuda, which is referring to Rabbi Yishmael. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is no difficulty between </span>the accounts in the two sources with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">service and service, </span>as it can be suggested as follows: Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">initially came </span>to study <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Akiva, and since he was unable to comprehend </span>the teachings <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with his </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">he came before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yishmael and studied the tradition, and again came before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Akiva and studied logical </span>analysis. After studying the basic principles from Rabbi Yishmael, he was able to understand the more complex teachings of Rabbi Akiva. 
Having reconciled the first difficulty, the Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, the difficulty with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>whether Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>copper sulfate or Rabbi Yishmael <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>it remains <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. </span>The Gemara notes: It indeed remains <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult; </span>no answer was found.
The Gemara continues the discussion of copper sulfate. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir would say: One may place copper sulfate </span><span class="gemarra-regular">into the ink </span>that is to be used <span class="gemarra-regular">for all </span>sacred writings, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>the writing of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">passage </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sota</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as it must be possible to erase that writing. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov says in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his name: Except for </span>the writing of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">passage</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sota</span> used <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Templ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in the ordeal to determine the guilt or innocence of the wife suspected of adultery. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between their</span> opinions, i.e., what is their point of dispute? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yirmeya said: </span>The difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between their </span>opinions <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>whether it is permissible <span class="gemarra-regular">to erase </span>the passage of a <span class="it-text">sota</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from a Torah </span>scroll. The <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> disagree whether or not a section taken from a Torah scroll may be used for this purpose, or whether a special scroll must be written for use in the ordeal of the <span class="it-text">sota</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And those </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span> disagree in the same dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">as these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: A scroll that was written for one woman suspected of infidelity but was not used, <span class="gemarra-regular">her scroll is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not fit </span>to prepare the water <span class="gemarra-regular">to give to another </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sota</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to drink. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Aḥai bar Yoshiya said: Her </span><span class="gemarra-regular">scroll is fit </span>to be used to prepare the water <span class="gemarra-regular">to give another </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sota</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to drink. </span>The legal status of a Torah scroll, which is not written for a particular <span class="it-text">sota</span>, should be the same.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Perhaps that is not </span>the case, as the two circumstances are not comparable. <span class="gemarra-regular">The first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>his opinion that one woman’s scroll may not be used for another woman <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there; since it had </span>originally <span class="gemarra-regular">been designated in the name </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>one woman, e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">Rachel, it cannot then be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">designated in the name of </span>another woman, e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">Leah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> However, in the case of a Torah </span>scroll, <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written with no particular </span>person in mind, he <span class="gemarra-regular">too </span>may say that <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">erase </span>it to be used for another woman, and it is not disqualified because it was not written in her name.
Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said </span>in another attempt to resolve the matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps it is not so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as an additional distinction exists between the two cases: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Aḥai bar Yoshiya stated </span>his opinion that the first woman’s scroll may be used for another woman <span class="gemarra-regular">only there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because at least, </span>in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was written </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for a </span>particular <span class="gemarra-italic">sota</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the world. However, in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> case of a Torah </span>scroll, <span class="gemarra-regular">which was written for study</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">too </span>would agree that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not erase </span>it.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And does Rabbi Aḥai bar Yoshiya not hold</span> in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">that which we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If one wrote a bill of divorce to divorce </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his wife, </span>

Daf 13b

<span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">reconsidered </span>and did not divorce her, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a resident of his city </span><span class="gemarra-regular">found him and said: Your name is </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">my name, and your wife’s name is </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">as my wife’s name, </span>and we reside in the same town; give me the bill of divorce, and I will use it to divorce my wife, then this document <span class="gemarra-regular">is invalid to divorce with it? </span>Apparently, a man may not divorce his wife with a bill of divorce written for another woman, and the same should apply to the scroll of a <span class="it-text">sota</span>. 
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">How</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> can you compare </span>the two cases? <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>with regard to a bill of divorce, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he shall write for her” </span>(Deuteronomy 24:1), and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> require writing </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in her name, </span>specifically for her; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to a <span class="it-text">sota</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written: “And he shall perform with her </span>all this ritual” (Numbers 5:30), and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">we require performance in her</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> name. </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">her </span>case, the <span class="gemarra-regular">performance is erasure; </span>however, writing of the scroll need not be performed specifically for her.
On the topic of Rabbi Meir and his Torah study, the Gemara cites an additional statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">It is revealed and known before the One Who spoke </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the world came into being that in the generation </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Mei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there was no </span>one of the Sages who is <span class="gemarra-regular">his equal. Why </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">establish the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with his </span>opinion? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because his colleagues were unable to ascertain the profundity of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his opinion. </span>He was so brilliant that he could present a cogent argument for any position, even if it was not consistent with the prevalent <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">As he </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">state</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to </span>a ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure </span>item that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">pure, and display justification </span>for that ruling, and likewise he would state <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">pure </span>item that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">impure, and display justification </span>for that ruling. The Sages were unable to distinguish between the statements that were <span class="it-text">halakha</span> and those that were not.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was not his name; rather, Rabbi Nehorai was his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">name. And why was he called </span>by the <span class="gemarra-regular">name Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Meir? </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">because he illuminates [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the eyes of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Sages in </span>matters of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Nehorai was not the name </span>of the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> known by that name; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, Rabbi Neḥemya was his name, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">some say: Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh was his name. And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">why was he called </span>by the <span class="gemarra-regular">name Rabbi Nehorai? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because he enlightens [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">manhir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the eyes of the Sages</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>matters of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that I am </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">incisive than my colleagues is </span>due to the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I saw Rabbi Meir from behind, </span>i.e., I sat behind him when I was his student. <span class="gemarra-regular">Had I seen</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him from the front</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I would be </span>even more <span class="gemarra-regular">incisive, as it is written: “And your eyes shall see</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your teacher” </span>(Isaiah 30:20). Seeing the face of one’s teacher increases one’s understanding and sharpens one’s mind.
And the Gemara stated that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan said: Rabbi Meir had a disciple, and his name </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was Sumakhus, who would state with regard to each and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">every matter of ritual impurity forty-eight reasons </span>in support of the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity, and with regard to each </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and every matter of ritual purity forty-eight reasons </span>in support of the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">purity.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">There was a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> distinguished disciple at Yavne who could </span>with his incisive intellect <span class="gemarra-regular">purify the creeping animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> explicitly deemed ritually impure by the Torah, adducing <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred and fifty reasons </span>in support of his argument. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: I </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">will deliberate and purify </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>employing the following reasoning: <span class="gemarra-regular">And just as a snake </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that kills </span>people and animals <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">increases ritual impurity </span>in the world, as a corpse imparts impurity through contact, through being carried, and by means of a tent, <span class="gemarra-regular">is ritually pure </span>and transmits no impurity, <span class="gemarra-regular">a creeping animal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that does not kill and </span>does not <span class="gemarra-regular">increase impurity </span>in the world, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>should it be pure.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is not so; </span>that is not a valid <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> argument, as it can be refuted. A snake <span class="gemarra-regular">is performing a mere act </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a thorn. </span>A thorn causes injury and even death; nevertheless, it is not ritually impure. The same applies to a snake, and therefore this <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> argument is rejected. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: For three</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> years Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagreed. These said: The</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with our </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">and these said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with our </span>opinion. Ultimately, <span class="gemarra-regular">a Divine Voice emerged and proclaimed: </span>Both <span class="gemarra-regular">these and those </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are the words of the living God</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> However, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since both these and those are the words of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> living God, why were Beit Hillel privileged to </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> established in accordance with their </span>opinion? The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that they were agreeable and forbearing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> showing restraint when affronted, and when they taught the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> they would <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">statements and the statements of Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shammai. Moreover, </span>when they formulated their teachings and cited a dispute, <span class="gemarra-regular">they prioritized the statements of Beit Shammai to their</span> own <span class="gemarra-regular">statements, </span>in deference to Beit Shammai.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">that we learned: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one whose head and most of his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> body were in the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but his table was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the house, Beit Shammai deem </span>this <span class="it-text">sukka</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">invalid; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel deem it valid. Beit Hillel said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai: Wasn’t there an incident in which the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elders of Beit Shammai and the Elders of Beit Hillel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">went to visit Rabbi Yoḥanan ben HaḤoranit, and they found</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him sitting </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">his head and most of his body</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but his table was in the house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Beit Shammai said to them: From there </span>do you seek to adduce <span class="gemarra-regular">a proof? </span>Those visitors, <span class="gemarra-regular">too, said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: If that was </span>the manner in which <span class="gemarra-regular">you were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accustomed </span>to perform the mitzva, <span class="gemarra-regular">you have never fulfilled the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">your days. </span>It is apparent from the phrasing of the mishna that when the Sages of Beit Hillel related that the Elders of Beit Shammai and the Elders of Beit Hillel visited Rabbi Yoḥanan ben HaḤoranit, they mentioned the Elders of Beit Shammai before their own Elders.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">to teach you that anyone who humbles</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> himself, the Holy One, Blessed be He, exalts him, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> anyone who exalts himself, the Holy One, Blessed be He</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, humbles him. Anyone who seeks greatness, greatness flees from him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and, </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who flees from greatness, greatness seeks him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And anyone who </span>attempts to <span class="gemarra-regular">force the moment </span>and expends great effort to achieve an objective precisely when he desires to do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">the moment forces him </span>too, and he is unsuccessful. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who </span>is patient and <span class="gemarra-regular">yields</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the moment, the moment stands </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>side, and he will ultimately be successful. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">For two and a half years</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagreed. These say: It would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have been preferable had man not been created than to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have been created. And those said: It is preferable for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> man to have been created than had he not been</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> created. </span>Ultimately, <span class="gemarra-regular">they were counted and concluded</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> It would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have been preferable had man not been created than to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have been created. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">now that he has been </span><span class="gemarra-regular">created, he should examine his actions </span>that he has performed and seek to correct them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say: He should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">scrutinize his </span>planned <span class="gemarra-regular">action</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> and evaluate whether or not and in what manner those actions should be performed, so that he will not sin.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, which </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>may be used to render an alleyway fit for one to carry within it, must be <span class="gemarra-regular">wide enough </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to receive </span>and hold <span class="gemarra-regular">a small </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brick</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">small brick </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">half a large brick, </span>which measures <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span><span class="gemarra-regular">handbreadths</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a handbreadth and a half. <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is sufficient that the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam will be a handbreadth </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in width, </span>not a handbreadth and a half, <span class="gemarra-regular">enough to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hold a small brick across its width. </span>
And the cross beam must be <span class="gemarra-regular">wide enough to hold a small brick </span>and also <span class="gemarra-regular">sturdy enough to hold a small bric</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> and not collapse. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>If it is <span class="gemarra-regular">wide </span>enough to hold the brick, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though it is not sturdy </span>enough to actually support it, it is sufficient. Therefore, even if the cross beam <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>made <span class="gemarra-regular">of straw or reeds, one considers</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it as though it were </span>made <span class="gemarra-regular">of metal.</span>
If the cross beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">curved, </span>so that a small brick cannot rest on it, <span class="gemarra-regular">one considers it as though it were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">straight</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">round, one considers it as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">though it were square. </span>The following principle was stated with regard to a round cross beam: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any </span>beam <span class="gemarra-regular">with a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">circumference of three handbreadths is a handbreadth in width, </span>i.e., in diameter. 

Daf 14a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara questions the statement in the mishna with regard to the minimum width of the cross beam: <span class="gemarra-regular">A handbreadth? A handbreadth and a half is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">required, </span>as a small brick is a handbreadth and a half wide. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the cross beam <span class="gemarra-regular">is wide enough to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> receive </span>and hold <span class="gemarra-regular">a handbreadth, one can affix the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">remaining half handbreadth with plaster, </span>a small <span class="gemarra-regular">amount on this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">side and a </span>small <span class="gemarra-regular">amount on </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">side, and </span>the brick will <span class="gemarra-regular">stand </span>in place. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna said: The </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of which </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">spoke must be sturdy enough to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> receive </span>and hold <span class="gemarra-regular">a small brick; however, the supports </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">bea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> need not be sturdy </span>enough <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> receive </span>and hold a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam and a small brick</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Criteria were established for the cross beam itself, which renders the alleyway fit for one to carry within it; criteria were not established for its supports. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda </span>disagreed and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Both this, </span>the beam, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that, </span>its supports, <span class="gemarra-regular">must be sturdy </span>enough <span class="gemarra-regular">to hold </span>a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a small brick.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: If one placed </span>a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam over </span>the entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an alleyway, and draped a mat over it, and raised</span> the lower end of the mat <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there is neither </span>a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor is there a partition here </span>to render the alleyway fit for one to carry within it. <span class="gemarra-regular">There is neither</span> a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam here, as it is obscured </span>and therefore inconspicuous. <span class="gemarra-regular">Nor is there a partition here, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a partition </span>that is more than three handbreadths off the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">through which goats can pass, </span>and therefore it does not have the legal status of a partition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Our Sages taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam projects from this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wall </span>of an alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">but does not touch that wall </span>opposite, <span class="gemarra-regular">and similarly, </span>if there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beams, one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> projecting from this wall and one projecting from that wall</span> opposite, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they do not touch one another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if there is a gap of <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>handbreadths between the beam and the wall, or between the two beams respectively, <span class="gemarra-regular">one need not bring another </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>to render the alleyway fit for one to carry within it, as they are considered joined based on the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span>. However, if there is a gap of <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">one must bring another </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gamliel says: </span>If the gap is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than four </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">one need not bring another </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam. </span>However, if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must bring another </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, </span>as in his opinion the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span> applies to a gap up to four handbreadths wide.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">two matching, </span>extremely narrow cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> are placed alongside each other, even though <span class="gemarra-regular">there is not </span>sufficient width <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>beam <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> receive a small brick, and there is not </span>sufficient width <span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span>beam, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the two beams together can <span class="gemarra-regular">receive a small brick along its handbreadth width, one need </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not bring another </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>to render the alleyway fit for one to carry within it; <span class="gemarra-regular">but if not, one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is required to bring another </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Gamliel says: If </span>the two cross beams can <span class="gemarra-regular">receive</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a small brick along its length, </span>which is <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">one need not bring another </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, but if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not, one must bring another </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">If</span> these two narrow cross beams <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>placed <span class="gemarra-regular">one above and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one below</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: One considers the upper </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">as though it were below</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the lower one as though it were above, </span>i.e., close together. If the two together are fit to hold a small brick, they render the alleyway fit for one to carry within it, although they are not actually close to each other, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that the upper </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not above twenty cubits and the lower </span>one is not <span class="gemarra-regular">below ten </span>handbreadths, between which a cross beam renders an alleyway fit for one to carry within it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">his father with regard to one </span>matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees with his </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to one </span>matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">his father in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he is </span>of the opinion that the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">One considers, </span>applies. Just as Rabbi Yehuda stated in the mishna that the cross beam is considered as though it were sturdy even though it is not, his son, Rabbi Yosei, holds that one considers two cross beams placed apart as though they were adjacent.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Yosei <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees with his </span>father’s opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to one </span>matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">While Rabbi Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that a cross beam renders an alleyway fit for one to carry within it even if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">higher </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than twenty </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Within twenty cubits, yes, </span>it renders the alleyway fit for one to carry within it; <span class="gemarra-regular">above twenty, </span>it does <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
It was stated in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda says: </span>It suffices if the cross beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">wide</span> enough to hold a small brick, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not sturdy </span>enough to actually support it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>this clause of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">to Ḥiyya bar Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of Rav: </span>It suffices if the cross beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">wide </span>enough to hold a small brick, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">though it is not sturdy </span>enough to actually support it. Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Teach </span>it to <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wide </span>enough <span class="gemarra-regular">and sturdy </span>enough to hold a small brick.
The Gemara challenges this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Elai say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>A cross beam that is <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> renders an alleyway fit for one to carry within it <span class="gemarra-regular">even if it is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sturdy </span>enough to hold a small brick? The Gemara answers: A cross beam that is <span class="gemarra-regular">four handbreadths wide is different, </span>as a beam of that width is considered a roof and not a beam. It is considered as though the edge of the roof descended and constituted an actual partition, not merely a conspicuous distinction. 
It was stated in the mishna: Even <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the cross beam <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>made <span class="gemarra-regular">of straw </span>or reeds, one considers it as though it were made of metal. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us? </span>If it is teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">that we say one considers </span>the cross beam as though it were fit to bear a brick, then <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>clause <span class="gemarra-regular">is the same as the </span>previous clause in the mishna: Wide enough even though it is not sturdy enough.
The Gemara answers: There is a novel point here, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that with regard to a cross beam made of material that other beams <span class="gemarra-regular">of its own kind </span>are sturdy, e.g., wood, <span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>that even the flimsiest of cross beams is considered sturdy. However, with regard to a cross beam made of material that only beams <span class="gemarra-regular">not of its own</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> kind </span>are sturdy, e.g., straw, which can never support a brick, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say </span>that one considers the cross beam as if it were made of metal. Therefore, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that there is no difference between the cases. 
It was taught in the mishna: If the cross beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">curved</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one considers it as though it were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">straight. </span>The Gemara challenges: That is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious. </span>The Gemara answers that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Zeira, as Rabbi Zeira said: </span>If the cross beam <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inside the alleyway, and its curved </span>section <span class="gemarra-regular">is outside the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway; </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">it is within twenty </span>cubits of the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">and its curved </span>section <span class="gemarra-regular">is above twenty </span>cubits; or <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is above ten </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">and its curved </span>section <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">below ten </span>handbreadths, meaning that the curved part of the beam is outside the area where a cross beam is effective, <span class="gemarra-regular">one considers </span>the situation: In <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">where, were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the curved </span>section outside the area where a cross beam is effective <span class="gemarra-regular">removed, there would not be </span>a gap of <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">between this </span>effective part of the cross beam <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>effective part of the cross beam, <span class="gemarra-regular">one need</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not bring another </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam. And if not, </span>if the gap would be greater, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must bring another </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam. </span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">That too is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> obvious, </span>as the curved portion of the cross beam is considered as though it were straight. The Gemara explains: In a case where the cross beam <span class="gemarra-regular">is inside the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway and its curved </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">is outside the alleyway, it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was necessary for him </span>to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: Let us be concerned that he </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">come to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be drawn after it </span>and carry in the area where the curvature extends beyond the alleyway, Rabbi Zeira <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this is not a concern.
The mishna continues: If the cross beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">round</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one considers it as though it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were square. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I need </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>clause <span class="gemarra-regular">as well? </span>Similar cases were already taught in the mishna. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary </span>to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause </span>of this section, i.e., the principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>circle <span class="gemarra-regular">with a circumference of three handbreadths is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a handbreadth in diameter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these matters, </span>this ratio between circumference and diameter, derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse said </span>with regard to King Solomon: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he made a molten sea, ten cubits </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from the one brim to the other: It was round </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all about, and its height was five cubits; and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">line of thirty cubits did circle it round about” </span>(I Kings 7:23).
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t there its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brim </span>that must be taken into account? The diameter of the sea was measured from the inside, and if its circumference was measured from the outside, this ratio is no longer accurate. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Pappa said: With regard to its brim, it is written </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the brim </span>is as <span class="gemarra-regular">the petals of a lily,</span> as stated in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And it was a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">handbreadth thick; and its brim was wrought as the brim </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a cup, as the petals of a lily; it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contained two thousand </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> (I Kings 7:26). The brim was very thin.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t there </span>the minimal <span class="gemarra-regular">amount </span>of the thickness of the brim? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> calculates </span>the circumference, <span class="gemarra-regular">he calculates from the inside</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The sea that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Solomon fashioned contained </span>a volume of <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred and fifty </span><span class="gemarra-regular">baths of ritual purification. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">After all, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a ritual bath, how much is </span>its volume? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">forty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it was taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he shall bathe his flesh</span>

Daf 14b

<span class="gemarra-regular">in water</span>; specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the water of a ritual bath. </span>The expression <span class="gemarra-regular">“all his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> flesh” </span>(Leviticus 15:16) teaches that one must immerse in <span class="gemarra-regular">water that his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whole body can enter </span>at once. <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is that? A cubit by a cubit by the height </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of three cubits. And the Sages calculated </span>that the volume of <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span>necessary for <span class="gemarra-regular">a ritual bath </span>of this size <span class="gemarra-regular">is forty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara now calculates <span class="gemarra-regular">how many </span>ritual baths should have been contained in Solomon’s Sea. The volume of the sea was <span class="gemarra-regular">five hundred </span>cubic <span class="gemarra-regular">cubits, </span>as it was ten cubits in length, ten cubits in width, and five cubits in height. The minimum volume of a ritual bath is three cubic cubits. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">three hundred </span>cubic cubits is the volume of <span class="gemarra-regular">a hundred </span>ritual baths, and <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hundred and fifty </span>cubic cubits is the volume of another <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty </span>ritual baths. Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">four hundred and fifty </span>cubic cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">are enough </span>to contain a hundred and fifty ritual baths; but the volume of the sea was five hundred.
The Gemara answers that there is an error in the calculation: <span class="gemarra-regular">These </span>calculations with regard to the volume of the sea would <span class="gemarra-regular">apply to a square, </span>but the <span class="gemarra-regular">sea fashioned by Solomon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was round, </span>and its volume was therefore smaller.
The Gemara continues to ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, how much larger is a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">square </span>of ten-by-ten cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">than a circle </span>with a diameter of ten cubits? <span class="gemarra-regular">A quarter. </span>Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">four hundred</span> cubic cubits of our original calculation must be reduced to three hundred, which is the volume of <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred </span>ritual baths; and the remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">hundred </span>cubits must be reduced to seventy-five, which is the volume of <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-five </span>ritual baths. According to this calculation, Solomon’s Sea was the size of only <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred and twenty-five </span>ritual baths, not one hundred and fifty as stated above.
In answer to this question, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Yeḥezkel taught </span>as follows: In the <span class="gemarra-regular">sea that Solomon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fashioned, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">three lower cubits were squar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">upper</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two were round</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Consequently, the three lower cubits of the sea contained the volume of a hundred ritual baths, and its upper three cubits contained the volume of fifty ritual baths, for a total of one hundred and fifty ritual baths.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Although you cannot say the opposite, </span>that the bottom of the sea was round, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written </span>in the verse that <span class="gemarra-regular">its brim was round; </span>you can, <span class="gemarra-regular">however</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, say </span>that only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>cubit on top was round.
The Gemara rejects this possibility: <span class="gemarra-regular">This cannot </span><span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind, as it is written </span>with regard to the sea: “And it was a handbreadth thick, and its brim was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the petals of a lily; <span class="gemarra-regular">it contained two thousand </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(i Kings 7:26). <span class="gemarra-regular">How much is </span>the measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">bat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Three </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as the verse states: “Concerning the ordinance of oil, the <span class="it-text">bat</span> of oil, you shall offer <span class="gemarra-regular">the tenth part of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is a <span class="it-text">ḥomer</span> of ten <span class="it-text">bat</span>, for ten <span class="it-text">bat</span> are a <span class="it-text">ḥomer</span>” (Ezekiel 45:14). This proves that the <span class="it-text">bat</span> is a tenth of a <span class="it-text">kor</span>, or three <span class="it-text">se</span><span class="it-text">’a</span>, as a <span class="it-text">kor</span> is thirty <span class="it-text">se’a</span>. Consequently, the sea, which contained two thousand <span class="it-text">bat</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">contained six thousand </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the volume of exactly one hundred and fifty ritual baths.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it written </span>elsewhere with regard to Solomon’s Sea: <span class="gemarra-regular">“It received </span>and held <span class="gemarra-regular">three thousand </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(ii Chronicles 4:5)? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the heaped measure </span>of dry goods that the sea could hold, as dry goods can be heaped above the brim.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Learn from it </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the surplus </span>of dry goods in a vessel relative to liquids <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one-third </span>of the contents of the vessel. <span class="gemarra-regular">We also </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>the same thing in the following mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">A carriage, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a box, and a cupboard, a round straw barrel, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a round barrel </span>made <span class="gemarra-regular">of reeds, and the cistern of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an Alexandrian ship, </span>which is a large vessel placed on a boat and filled with potable water, <span class="gemarra-regular">although </span>these vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">have bottoms, </span>i.e., they are receptacles, since they <span class="gemarra-regular">have a capacity of forty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">liquid, which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the </span>equivalent of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">dry </span>goods, they are <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually pure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Even if they come into contact with a source of ritual impurity, they do not become impure. Beyond a certain size, containers are no longer considered vessels and, consequently, cannot become ritually impure. This mishna states clearly that a vessel that holds forty <span class="it-text">se’a</span> of liquids can hold two <span class="it-text">kor</span>, or sixty <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, of dry goods. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The side posts </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">spoke </span>of with regard to rendering an alleyway fit for one to carry within it, <span class="gemarra-regular">their height </span>must be at least <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and their width and thickness </span>may be <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span><span class="gemarra-regular">amount</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: Their width </span>must be at least <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The side posts </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">spoke </span>of, <span class="gemarra-regular">etc.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say the mishna taught an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> unattributed ruling in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who said </span>that in order to permit carrying in an alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>two <span class="gemarra-regular">side posts? </span>
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No; what </span>is meant by the plural term <span class="gemarra-regular">side posts? Side posts in general, </span>and not those required by a single alleyway. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the previous mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">also teach </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>with the plural term cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beams, and </span>we would say: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by the plural term cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beams? </span>Cross beams <span class="gemarra-regular">in general.</span>
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">saying: Those side posts that Rabbi Eliezer and the Sages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">disagreed about, </span>of which Rabbi Eliezer required two and the Sages sufficed with one, <span class="gemarra-regular">their height </span>must be at least <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths, and their width and thickness </span>may be <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">any amount</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: Even as </span>small as <span class="gemarra-regular">the string </span>used to tie <span class="gemarra-regular">a coat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who erected a side post for half an alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he put it up halfway down the alleyway rather than at its entrance, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has </span>the right to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in the inner <span class="gemarra-regular">half of the alleyway, </span>but not in the outer half. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious; </span>what novel element was introduced here? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: He may </span>carry in the inner <span class="gemarra-regular">half of the alleyway</span> even though there is no side post at the entrance to the alleyway. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">That too is obvious</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara explains that nonetheless there is a novelty here: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we should be concerned that </span>if it is permitted to carry in the inner half <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> might come to use the entire </span>alleyway, the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span> that carrying in the inner half is permitted. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who erected a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> side post in an alleyway and raised it three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from the ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or distanced it three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the wall, he has not done anything, </span>as it is not a valid side post. <span class="gemarra-regular">Even according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who said: We say </span>that objects separated by a gap of up to four handbreadths are considered <span class="gemarra-regular">connected, that applies only above, </span>e.g., to a cross beam that does not reach the wall of the alleyway; <span class="gemarra-regular">but below, since it is a partition</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> through which goats can pass, </span>as a goat can pass through an opening three handbreadths high, even <span class="gemarra-regular">he did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not say </span>that they are considered connected.
We learned in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosei says: The width </span>of the side posts must be at least <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths. Rav Yosef said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, not with regard to</span> preparing salt <span class="gemarra-regular">brine [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hilmei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to side posts.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Ḥinana said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: With regard to brine you told us </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, but <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to side posts you did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not tell us </span>this; perhaps you have forgotten that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with his view in that case. Rav Yosef asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different about brine, </span>with regard to which <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages disagree with </span>Rabbi Yosei? In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">side posts also the Sages disagree with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him, </span>and therefore the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> should not be in accordance with his view in either case. Rav Huna bar Ḥinana <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Side posts are different, as Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, and therefore the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> may be decided in accordance with their jointly held position.
The Gemara reports that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Raḥumei taught this </span>version of the previous discussion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda, the son of Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shmuel bar Sheilat, said in the name of Rav: The</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosei, not with regard to brine and not with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to side posts. </span>At some later point, someone <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: Did you </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>this? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: No. Rava said, </span>reinforcing his words with an oath: <span class="gemarra-regular">By</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> God! He did </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">say this, and I learned</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it from him, </span>but he later retracted this ruling. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span>is the <span class="gemarra-regular">reason he retracted it? Due to </span>the well-known principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei’s reasoning [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nimmuko</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is with him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> follows his opinion even against the majority view. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava bar Rav Ḥanan said to Abaye: What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the </span>accepted <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> with regard to the width of a side post? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: Go out </span>and observe <span class="gemarra-regular">what the people are doing; </span>it is common practice to rely on a side post of minimal width. 
The Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> answer was given <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span>discussion: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> drinks water </span>to quench <span class="gemarra-regular">his thirs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> recites </span>the following blessing prior to drinking: <span class="gemarra-regular">By Whose word all things came </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to be. Rabbi Tarfon </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>he recites the blessing: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who creates the many forms of life and their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">needs, for all that You have created. Rav Ḥanan said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Abaye: What is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? He said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Go out </span>and observe <span class="gemarra-regular">what the people are doing; </span>the customary practice is to say: By Whose word all things came to be. 

Daf 15a

<span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’</span><span class="it-text">im</span> disagreed about <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post that stands by itself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a side post at the entrance to an alleyway that was not put there for the express purpose of permitting one to carry on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: It is a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">side post. Rava said: It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">side post. </span>
The Gemara first narrows the scope of the dispute: In a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the inhabitants of the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">did not rely on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it from yesterday, </span>e.g., the alleyway had another side post that fell down on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">all agree that it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">side post. Where they disagree </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they relied on it from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">yesterday</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abaye said: It is a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">side post,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as they relied on it from yesterday. Rava said: It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">side post; since it was not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> originally erected for this purpose, it is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> valid <span class="gemarra-regular">side post.</span>
The Gemara comments: It might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind </span>to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as they disagree with regard to a side post</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, they also disagree with regard to </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">a partition </span>that was not erected to serve that function is considered a valid partition. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof based upon what we learned in the following mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who makes his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> among </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the trees, and the trees serve as its walls</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">valid </span><span class="it-text">sukka</span>. This proves that the trees function as partitions even though they were not erected for this purpose. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in this mishna? To a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he planted </span>the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">from the outset for this </span>purpose. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that the trees constitute valid walls. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">should issue a </span>decree to prohibit using a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> with trees as its walls, due to a concern that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one will come to use the tree </span>on the Festival and detach a branch or leaf in the process, the mishna therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that no such decree was made and the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> is permitted.
The Gemara tries to present another proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">there was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a tree there, or a fence, or a barrier of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reeds </span>that are interconnected and form a hedge, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> judged </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">double post, </span>i.e., it qualifies as a partition suitable to enclose a public well, as will be explained below. This indicates that a partition not constructed to serve as a partition is nonetheless valid. 
The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, too, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with what are we dealing? </span>With a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">constructed them from the outset for this </span>purpose. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, what does it teach us; </span>is it not obvious that it is a valid double post? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It teaches us </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a barrier of reeds</span> is a valid partition if the distance between <span class="gemarra-regular">one reed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the next is less than three handbreadths, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma to Rabba, </span>and the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that it is valid. 
The Gemara suggests another proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the following mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree </span>whose branches <span class="gemarra-regular">hang over </span>from a height of greater than ten handbreadths and reach almost to <span class="gemarra-regular">the ground, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the ends of <span class="gemarra-regular">its branches are not higher than </span><span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths from the ground, one may carry under it; </span>the branches constitute partitions all around, and it is therefore permissible to carry in the enclosed area. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, too, with what are we dealing? </span>With a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he planted </span>the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">from the outset for this </span>purpose. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so, it should </span>be permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">carry in all of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>no matter how large the area. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Huna, the son of Rav Yehoshua, say: One may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only carry </span>under the tree if its branches enclose an area no larger than <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., five thousand square cubits? If the area is larger, it is not considered a courtyard, and carrying there is prohibited. This indicates that the branches are not considered full-fledged partitions. 
The Gemara answers: The reason that carrying is permitted only if the enclosed area is less than this size is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a dwelling whose use is for </span>the open <span class="gemarra-regular">air </span>beyond it, i.e., it is used by guards who are watching the fields beyond it, rather than as an independent dwelling place, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any dwelling</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whose use is for </span>the open <span class="gemarra-regular">air </span>beyond it is that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may carry in it only if </span>its area is no larger than <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara suggests another proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>that which was taught in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">established his Shabbat </span>abode <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a mound that was ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high and </span>its area was anywhere <span class="gemarra-regular">from four cubits to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and similarly, </span>one who established his Shabbat abode <span class="gemarra-regular">in a </span>natural <span class="gemarra-regular">cavit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> of a rock <span class="gemarra-regular">that is ten</span> handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">deep and </span>its area was anywhere <span class="gemarra-regular">from four cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>and similarly, one who established his Shabbat abode in a field of <span class="gemarra-regular">reaped grain, and</span> rows of <span class="gemarra-regular">stalks </span>ten handbreadths high that have not been reaped <span class="gemarra-regular">surround it, </span>serving as a partition enclosing the reaped area, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may walk in the entire </span>enclosed area, <span class="gemarra-regular">and outside it </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits. </span>This indicates that a partition not specifically constructed to serve as a partition is nonetheless valid. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">here, too, </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he made it from the outset for this </span>purpose, there is a difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>in the case of the <span class="gemarra-regular">grain, </span>this answer is <span class="gemarra-regular">all right; but </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a mound and a cavity, what can be said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> They were there from time immemorial and were not constructed to serve as partitions. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the Gemara rejects its previous argument and explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to partitions, all agree that </span>a partition that stands by itself <span class="gemarra-regular">is a partition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> despite the fact that it was not erected for that purpose. <span class="gemarra-regular">Where they disagree </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a side post. Abaye follows his </span>usual line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as he said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a side </span><span class="gemarra-regular">post </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">as a partition, and a partition that stands </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by itself is a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">partition. And Rava follows his </span>usual line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as he said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a side </span><span class="gemarra-regular">post </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">as a conspicuous marker. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">if it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> made with </span>a person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hands </span>for that purpose, <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a conspicuous marker; and if not, it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a conspicuous marker.</span>
The Gemara now attempts to prove which side is correct according to this version of the dispute. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">stones</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a wall that protrude from the wall </span>and are <span class="gemarra-regular">separated from each other </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is no need for another side post </span>in order to permit carrying in the alleyway; the protruding stones join together to form a side post. However, if they are separated by <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a need for another side</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> post. </span>This indicates that a side post is valid even if it was not erected for that purpose. 
The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, too, </span>we are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one built them from the outset for this </span>purpose. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, it is obvious </span>that the side post is valid. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that it was only <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to connect the building </span>to another building that <span class="gemarra-regular">he built </span>the wall with protruding stones, <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches us </span>that it is a valid side post. We are not concerned that onlookers might assume that the wall was not originally built as a side post. 
The Gemara suggests another proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the following <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught by Rabbi Ḥiyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: A wall, one side of which is more recessed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than the other, whether </span>the indentation <span class="gemarra-regular">is visible from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">outside and </span>the wall looks <span class="gemarra-regular">even from the inside, or </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is visible from the inside and </span>the wall looks <span class="gemarra-regular">even from the outside, it is considered a side post. </span>This indicates that a side post is valid even if it was not erected for that purpose. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, too, </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one fashioned</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it from the outset for this </span>purpose, to serve as a side post. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does it teach us? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This teaches us</span> that a side post that <span class="gemarra-regular">is visible from the outside</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>looks <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">from the inside is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> considered a side post, </span>although this view is not universally accepted.
The Gemara suggests another proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the following story: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was sitting in a certain alleyway, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sitting before him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He said to his attendant: Go</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, bring me a </span>small <span class="gemarra-regular">pitcher of water. By the time</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he came </span>back with the water, <span class="gemarra-regular">the side post </span>at the entrance to the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">had fallen. </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">signaled to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him with his hand </span>that he should stop, and the attendant <span class="gemarra-regular">stood in his place. Rav Huna said to </span>Rav: <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t the Master hold </span>that it is permissible <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rely on the palm tree </span>located at the entrance to this alleyway as a side post? Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said: This </span><span class="gemarra-regular">scholar, </span>Rav Huna, <span class="gemarra-regular">is comparable to one who does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">know the teachings </span>of the Sages. <span class="gemarra-regular">Did we rely on </span>the palm tree <span class="gemarra-regular">from yesterday? </span>Since we did not, carrying in the alleyway is not permitted. 
Based on Rav’s response, the Gemara argues as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>that the palm tree could not serve as a side post is <span class="gemarra-regular">because we did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rely </span>on the palm tree from yesterday. This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">had we relied </span>on it, <span class="gemarra-regular">it would be a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">side post, </span>thus proving that a side post that was not erected for that purpose is nonetheless valid, in accordance with the opinion of Abaye.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Rava disagree </span>only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not rely on it </span>before Shabbat, but in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they did rely on it, </span>all agree <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">side post? </span>The Gemara answers: This <span class="gemarra-regular">should not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enter your mind, as there was a certain balcony [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">barka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was in the house of Bar Ḥavu that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abaye and Rava disagreed about their entire lives. </span>The residents of the alleyway began relying on a pillar upon which the balcony rested as their side post. Since Abaye and Rava disagreed about this case, it is clear that their disagreement applies even when the residents had relied on the item as a side post from before Shabbat. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One may construct side posts from anything, even</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a living </span><span class="gemarra-regular">creature</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> provided that it was properly attached to the entrance of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibits </span>using a living creature as a side post. The mishna continues with a similar dispute: Even a living creature <span class="gemarra-regular">imparts ritual impurity </span>if it used as the <span class="gemarra-regular">covering of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">grave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 

Daf 15b

<span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meir deems it pure. </span>Likewise, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may write women’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bills of divorce on </span>anything, even a living creature. <span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabbi Yosei HaGelili invalidates </span>a bill of divorce written on a living creature.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: An</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> animate object may neither be used as a wall for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, nor as a side post for an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway, nor as </span>one of the upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards </span>surrounding <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">well, nor as the covering of a grave. They said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: Nor may one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> write women’s bills of divorce on it. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the reason for Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s </span>opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the verse: “When a man takes a wife, and marries her, then it comes to pass if she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found some unseemly thing in her; that he write her <span class="gemarra-regular">a scroll </span>of severance and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house” (Deuteronomy 24:1): From the word scroll, <span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span>derived that <span class="gemarra-regular">only a scroll </span>is valid. <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">to include all objects </span>as valid materials upon which a bill of divorce may be written? <span class="gemarra-regular">The Torah states: “That he write her,” in any </span><span class="gemarra-regular">case, </span>i.e., any surface upon which the formula can be written. <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, why does the verse state “scroll</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”? To tell you </span>that a bill of divorce must be written on a surface like a scroll: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a scroll is neither alive nor food, so too, </span>a bill of divorce may be written on <span class="gemarra-regular">any object that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is neither alive nor food. </span>That is why Rabbi Yosei HaGelili invalidates a bill of divorce written on a living being.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how do <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who disagree and say that a bill of divorce may be written even on a living creature or on food, interpret the verse? They contend: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">written: </span>“Let him write for her <span class="gemarra-regular">in the scroll [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">basefer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>indicating the only type of surface on which the bill of divorce may be written? No, <span class="gemarra-regular">scroll [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sefer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is written, which comes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">a mere account of the matters [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sefirot</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">devarim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>is required. In other words, <span class="it-text">sefer</span> is referring not to the surface on which a bill of divorce must be written, but rather to the essence of the bill of divorce. The verse teaches that the bill of divorce must contain particular content.
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what do the Rabbis derive </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">that he write her”? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> required </span>to teach the principle that a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">is divorced</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of writing, </span>i.e, a bill of divorce, <span class="gemarra-regular">and she is not divorced by means of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">money</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> It might have entered your mind to say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>in the verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">leaving </span>marriage, i.e., divorce, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposed to becoming </span>married, i.e., betrothal, then, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">becoming </span>married <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>effected <span class="gemarra-regular">with money, so </span>too, <span class="gemarra-regular">leaving </span>marriage may be effected <span class="gemarra-regular">with money. </span>Therefore, the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us: </span>“That he write for her”; divorce can be effected only with a written bill of divorce.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, from where does he </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">this reasoning,</span> that a woman cannot be divorced with money? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He derives it from </span>the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">A scroll </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of severance, </span>which teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">a scroll, </span>i.e., a written document, <span class="gemarra-regular">severs her </span>from her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">and nothing else</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> severs her </span>from him. 
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis </span>explain that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">A scroll of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> severance, is required </span>to teach that a bill of divorce must be <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter that severs </span>all connection <span class="gemarra-regular">between him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If a man says to his wife: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your bill of divorce, on condition that you will </span>never <span class="gemarra-regular">drink wine, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">on condition that you will never go </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to your father’s house, that is not severance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>the bill of divorce is not valid. If a bill of divorce imposes a condition upon the woman that permanently binds her to her husband, her relationship with her husband has not been completely severed, which is a prerequisite for divorce. If, however, he imposes a condition <span class="gemarra-regular">for the duration </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of thirty days, </span>or any other limited period of time, <span class="gemarra-regular">that is severance, </span>and the bill of divorce is valid, as the relationship will be completely terminated at the end of the thirty-day period. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei HaGelili derives </span>that a condition without a termination point invalidates the divorce <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact that instead of using the term <span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the verse uses the more expanded term <span class="gemarra-italic">keritut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Inasmuch as both terms denote severance, using the longer term teaches us two things: Divorce can be effected only by means of writing and not through money, and divorce requires total severance. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis, they do not derive </span>anything from the expansion of <span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span> to <span class="gemarra-italic">keritut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">a caravan camped in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a valley, </span>i.e., an open space not enclosed by walls, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the travelers <span class="gemarra-regular">enclosed </span>their camp <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>partitions made of the <span class="gemarra-regular">animals’ equipment, </span>e.g., saddles and the like, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may carry inside </span>the enclosed area, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that </span>the resultant partition <span class="gemarra-regular">will be a fence ten handbreadths high, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there will not be breaches </span>in the partition <span class="gemarra-regular">greater </span>than <span class="gemarra-regular">the built </span>segment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Any breach that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> approximately ten cubits </span>wide <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>and does not invalidate the partition <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like an entrance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> However, if one of the breaches is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than </span>ten cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited </span>to carry anywhere in the enclosed area.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It is stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagree about the case where the <span class="gemarra-regular">breached</span> segment of the partition <span class="gemarra-regular">equals the standing </span>portion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: It is permitted </span>to carry within that enclosure. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: It is prohibited.</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: It is permitted. This</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is what the Merciful One taught Moses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> breach the majority </span>of the partition; as long as the greater part is not breached, it is considered a partition. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: It is prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. This is what the Merciful One taught Moses: Circumscribe the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> greater </span>part; if the greater part is not enclosed, it is not a partition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And there will not be breaches </span>in the partition <span class="gemarra-regular">greater </span>than <span class="gemarra-regular">the built </span>segment. Only then would carrying be permitted in the enclosed area. By inference, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the breaches <span class="gemarra-regular">equal the built </span>segment, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted. </span>This presents a difficulty for Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not say: </span>By inference if they <span class="gemarra-regular">equal the built </span>segment, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted; rather, say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: If the built </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than the breach, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted </span>to carry in the enclosed area. 
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>according to that way of understanding the mishna, if the breach <span class="gemarra-regular">equals the built </span>segment, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited? If so, let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>that carrying is permitted, provided that the <span class="gemarra-regular">breaches do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not equal the built </span>segment. It can be inferred from this that if the breaches are greater than the built segment, it is certainly prohibited. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, this poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty </span>to the opinion of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua. 
The Gemara cites a proof to support Rav Pappa’s opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>that which the mishna taught about the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="it-text">sukka</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> roofed his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>metal <span class="gemarra-regular">skewer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or with bed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">posts, </span>both of which are unfit for <span class="it-text">sukka</span> roofing because they are susceptible to ritual impurity, <span class="gemarra-regular">if there is space </span><span class="gemarra-regular">between them, equal to their </span>width, filled with materials valid for <span class="it-text">sukka</span> roofing, the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is valid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Apparently, with regard to roofing, if the valid materials equal the invalid, the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> is valid. Similarly, if the built segment of an enclosure equals the breached segment, it is a valid enclosure for the purpose of carrying on Shabbat. This supports Rav Pappa’s opinion against that of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua.
The Gemara contests this conclusion. <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>It is with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the skewers can be <span class="gemarra-regular">inserted and extracted </span>easily. In other words, the case of the mishna in <span class="it-text">Sukka</span> is not one where there are equal amounts of valid and invalid roofing. It is referring to a case where there is additional space between the skewers, which allows for their easy insertion and removal. Consequently, the space filled by the valid roofing is greater than that filled by the skewers. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it possible </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to be precise? </span>Couldn’t the mishna in <span class="it-text">Sukka</span> be understood as describing a case where the gaps between the skewers equal the width of the skewers? That understanding supports the opinion of Rav Pappa, who maintains that when the valid segment precisely equals the invalid segment, the whole is valid.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami said: </span>This mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one adds </span>roofing, so that the area of the valid roofing is greater than that of the skewers.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>This is referring to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the skewers <span class="gemarra-regular">were placed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">crosswise </span>to the <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should place </span>the valid roofing <span class="gemarra-regular">lengthwise, </span>and similarly, if the skewers were placed <span class="gemarra-regular">lengthwise, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should place </span>the valid roofing <span class="gemarra-regular">crosswise, </span>ensuring that there is more valid than invalid roofing. 
The Gemara seeks to adduce a proof in support of the opinion of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>that which was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> caravan camped in a field, and </span>the travelers <span class="gemarra-regular">surrounded </span>their camp <span class="gemarra-regular">with camels </span>that were made to crouch down, or <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">saddles, </span>

Daf 16a

or <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>saddle <span class="gemarra-regular">cushions [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">avitin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">with wheat sheaves, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">with boards, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">with stalks [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kola</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥ</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one may carry within</span> the enclosed area, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that there is no camel-length</span> gap <span class="gemarra-regular">between one camel and another, or a saddle-length</span> gap <span class="gemarra-regular">between one saddle and another, or a cushion-length</span> gap <span class="gemarra-regular">between one cushion and another. </span>Apparently, from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> it can be understood that if the breach is equal to the standing segment, it is not a valid enclosure. 
The Gemara rejects this conclusion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, too, </span>it is referring to gaps through which the various objects can easily <span class="gemarra-regular">be inserted and extracted, </span>so that the breached segment is in fact slightly greater than that of the standing segment.
The Gemara cites yet another proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>that which was taught in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> in tractate <span class="it-text">Kilayim</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ultimately, you say that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there are three measures for partitions</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> These partitions form a barrier that demarcates between vines and seeds. They are needed to render permitted the sowing of a field with diverse kinds of seeds. In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>partition consisting of boards that are each <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is necessary that there will not be</span> a gap of <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">between this </span>board <span class="gemarra-regular">and that</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, so that a goat would not </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">leap</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> headlong </span>through it unimpeded. If the gap is wider than three handbreadths, i.e., wide enough that a goat can leap through it, the boards are not considered joined and it is not considered a partition. 
In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>partition that consists of boards that are <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">as well as </span>boards <span class="gemarra-regular">from three </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to four </span>handbreadths wide, the gap between the boards may be greater than three handbreadths. Nonetheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is necessary </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that there will not be </span>a gap equal to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">full width </span>of a board <span class="gemarra-regular">between one </span>board <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">next, so that the breached </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">will not equal the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> standing </span>segment. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if the breached </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the standing </span>segment, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited </span>to sow another species, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in the area <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite the standing </span>segment, as the breached segment invalidates the entire partition.
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>partition that consists of boards that are <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">as well as </span>boards <span class="gemarra-regular">from four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">to ten cubits </span>wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is necessary that there not be </span>a gap <span class="gemarra-regular">the full </span>width of a board <span class="gemarra-regular">between one </span>board <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the next, so that the breached </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">will not equal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the standing </span>segment. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if the breached </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">equals the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> standing </span>segment, then in the area <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite the standing </span>segment, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted </span>to sow other species, as there is a partition there; however, in the area <span class="gemarra-regular">facing the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> breached </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited. And if the </span>sum of the <span class="gemarra-regular">standing </span>segments <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than the </span>sum of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> breached </span>segments, sowing other species <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted, even </span>in the area <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite the breached </span>part.
However, if, the partition was <span class="gemarra-regular">breached more than ten </span>cubits, sowing diverse kinds <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited, </span>as a breach of more than ten cubits invalidates the entire partition. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if there were pronged</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stakes stuck </span>in the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">there, and one made them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a braid [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>of straw <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>them in the form of a doorway, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>the stakes were set <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than ten </span>cubits apart, sowing <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted. </span>The form of a doorway renders the partition valid, even if there is a breach wider than ten cubits. 
The Gemara explains how the passage from the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> of tractate <span class="it-text">Kilayim</span> supports the opinion of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, contrary to that of Rav Pappa. <span class="gemarra-regular">In</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> any case, the first clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that if each of the boards that make up the partition is <span class="gemarra-regular">from three to four </span>handbreadths wide, sowing other species is permitted, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that there is not </span>a gap <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> full </span>width of a board <span class="gemarra-regular">between one </span>board <span class="gemarra-regular">and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> next. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation </span>of the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa, </span>who permits carrying when the breach equals the standing segment of the partition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Pappa </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: What </span>does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mean by a gap <span class="gemarra-regular">the full </span>width of a board? It means a gap through which the board could easily be <span class="gemarra-regular">inserted and extracted, </span>which is a gap slightly wider than the board itself. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, it stands to reason, from </span>the fact that the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>later: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the breached </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than the standing </span>segment, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited </span>to sow another species, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in the area <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> standing </span>portion. By inference, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the breached segment <span class="gemarra-regular">equals </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the standing </span>segment, sowing other species <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from here </span>proof for the opinion of Rav Pappa.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that this </span>conclusion <span class="gemarra-regular">is a conclusive refutation </span>of the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son of Rav Yehoshua. </span>The Gemara rejects this: Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to your reasoning, say the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the sum of the standing </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than the sum of the breached </span>segment, sowing other species <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted even </span>in the area <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">breached </span>segment. This clause indicates that if the breached segment <span class="gemarra-regular">equals the standing </span>segment, sowing other species <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited. </span>
The Gemara points out that that analysis of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> leads to the conclusion that <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause poses a difficulty for Rav Pappa’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s </span>opinion; <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause poses a difficulty for </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> latter clause poses no difficulty to Rav Pappa. Since the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first clause taught </span>the expression: If <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>sum of <span class="gemarra-regular">the breached </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than the </span>sum of the <span class="gemarra-regular">standing </span>segment, <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the parallel expression: If <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>sum of the <span class="gemarra-regular">standing </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> greater than </span>the sum of <span class="gemarra-regular">the breached </span>segment, even though the latter formulation is imprecise, as the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies even if the two are equal. 
Similarly, the Gemara explains that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pose a difficulty to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">sought to teach </span>the expression <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">latter clause: </span>If the sum of <span class="gemarra-regular">the standing </span>segments <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> greater than the </span>sum of the <span class="gemarra-regular">breached </span>segments, in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause taught </span>the parallel expression : If the sum of <span class="gemarra-regular">the breached </span>segments <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than </span>the sum of <span class="gemarra-regular">the standing </span>segments, even though this formulation is imprecise, as the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies even if the two are equal. 
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to Rav Pappa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who permits carrying in the case where the breaches equal the standing segments, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> makes sense, as <span class="gemarra-regular">for that</span> reason the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">did not combine </span>the case of boards less than three handbreadths wide with the case of boards three handbreadths wide <span class="gemarra-regular">and teach them </span>in a single clause. According to Rav Pappa, there is a significant difference between the two situations. In a case where the boards are less than three handbreadths wide, the partition is invalid if there is a gap of three handbreadths between one bar and the next. However, if the boards are precisely three handbreadths wide, the partition is valid unless there is a gap of more than three handbreadths between them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, </span>who considers a partition invalid when its breached segments are equal to its standing segments, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">should have combined </span>the case of boards less than three handbreadths wide with the case of boards exactly three handbreadths wide <span class="gemarra-regular">and taught them </span>in the following single clause: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any </span>partition made of boards <span class="gemarra-regular">less than </span><span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths wide <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">necessary that there not be </span>a gap of <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">between one </span>board <span class="gemarra-regular">and another. </span>According to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, if a partition with boards three handbreadths wide is to be valid, the gap must be less than three handbreadths.
The Gemara explains why the two cases were not combined according to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua. It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the disqualification in the first clause is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> similar to the disqualification in the latter clause. </span>The reason for <span class="gemarra-regular">the disqualification in the first clause </span>is because a valid partition must be constructed <span class="gemarra-regular">so that a goat would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>be able <span class="gemarra-regular">to jump </span>through the gap <span class="gemarra-regular">in one</span> leap; the reason for <span class="gemarra-regular">the disqualification in the latter clause</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>where the boards are three handbreadths wide, is <span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that the breached </span>segments <span class="gemarra-regular">will equal the </span>combined <span class="gemarra-regular">standing </span>segments. In practice, just as in the case of boards less than three handbreadths wide, the gap must be less than three handbreadths, so too, in the case of boards three handbreadths wide, the gap must also be less than three handbreadths. However, in terms of underlying reasoning, the case of boards three handbreadths wide must be categorized in the second grouping in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, not the first. Therefore, no proof can be cited from here, neither in support of the opinion of Rav Pappa nor in support of the opinion of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua. 
The Gemara briefly discusses the ruling cited in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> that a breach of <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>handbreadths does not invalidate a partition. In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is that ruling? It is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>In the case of a gap <span class="gemarra-regular">less</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than three </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">we say, </span>i.e., we apply, the principle of <span class="gemarra-italic">lavud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and the partitions are considered joined; however, if the gap is <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span><span class="gemarra-italic">lavud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Say the latter clause </span>with regard to a partition of boards as follows: In the case of any partition whose boards are <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>any partition whose boards are <span class="gemarra-regular">from three to four </span>handbreadths wide, 

Daf 16b

<span class="gemarra-regular">we have arrived at </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon ben Gamliel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who said: </span>Concerning any gap <span class="gemarra-regular">less </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than four </span>handbreadths wide, the principle of <span class="gemarra-italic">lavud</span> is applied. <span class="gemarra-regular">As had </span>it been taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>why does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> list <span class="gemarra-regular">from three</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to four </span>handbreadths as a separate category? In the case of both <span class="gemarra-regular">three and four </span>handbreadths, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is one</span> and the same: The principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span> does not apply from three handbreadths upward.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the first clause is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, the latter clause </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">also be </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis concede that </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any case </span>where the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">permits </span>sowing other species in the area <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite </span>the standing portion, <span class="gemarra-regular">if there is an area of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a significant </span>partition, which permits sowing; <span class="gemarra-regular">and if not, it is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a significant</span> partition and does not permit sowing. Accordingly, there is a difference between a fence of three handbreadths and one of four handbreadths, as even the Rabbis concede that a fence of four handbreadths is more significant.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the latter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">clause is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Gamliel, the first clause </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">also be </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. And when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-italic">lavud</span> in the case of a gap up to four handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">this applies above, </span>off the ground, e.g., in the case of a cross beam suspended at a distance from the wall. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, below, </span>near the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is like a partition through which goats can pass, </span>and therefore he too agrees that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-italic">lavud</span> in that case.
The Gemara returns to the dispute with regard to a breach equal to the standing segments of a partition and cites another proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>that which was taught in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to an area enclosed by <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span><span class="gemarra-regular">walls, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where most of them </span>consist of <span class="gemarra-regular">entrance and windows, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to carry on Shabbat within the area, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that the standing </span>segments <span class="gemarra-regular">are greater </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than the breached </span>segments.
The Gemara analyzes the formulation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Can it enter your mind that </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">most of </span>the walls are entrances and windows? If so, the standing segments are certainly not greater than the breached segments. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>emend the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as follows: Carrying in the area enclosed by these walls, <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which one added </span>many <span class="gemarra-regular">entrances and windows, is permitted, provided </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that the standing </span>segments <span class="gemarra-regular">are greater than the breached </span>segments.
The Gemara draws an inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the standing segments <span class="gemarra-regular">equal the breached </span>segments, carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>in that enclosure. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation </span>of the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Pappa. </span>The Gemara concludes: Indeed, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation. </span>Nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa.</span>
The Gemara wonders: <span class="gemarra-regular">A conclusive refutation and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>that is the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">because the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">precise reading of the mishna is in accordance with </span>the opinion of Rav Pappa. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in the mishna the following phrase: Provided…<span class="gemarra-regular">there will not be breaches </span>in the partition <span class="gemarra-regular">greater </span>than <span class="gemarra-regular">the built </span>segment. This is clearly indicating that if the breached segments are <span class="gemarra-regular">equal to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">built </span>segments, carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted, </span>as maintained by Rav Pappa.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a caravan is camped in a field, and the travelers seek to construct partitions to render the area fit for one to carry within it on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">one surrounds </span>the area with <span class="gemarra-regular">three ropes, one above another, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a third <span class="gemarra-regular">one above </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>two. One is permitted to carry within the circumscribed area <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will not be </span>a gap of <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths between </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">rope and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">next</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The measure of the ropes and their</span> combined <span class="gemarra-regular">thickness </span>must be <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than a handbreadth, so that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the entire </span>partition, consisting of three ropes and the empty spaces between them, <span class="gemarra-regular">will be ten handbreadths </span>high. 
Alternatively, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">surround </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">with boards </span>that stand upright, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that there will not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be </span>a gap of <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths between one board and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the next. </span>
When the Sages issued this ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">they spoke </span>exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">of a caravan; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who maintains that a partition of this kind, which consists of only horizontal or vertical elements, is permitted exclusively in exigent circumstances. Otherwise, full-fledged partitions are required. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, the Rabbis say: They spoke</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a caravan </span>in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>because they spoke <span class="gemarra-regular">in the present</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> citing the most typical case. Those traveling in caravans were typically unable to erect full-fledged partitions, so they would surround their camps with ropes or boards. However, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the mishna applies in all cases. 
The mishna cites an additional dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any partition that is not </span>constructed <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">warp and woof, </span>i.e., vertical and horizontal elements, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not a partition; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda. </span>He holds that the vertical boards and the horizontal ropes are not considered a partition, even in the exigent circumstances of a caravan. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis say: One of the two elements, </span>either vertical or horizontal, is sufficient. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>It was concluded in the previous mishna that the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of a partition that consists only of <span class="gemarra-regular">warp, </span>i.e., vertical, elements, if <span class="gemarra-regular">the standing </span>segment of the partition <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> breached </span>segment, the fence <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">standing. Rav Hamnuna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raised a dilemma: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of a partition that consists only of <span class="gemarra-regular">woof, </span>i.e., horizontal, elements? Is it also considered standing if the standing segment is greater than the breached segment, or not? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear</span> a resolution to this dilemma from the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The measure</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the ropes and their </span>combined <span class="gemarra-regular">thickness </span>must be <span class="gemarra-regular">greater</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than a handbreadth, so that the entire </span>partition <span class="gemarra-regular">will be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ten handbreadths </span>high. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is </span>so that, in a case where the standing segment is greater than the breached segment, the partition is considered standing even in the case of a fence that consists of horizontal elements, <span class="gemarra-regular">why</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do I need </span>ropes with a combined thickness of <span class="gemarra-regular">greater</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than a handbreadth? </span>
Instead, <span class="gemarra-regular">let one leave </span>a space slightly <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">a rope of any</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> size, </span>leave another space slightly <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> place another <span class="gemarra-regular">rope of any size, </span>leave a third space slightly <span class="gemarra-regular">less than four </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>third <span class="gemarra-regular">rope </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">any size. </span>The ropes between which there is a space less than three handbreadths should be considered joined, based on the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span>. The entire partition should be considered standing because the standing segment, measuring six handbreadths, is greater than the breached segment, which measures four handbreadths. 
The Gemara presents a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how can <span class="gemarra-regular">you understand </span>that this would be effective? <span class="gemarra-regular">Where does he position </span>the space of slightly <span class="gemarra-regular">less than four </span>handbreadths? <span class="gemarra-regular">If he positions it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">at the bottom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its </span>legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a partition through which goats pass, </span>which is not a valid partition. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">If he positions it at the top</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">the air on this side, above </span>the uppermost rope, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on that side, </span>below that rope, <span class="gemarra-regular">come and negate it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>As there are more than three handbreadths between them the upper and lower ropes, they are not joined together based on the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span>. The four handbreadths below the uppermost rope and the airspace above it combine to negate the connection. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">If he positions it in the middle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">the standing </span>segment of the partition <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than the breached </span>segment, provided that the standing portions <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the two sides </span>of the breach are combined. However, if each side is considered separately, the breach is greater than the standing portion. If it is nevertheless deemed a partition, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from it </span>that even if <span class="gemarra-regular">the standing </span>segment <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than the breached </span>segment only when the standing segments <span class="gemarra-regular">on the two sides </span>of the breach are combined, the partition is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">standing. </span>However, that circumstance was raised as a dilemma and remained unresolved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Hamnuna raised the following dilemma: </span>What is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one brought a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mat that is seven </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">and any </span>additional amount, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">carved in it </span>a hole <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">and left </span><span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths above the hole <span class="gemarra-regular">and any </span>additional amount below it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and positioned </span>the mat <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>handbreadths off the ground? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma he raised </span>is with regard to the legal status of a ten-handbreadth <span class="gemarra-regular">partition suspended </span>off the ground. That dilemma is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to that which Rabbi Tavla raised </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">a dilemma before Rav: Does a suspended partition </span>act as if it were a partition that reaches the ground and <span class="gemarra-regular">render it permitted </span>for one to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">in a ruin?</span> Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: A suspended partition renders it permitted</span> for one to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>when it is suspended over <span class="gemarra-regular">water, </span>as there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a leniency </span>introduced <span class="gemarra-regular">by the Sages</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to water.</span>
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span> may <span class="gemarra-regular">surround </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">with boards </span>that stand upright, provided there will not be a gap of three handbreadths between one board and the next. Rabbi Yehuda said that this leniency, which allows the establishment of a partition consisting exclusively of horizontal or vertical elements, was stated only with regard to a caravan. The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a caravan, yes, </span>it is permitted; <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> individual, no, </span>it is not permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>unsteady <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions of Shabbat, </span>e.g., those consisting exclusively of horizontal or vertical elements, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">did not permit </span>their use <span class="gemarra-regular">for an individual </span>if the space that they enclose is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> This indicates that, for an area of up to two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, Rabbi Yehuda permits these partitions even for an individual.
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda’s statement in the mishna can be understood <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with that which Rav Naḥman, and some</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai bar Abaye, said </span>with regard to a different statement: This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was necessary only </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to provide </span>those traveling in the caravan with space to satisfy <span class="gemarra-regular">all their needs. Here, too, </span>in the mishna, Rabbi Yehuda’s statement can be understood as coming <span class="gemarra-regular">to provide </span>those traveling in the caravan with space to satisfy <span class="gemarra-regular">all their needs. </span>In other words, Rabbi Yehuda does not dispute the fundamental effectiveness of a partition of this kind, even for an individual. When he says that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies solely to a caravan, he means that it applies only in the case of a caravan, regardless of the size of the area in question. However, in the case of an individual, a partition of that kind is effective only if it encloses an area up to two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was </span>this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Naḥman, and some say </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai bar Abaye, stated? </span>It was stated with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to this </span>ruling at the end of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any partition that is not </span>made of both <span class="gemarra-regular">vertical and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">horizontal </span>elements <span class="gemarra-regular">is not a partition; </span>this is the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda, </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: For <span class="gemarra-regular">both an individual and a caravan, </span>partitions made of <span class="gemarra-regular">ropes </span>are effective? <span class="gemarra-regular">And what, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between an individual and a caravan? </span>With regard to an <span class="gemarra-regular">individual, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">provides him </span>with an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in which he may carry by virtue of partitions of this kind. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span> individuals as well, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">provides them </span>with an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Three </span>individuals <span class="gemarra-regular">assume the </span>legal <span class="gemarra-regular">status of a caravan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">provides </span>each of <span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>with an area of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’</span><span class="it-text">a</span>, for a total of <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">both an individual and </span>those traveling in <span class="gemarra-regular">a caravan, one provides them </span>with space to satisfy <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their needs, provided that there will not be an unoccupied </span><span class="gemarra-regular">space of two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>They may not enclose an area that is two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> larger than the space that they require. Apparently, Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, relies on the ruling that ropes render an area fit for one to carry within it, even for an individual.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥman, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai bar Abaye,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>The opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">was necessary only to provide them </span>with the space to satisfy <span class="gemarra-regular">all their needs </span>in the case of a properly constructed partition consisting of both horizontal and vertical elements. A partition consisting of exclusively horizontal or vertical elements renders an area of six <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> fit for one to carry within it, only in the case of a caravan. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught in the name of Rabbeinu Shmuel: </span>With regard to an <span class="gemarra-regular">individual, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">provides him </span>with an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>individuals, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">provides them </span>with an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">Three </span>individuals <span class="gemarra-regular">assume the </span>legal <span class="gemarra-regular">status </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a caravan, and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">provides </span>each of <span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>with an area of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, for a total of <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>.
Rav Naḥman was asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">abandon </span>the majority opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis and act in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the individual opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman then placed a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">speaker </span>standing <span class="gemarra-regular">over him, and taught: The matters that I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated before you are an error on my part. Indeed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, this </span>is what the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>With regard to an <span class="gemarra-regular">individual,  </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">provides him </span>with an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>individuals,  the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">provides them </span>with an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">Three </span>individuals <span class="gemarra-regular">assume the </span>legal <span class="gemarra-regular">status </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a caravan, and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">provides them </span>with space to satisfy <span class="gemarra-regular">all their needs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 

Daf 17a

The Gemara asks: Is that to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first clause </span>of Rav Naḥman’s ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the latter clause is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis? </span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, because his father, </span>Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with his opinio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> with regard to areas enclosed for the sake of an individual. This being the case, their opinion on this matter is that of the many.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Giddel said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>At times, for <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>people it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited</span> to carry even <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span><span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se</span><span class="it-text">’a</span>; at times, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for them to carry even <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>These statements appear irreconcilable, and his colleagues <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: Did Rav </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say that? He said to them: </span>I swear by <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that Rav said so.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: What is the difficulty </span>here? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is what he is saying: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">they needed six </span><span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they enclosed seven, they are permitted </span>to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">even in </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">seven, </span>as one empty <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> does not render it prohibited for one to carry in the rest of the area. If, however, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">needed only five </span><span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they enclosed seven, </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">even in five is prohibited, </span>as there is an unoccupied space of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teaching, </span>that the partition renders the area fit for one to carry within it <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that there will not be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an unoccupied space of two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what, is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it not </span>in fact referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">space unoccupied by people</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>In other words, isn’t the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaching that the enclosed area may not be two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> larger than a measure of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> per person? Accordingly, if three people enclosed an area of seven <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, it should always be permitted for them to carry there, as they are entitled to six <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> and only one <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> is unoccupied. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">unoccupied by utensils. </span>Although they would be entitled to six <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> if needed, since they need only five in practice and a space of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> remains unoccupied, the effectiveness of the partitions is negated and carrying therein is prohibited.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is stated: </span>If there were <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>people in a caravan <span class="gemarra-regular">and one of them died </span>on Shabbat, or if there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>people, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>others <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">added to them </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna and Rabbi Yitzḥak </span>disagree with regard to the area in which they are permitted to carry on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">One said: Shabbat determines </span>the status of the area. The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is determined in accordance with the prevailing situation at the onset of Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the residents, </span>i.e., the actual number of people present at any given moment, <span class="gemarra-regular">determine </span>the status.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude that it is Rav Huna who said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that Shabbat determines </span>the status, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: I raised </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a dilemma before Rav Huna, and I raised a dilemma </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Yehuda </span>with regard to the following case: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> to join one courtyard to another <span class="gemarra-regular">via </span>a certain <span class="gemarra-regular">opening and that opening was sealed </span>on Shabbat, or if one established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">via </span>a certain <span class="gemarra-regular">window and that window was sealed </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Can one continue to rely on this <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> and carry from one courtyard to the other via other entrances? <span class="gemarra-regular">And he said to me: Since </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted </span>to carry from courtyard to courtyard at the onset of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, it was permitted </span>and remains so until Shabbat’s conclusion.The Gemara comments: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude </span>that it is Rav Huna who maintains the determining factor is Shabbat, not the residents. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that Rav Huna and Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yitzḥak are disagreeing in the </span>earlier <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute of </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span><span class="it-text">’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Yehuda. As we learned </span>in a mishna: If during Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard was breached from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two of its sides, or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">a house was breached</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from two of its sides, or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway’s</span> cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beams or side posts were removed, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to carry within them <span class="gemarra-regular">on that Shabbat, but </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to do so <span class="gemarra-regular">in the future; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted</span> to carry there <span class="gemarra-regular">on that Shabbat, </span>it is also <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted</span> to do so <span class="gemarra-regular">in the future. However, if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry there <span class="gemarra-regular">in the future, </span>it is also <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to do so <span class="gemarra-regular">on that Shabbat. </span>Since it is prohibited to carry there in the future, it is also prohibited to carry there on that Shabbat. This opinion disputes the principle that since it is permitted at the onset of Shabbat it remains permitted.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna who stated </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>and he held that the situation at the onset of Shabbat determines the halakhic status. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak who stated </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei.</span>
The Gemara rejects this explanation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">I who stated </span>my opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">even in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosei. Rabbi Yosei stated </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only there, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are no </span>longer <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions </span>intact; however, <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there are partitions </span>intact. Since the status of the area is dependent upon the existence of partitions, he would also agree that carrying is permitted in this case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yitzḥak </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span> to you: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">I who stated </span>my opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">even in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda stated </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only there, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there are residents. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, there are no </span>remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">residents </span>that are alive, so he too would prohibit carrying. 
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, the Rabbis say: One of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two elements, </span>either vertical or horizontal, is sufficient. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>identical to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the mishna. What did the Rabbis add?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a practical halakhic difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">individual </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a settlement. </span>The first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> does not allow one to rely on a partition of this type <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, whereas the Rabbis permit doing so in all cases.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">exempted</span> a soldier <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a military <span class="gemarra-regular">cam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">four matters: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One may bring wood </span>for kindling <span class="gemarra-regular">from any place </span>with no concern that he is stealing wood from its owners; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one is exempt from </span>ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">washing </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">hands </span>before eating; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one is exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the separation of tithes from <span class="gemarra-regular">doubtfully tithed produce [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>i.e., produce purchased from an <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span>, one who is not diligent in separating tithes; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one is exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">from establishing an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: With regard to a military <span class="gemarra-regular">camp </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that goes out to </span>wage <span class="gemarra-regular">an optional </span><span class="gemarra-regular">war</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>for the soldiers <span class="gemarra-regular">to steal dry wood. Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda ben Teima says: They may also encamp in any </span><span class="gemarra-regular">location</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> even if they damage the field in which they are encamped. <span class="gemarra-regular">And in the place where they were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">killed, there they are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">burie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and the owner of the site cannot object, as moving the corpse for burial elsewhere dishonors the dead. 
The Gemara analyzes this <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>. What is the novelty in the following statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">They are permitted to steal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dry wood? This was an ordinance </span>enacted <span class="gemarra-regular">by Joshua, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master said </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: There is a tradition that <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua stipulated ten condition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> with the Jewish people as they entered Eretz Yisrael, among them <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> graze </span>his animals <span class="gemarra-regular">in woods </span>belonging to others without objection, and one may <span class="gemarra-regular">gather wood </span>for his own use <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their fields.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>Joshua’s ordinance permitted gathering various types of <span class="gemarra-regular">shrubs [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hizmei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thorns [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">higei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> with regard to which people are not particular; <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>the ordinance in the mishna pertaining to a military camp is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">wood. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively: There, </span>Joshua’s ordinance referred <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>gathering thorns still <span class="gemarra-regular">attached </span>to the ground, as removing those thorns benefits the field’s owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>however, the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>gathering thorns that are already <span class="gemarra-regular">detached.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively: There, </span>Joshua’s ordinance referred <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>gathering <span class="gemarra-regular">moist </span>thorns. Owners are not particular about them because they are not immediately suitable for kindling. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>the mishna is referring even <span class="gemarra-regular">to dry </span>thorns.
It was taught in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Teima</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: They may also encamp in any place, and in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the place where they were killed, there they are buried</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara raises a difficulty: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious, </span>as a the body of a dead soldier <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a corpse with no one to bury it [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">met</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>and the principle is that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">met</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> acquires its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> place. </span>In other words, the body must be interred where it is found, and the owner of the field cannot prevent burial.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this ostensibly obvious statement is indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach that this principle applies in the case of a military camp, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though</span>

Daf 17b

<span class="gemarra-regular">there are </span>people available <span class="gemarra-regular">to bury it. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Which is </span>the corpse that is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">met</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Any </span>corpse <span class="gemarra-regular">that has no one </span>available <span class="gemarra-regular">to bury it. </span>If, however, the deceased has friends or relatives to tend to his burial, his corpse is not considered a <span class="it-text">met</span> <span class="it-text">mitzva</span>. Likewise, if the body is in a place where if <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">calls out, others </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">answer him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">met</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> teaches a novel ruling applicable to the case of a military camp: A solider is buried where he was killed, even if the conditions for <span class="it-text">met</span> <span class="it-text">mitzva</span> are not met there.
With regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> itself, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And does a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">met</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">mitzva</span> actually <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire its place? Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who finds a corpse laid out on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a main street evacuates it </span>for burial either <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">right of the street or to the left of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">street, </span>but it may not be buried under the main street itself?
If one can move the corpse either to <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncultivated field or</span> to <span class="gemarra-regular">a plowed field, he evacuates it to the uncultivated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> field. </span>If the choice is between <span class="gemarra-regular">a plowed field and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a sown field, he evacuates it to the plowed field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>fields <span class="gemarra-regular">are plowed, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">both are sown</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">both are uncultivated, he evacuates it to any</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> side that he wishes </span>to move it. Apparently, a <span class="it-text">met</span> <span class="it-text">mitzva</span> is not necessarily buried where it is found. It may be moved elsewhere.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai said: Here we are dealing with a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">corpse laid out across on the side </span>of a public path, and it stretches across the path and reaches the other side. Were the corpse buried there, it would prohibit passage by priests. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since permission was </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">granted to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> evacuate it from the side </span>of a public path, <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may evacuate it to any side he wishes. </span>If, however, the corpse was in a field, moving it would be prohibited.
We learned in the mishna that in a military camp <span class="gemarra-regular">one is exempt from </span>ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">washing </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">hands</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abaye said: They taught </span>this exemption <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">first waters, </span>i.e., hand-washing before eating. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, final waters, </span>i.e., hand-washing after eating and before reciting Grace after Meals, <span class="gemarra-regular">is an obligation </span>even in a military camp. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said: For what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say that the final waters are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an obligation? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the presence of Sodomite salt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which blinds the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eyes </span>even in a small amount. Since Sodomite salt could remain on one’s hands, one must wash them after eating. This obligation is binding even in a camp because soldiers are also obligated to maintain their health. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: And</span> this type of dangerous salt <span class="gemarra-regular">is present </span>in the proportion of a single <span class="gemarra-regular">grain [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">korta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in an </span>entire <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span> of innocuous salt. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ashi: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one measured salt </span>and came into contact with Sodomite salt not during mealtime, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is there an obligation to wash his hands afterward? <span class="gemarra-regular">He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to him: It was unnecessary </span>to say <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>as he is certainly obligated to do so.
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in a military camp, one is exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the separation of tithes from <span class="gemarra-regular">doubtfully tithed produce </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may feed the poor </span><span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>one may also feed <span class="gemarra-regular">quartered soldiers [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">akhsanya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Huna said: </span>A <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may neither feed the poor </span><span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, nor </span>may one feed <span class="gemarra-regular">quartered soldiers </span><span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And Beit Hillel say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may feed the poor </span><span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>one may also feed <span class="gemarra-regular">quartered soldiers </span><span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> in a military camp, one is exempt <span class="gemarra-regular">from establishing an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Sages of <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Rabbi Yannai </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: They taught </span>that this exemption applies <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the joining of </span>houses in <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyards. However, </span>even those in a military encampment <span class="gemarra-regular">are obligated </span>to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> if they desire to effect <span class="gemarra-regular">a joining of Shabbat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whereby one extends the Shabbat limits beyond which one may not walk on Shabbat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Ḥiyya </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One is flogged by Torah law for </span>going beyond the Shabbat limit if there is no <span class="gemarra-regular">joining </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Shabbat boundaries</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Torah states: “No man shall go out [<span class="it-text">al</span> <span class="it-text">yetze</span>] of his place on the seventh day” (Exodus 16:29). Since this is a Torah prohibition, leniency is possible only in life-threatening circumstances.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan strongly objects: Is one flogged for </span>violating <span class="gemarra-regular">a prohibition that is </span>expressed in the Torah with the negative <span class="gemarra-italic">al</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>rather than the negative <span class="it-text">lo</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Ya’akov strongly objects </span>to the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>what you say is <span class="gemarra-regular">so, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: “Turn you not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span><span class="gemarra-italic">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] unto the ghosts, nor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unto </span><span class="gemarra-regular">familiar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spirits” </span>(Leviticus 19:31), is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> there <span class="gemarra-regular">too</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that one is not flogged?</span>
Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">difficulty for Rabbi Yonatan: </span>The prohibition against overstepping the Shabbat limits is <span class="gemarra-regular">a prohibition that was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> given </span>primarily <span class="gemarra-regular">as a warning of court-imposed capital punishment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., a prohibition which, under certain conditions, is punishable by the death and not merely by lashes, as is the case with most prohibitions. In fact, the prohibition against carrying objects out to the public domain is derived from that same verse, and one who violates that prohibition is liable for execution by the court. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this principle applies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any prohibition that was given </span>primarily <span class="gemarra-regular">as a warning </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of court-imposed capital punishment one is not flogged, </span>even if the death penalty does not apply in that particular case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Is it written </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">No </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">shall carry </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yotzi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>indicating a prohibition against carrying objects from one domain to another on Shabbat? <span class="gemarra-regular">“No </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">shall go </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yetze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” is written. </span>Indeed, according to its plain meaning, the verse deals exclusively with the prohibition of going beyond the Shabbat limits and not with the prohibition of carrying out. Everyone agrees that there is no death penalty administered by the court in overstepping the Shabbat limit. 

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may arrange </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">passin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">around a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> in the public domain in order to permit drawing water from the well on Shabbat. A well is usually at least four handbreadths wide and ten handbreadths deep. Therefore, it is considered a private domain, and it is prohibited to draw water from it on Shabbat, as that would constitute a violation of the prohibition to carry from a private domain into a public one. The Sages therefore instituted that a virtual partition may be built in the area surrounding the well, so that the enclosed area could be considered a private domain, thus permitting use of the well and carrying of the water within the partitioned area. 
In this specific instance, the Sages demonstrated special leniency and did not require a proper partition to enclose the entire area. For this purpose, it suffices if there are <span class="gemarra-regular">four double posts [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">deyomadin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] that look </span><span class="gemarra-regular">like eight </span>single posts, i.e., four corner pieces, each comprised of two posts joined together at right angles; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says: </span>There must be <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>posts that <span class="gemarra-regular">look like twelve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> How so? There must be <span class="gemarra-regular">four double posts, </span>one in each corner, with <span class="gemarra-regular">four plain </span>posts, one between each pair of double posts. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The height </span>of the double posts must be at least <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths, their width </span>must be <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">and their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thickness </span>may be even <span class="gemarra-regular">a minimal amount. And between them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., between the posts, there may be a gap <span class="gemarra-regular">the size of two teams [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">revakot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of three oxen</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> each; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>There may be a slightly larger gap, the size of two teams <span class="gemarra-regular">of four</span> oxen each, and this gap is measured with the cows being <span class="gemarra-regular">tied </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">and not untied, </span>and with the minimal space necessary for <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>team to be <span class="gemarra-regular">entering </span>while the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one is leaving.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is permitted to bring </span>the posts <span class="gemarra-regular">closer to the well, provided that </span>the enclosed area is large enough for <span class="gemarra-regular">a cow to </span>stand with <span class="gemarra-regular">its head and the majority of its </span>body <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the partitioned space while <span class="gemarra-regular">it drinks. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>

Daf 18a

<span class="gemarra-regular">to distance </span>the boards from the well and expand the enclosed area by <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount, </span>i.e., as much as one wishes, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that he increases the </span>number of upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards </span>between the double posts. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>The partitioned area may be expanded <span class="gemarra-regular">up to </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is an area of five thousand square cubits.
The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">only spoke of </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a garden or an enclosure </span>used for storing wood, scrap, and the like <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. But if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was a pen [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a stable [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sahar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a backyard, or a courtyard </span>in front of the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if it had an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is permitted. And it is permitted to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">distance </span>the boards and expand the enclosed area <span class="gemarra-regular">by any </span><span class="gemarra-regular">amount, provided that one increases the </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards </span>between the double posts.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mishna is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may arrange</span> upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards around a </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">cistern and ropes around a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> caravan. Ḥananya </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>One may set up <span class="gemarra-regular">ropes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for a cistern, but not </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards.</span>
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even if you say</span> that the mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya, a cistern </span>of collected rain water has a <span class="gemarra-regular">discrete </span>law, as the water will eventually be consumed and the upright boards will become unnecessary; and <span class="gemarra-regular">a well </span>of spring <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span>has a <span class="gemarra-regular">discrete </span>law, as the water is constantly renewed and the upright boards will remain useful.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>a different version of the previous passage: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">does not teach: Ḥananya </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: One may set up ropes around </span>a water <span class="gemarra-regular">cistern </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and boards around a well, by inference, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya, there is no difference between a cistern </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and a well. </span>In both cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">ropes </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed </span>permitted, whereas upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards are not. Let us say the mishna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya.</span>
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you say </span>that the mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya, </span>he was only replying <span class="gemarra-regular">to that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had said; </span>since the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> had spoken only of a cistern, there was no need for Ḥananya to fully clarify his own position and distinguish between a cistern and a well.
The Gemara further suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us say the mishna is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva. As we learned </span>in a mishna: In <span class="gemarra-regular">each of </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">a public well, a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> public cistern, and a private well, one may arrange </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards for them, but </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a private</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cistern, one must establish </span>a proper <span class="gemarra-regular">partition for it ten</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handbreadths high; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Akiva. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Whereas</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here </span>in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches: </span>One may arrange upright boards <span class="gemarra-regular">for a well, </span>from which one may infer that <span class="gemarra-regular">for a well, yes, </span>it is permitted to use posts, but <span class="gemarra-regular">for a cistern, no, </span>it is not permitted. This is opposed to Rabbi Akiva’s opinion, which maintains that posts may be arranged for a public cistern.
The Gemara rejects this argument as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even if you say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">well of spring water, which he </span>can teach in <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">distinct </span>manner because <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no difference </span>whether it belongs to <span class="gemarra-regular">the public and there is no difference </span>whether it belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to an individual, </span>as it is always permitted. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not teach </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern </span>containing <span class="gemarra-regular">collected </span>rain water, <span class="gemarra-regular">which he </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>teach in a <span class="gemarra-regular">distinct </span>manner because there is a difference between a public cistern and a private one. However, it cannot be proven from here that he disagrees with Rabbi Akiva.
The Gemara further suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say the mishna is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Bava, as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Bava says: One may only arrange </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards for a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> public well, whereas here </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">states: For wells. </span>The plural term implies that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no difference </span>if the well belongs to <span class="gemarra-regular">the public, and there is no difference</span> if the well belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to an individual.</span>
The Gemara also rejects this line of reasoning: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even if you say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava, </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the mishna referring when it says <span class="gemarra-regular">wells? </span>It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">wells</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in general, </span>but the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> means to include only public wells.
The mishna had mentioned double posts [<span class="it-text">deyomadin</span>]: The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are </span><span class="gemarra-italic">deyomadin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yirmeya </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Elazar said: Two [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">deyo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] posts [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">amudin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>which are put together to create a single corner piece. 
Having cited Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar’s statement with reference to the prefix <span class="it-text">deyo</span>, the Gemara cites other statements of his. <span class="gemarra-regular">Two, to </span>one who was <span class="gemarra-regular">ostracized, praise, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nourishment, ruin, attribute, three, </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">mnemonic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> for the following statements by Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar.
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned there </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: All inferior figs are exemp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> from being tithed, even if they are of doubtfully tithed produce [<span class="it-text">demai</span>], as even if the seller is an <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span>, he must certainly have already separated tithes from them, since the loss incurred by tithing is negligible, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span><span class="gemarra-italic">deyufra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">deyufra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ulla said: A tree that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> yields two [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">deyo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>harvests <span class="gemarra-regular">of fruit [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">peirot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] each year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Adam </span>was first created with <span class="gemarra-regular">two [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">deyo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] faces, </span>one male and the other female. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: “You have formed me</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> behind and before, </span>and laid Your hand upon me” (Psalms 139:5). Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, which </span>the Lord, God, had taken from the man, <span class="gemarra-regular">He made </span>a woman, and brought her unto the man” (Genesis 2:22). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel </span>disagree over the meaning of the word <span class="it-text">tzela</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One said: </span>It means a female <span class="gemarra-regular">face, </span>from which God created Eve; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one said: </span>Adam was created with <span class="gemarra-regular">a tail [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zanav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which God removed from him and from which He created Eve. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who says </span>that <span class="it-text">tzela</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">face; </span>it is understandable <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is written: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">You have formed me [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzartani</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] behind and before.</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> However, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one who says </span>that <span class="it-text">tzela</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">tail, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>meant by the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You have formed me</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzartani</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] behind and before”?</span>
The Gemara answers that this verse is to be understood as bearing a moral message, <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami, as Rabbi Ami</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Behind </span>means Adam was created at the end of <span class="gemarra-regular">the act of creation; and before </span>means that he was first <span class="gemarra-regular">for punishment.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>it is understandable that Adam was <span class="gemarra-regular">behind, </span>or last, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the act of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">creation, </span>meaning that <span class="gemarra-regular">he was not created until </span>the sixth day, <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat eve. However, before, </span>or first, <span class="gemarra-regular">for punishment, what</span> does <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>mean? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that he was punished first <span class="gemarra-regular">because of the curse </span>pronounced in the wake of the sin involving the Tree of Knowledge, there is a difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t the snake was cursed first, and afterward</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eve was cursed, and </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">at the end was Adam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cursed?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this refers <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the punishment of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Flood, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written: “And He blotted out every living substance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which was upon the face of the ground, both man</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and cattle, </span>creeping things and fowl of the heaven” (Genesis 7:23). This indicates that the punishment began with man.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who said </span>that Eve was originally <span class="gemarra-regular">a face </span>or side of Adam; it is understandable <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is written: </span>“Then the Lord God <span class="gemarra-regular">formed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vayyitzer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>man” (Genesis 2:7). <span class="it-text">Vayyitzer</span> is written with <span class="gemarra-regular">a double </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yod</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one for Adam and one for Eve. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to the one who said</span> that Eve was created from <span class="gemarra-regular">a tail, what is </span>conveyed by spelling <span class="gemarra-italic">vayyitzer</span> with a double <span class="it-text">yod</span>? 
The Gemara responds: This is interpreted homiletically, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon ben Pazi, as Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said: </span>This comes to emphasize that which one says to himself in every circumstance: <span class="gemarra-regular">Woe unto me from my </span>evil <span class="gemarra-regular">inclination [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yetzer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>if I perform the will of my Maker, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> woe to me from my Maker [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Yotzri</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>if I perform the will of my inclination.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who said </span>that Eve was <span class="gemarra-regular">a face, </span>it is understanable <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written: “Male and female, He created them, </span>and blessed them, and called their name Man in the day when they were created” (Genesis 5:2), which indicates that from the very beginning of their creation, He fashioned two faces, one for the male and the other for the female. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the one who said </span>that Eve was created from <span class="gemarra-regular">a tail, what is </span>the meaning of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Male and female, He created them”?</span>
The Gemara answers: It can be explained <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu, as Rabbi Abbahu raised a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> contradiction </span>between the verses: On the one hand <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: “Male and female, He created them,” </span>in the plural, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>on the other hand <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: </span>“So God created man in His own image, <span class="gemarra-regular">for in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> image of God He created him” </span>(Genesis 1:27), in the singular. <span class="gemarra-regular">At first, the thought entered </span>God’s mind <span class="gemarra-regular">to create two, and ultimately, only one was </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">created</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who said </span>that Eve was <span class="gemarra-regular">a face, </span>it is understandable <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is written: </span>“And He took one of his sides <span class="gemarra-regular">and closed up</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the flesh in its place” </span>(Genesis 2:21). <span class="gemarra-regular">However, according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who said </span>that Eve was created from <span class="gemarra-regular">a tail, what is </span>meant by the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> closed up the flesh in its place”?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid said, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yitzḥak: It was necessary </span>to say that the fleshed closed up <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to the place of the incision</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara challenges the other opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that Eve was created from <span class="gemarra-regular">a tail; </span>it is understandable <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is written: “And </span>the Lord God <span class="gemarra-regular">built </span>the <span class="it-text">tzela</span>” (Genesis 2:22), as it was a completely new building. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to the one who said </span>that Eve was a complete <span class="gemarra-regular">face </span>or side, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And He built”? </span>What needed to be built?
The Gemara responds: This must be interpreted homiletically, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya interpreted homiletically </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Lord God built the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.” </span>This verse <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Holy One, Blessed be He, braided for Eve </span>her hair, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">brought her to Adam, as in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> coastal towns, they call braiding </span>hair <span class="gemarra-regular">building. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lord God built,” </span>can be understood as a description of Eve’s basic shape, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said, and some</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say it is taught in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>This verse <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, built Eve </span><span class="gemarra-regular">like the structure </span>

Daf 18b

<span class="gemarra-regular">of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">storehouse. Just as a storehouse is </span>built <span class="gemarra-regular">wide on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bottom and narrow on top, in order to hold produce </span>without collapsing, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too a woman </span>is created <span class="gemarra-regular">wide on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the bottom and narrow on top, in order to hold </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the fetus.</span>
The Gemara cites an exposition of the end of the previously cited verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And brought</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> her unto the man” </span>(Genesis 2:22). This verse <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that the Holy One, Blessed be He, was Adam the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first </span>man’s <span class="gemarra-regular">best man, </span>attending to all his wedding needs and bringing his wife to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">From here </span>we learn <span class="gemarra-regular">that a greater individual should serve as a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">best man for a lesser individual and should not feel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bad </span>about it as something beneath his dignity.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the one who says </span>that Eve was <span class="gemarra-regular">a face </span>or side of Adam, <span class="gemarra-regular">which one of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them walked in front? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is reasonable </span>to say <span class="gemarra-regular">that the male walked in front, </span>as this is proper behavior, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A man should not walk behind a woma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on a path, even if she is his wife. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If she happens </span>upon him <span class="gemarra-regular">on a bridge, he should </span>walk quickly in order to catch up to her and consequently <span class="gemarra-regular">move her to </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">side, </span>so that she will not walk before him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And anyone who walks behind a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a river, </span>where she has to lift up her skirt in order to cross, <span class="gemarra-regular">has no share in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the World-to-Come. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who counts out money for a woman </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from his hand into her hand or from her hand </span><span class="gemarra-regular">into his hand, in order to look upon her, even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>in other matters <span class="gemarra-regular">he is like Moses our teacher, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who received the Torah from Mount Sinai, he will not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be absolved from the punishment of Gehenna. The verse says </span><span class="gemarra-regular">about him: “Hand to hand, the evil man shall not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">go unpunished</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> (Proverbs 11:21). One who hands money from his hand to her hand, even if he received the Torah from God’s hand to his own, like Moses, <span class="gemarra-regular">he will not be absolved from the punishment of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gehenna, </span>which is called evil. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>From the following verse, it is known that Samson’s father, <span class="gemarra-regular">Manoah, was an ignoramus, as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is stated: “And Manoah arose, and went after his wife</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Judges 13:11), which shows that he was unfamiliar with the principle that one must not walk behind a woman.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak strongly objects to this: If that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is so, </span>if the verse relating to Manoah is understood literally, what will one say about the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Elkana, </span>the father of the prophet Samuel, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written: “And Elkana walked after his wife.</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> Does <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>verse mean that Elkana was <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>an ignorant person? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what of the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the prophet <span class="gemarra-regular">Elisha, as it is written: </span>“And the mother of the child said: As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you; <span class="gemarra-regular">and he arose </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and followed her” </span>(ii Kings 4:30). Does <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>verse mean that Elisha was <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>an uneducated person?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>certainly each of these verses means that <span class="gemarra-regular">he followed her words and advice. </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">here too</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the verse concerning Manoah may be similarly interpreted. He did not literally walk behind his wife, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">he followed</span> her <span class="gemarra-regular">words and advice. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: And according to what Rav Naḥman said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Manoah was an ignoramus,  he did not even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">read </span>the basic Torah stories that children learn <span class="gemarra-regular">in school. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “Rebecca arose, and her damsels, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they rode upon the camels, and followed the man” </span>(Genesis 24:61); they followed him and did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>walk <span class="gemarra-regular">before the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> man.</span>
On this topic, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>It is preferable to walk <span class="gemarra-regular">behind a lion, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not behind a woman. </span>And it is preferable to walk <span class="gemarra-regular">behind a woman and not behind idolatry. </span>When a procession honoring idolatry is passing in the street, it is better to walk behind a woman than appear to be accompanying the idolatry. It is preferable to walk <span class="gemarra-regular">behind idolatry and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not behind a synagogue at a time of prayer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> By walking behind a synagogue at a time of prayer and not entering, one appears as though he were denying the God to Whom the congregation is directing its prayers. 
Having cited an aggadic statement of Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar, the Gemara cites other statements of his: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar said: All </span><span class="gemarra-regular">those years during which Adam was ostracized </span>for the sin involving the Tree of Knowledge, <span class="gemarra-regular">he bore spirits, demons, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">female demons</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: “And Adam </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in his own likeness, after his image, </span>and called his name Seth” (Genesis 5:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">By inference, until now, </span>the age of one hundred thirty, <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not bear after his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> image, </span>but rather bore other creatures.
The Gemara raises <span class="gemarra-regular">an objection</span> from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir would say: Adam the first</span> man <span class="gemarra-regular">was very pious. When he saw that death was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> imposed as a punishment because of him, he observed a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fast for a hundred thirty years, and he separated from</span> his <span class="gemarra-regular">wife for a hundred thirty years, and wore belts</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zarzei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of fig </span>leaves <span class="gemarra-regular">on his body </span>as his only garment for <span class="gemarra-regular">a hundred thirty years. </span>If so, how did he father demons into the world?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Rabbi Yirmeya <span class="gemarra-regular">made his statement, </span>he meant that those destructive creatures were formed <span class="gemarra-regular">from the semen that </span>Adam <span class="gemarra-regular">accidentally emitted, </span>which brought the destructive creatures into being.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar</span> further <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>Only <span class="gemarra-regular">some of a person’s praise should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be said in his presence, and all of it </span>may be said <span class="gemarra-regular">not in his presence. </span>Only <span class="gemarra-regular">some of his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> praise should be said in his presence, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: </span>“And the Lord said to Noah, come, you and all your house into the ark, <span class="gemarra-regular">for you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have I seen righteous before Me in this generation” </span>(Genesis 7:1). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And all of it </span>may be said <span class="gemarra-regular">not in his presence, as it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>“These are the generations of Noah; <span class="gemarra-regular">Noah was a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">righteous man, and perfect in his generations, </span>and Noah walked with God” (Genesis 6:9). When not referring to him in his presence, God refers to Noah as a righteous and perfect man.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: </span>“And the dove came in to him in the evening, <span class="gemarra-regular">and lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf, plucked </span><span class="gemarra-regular">off [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">taraf </span><span class="gemarra-regular">]; </span>so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth” (Genesis 8:11)? <span class="gemarra-regular">The dove said before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, let my food be bitter as an olive but given</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into Your hand, and let it not be sweet as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> honey but dependent upon flesh and blood. </span>He adds this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here it is written: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Taraf</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And there it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written: </span>“Remove far from me falsehood and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; <span class="gemarra-regular">feed me [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hatrifeni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] my</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> allotted portion” </span>(Proverbs 30:8).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Any house in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which the words of Torah are heard at night will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> never be destroyed, as it is stated: “But none says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Where is God my Maker, Who gives songs in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> night” </span>(Job 35:10). The verse implies that one who sings songs of Torah in his house at night will not need to lament the destruction of his home.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yirmeya ben Elazar </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">said: From the day that the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Temple was destroyed, it is enough for the world to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>in its praise of God, or in greeting one another with the name of God, only <span class="gemarra-regular">two letters </span>of the Tetragrammaton, namely <span class="it-text">yod</span> and <span class="it-text">heh</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated: “Let everything that has breath praise the Lord [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Yah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">].</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">Halleluya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Psalms 150:6), without mentioning the full name of God, comprised of four letters. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>When <span class="gemarra-regular">Babylonia was cursed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, its neighbors were cursed </span>along with it. When <span class="gemarra-regular">Samaria was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cursed, its neighbors were blessed. </span>He explains: When <span class="gemarra-regular">Babylonia was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cursed, its neighbors were cursed, as it is written: “I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will also make it a possession for wild birds, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pools of water” </span>(Isaiah 14:23), and the arrival of predatory animals brings harm to the surrounding neighbors as well. When <span class="gemarra-regular">Samaria was cursed, its neighbors were blessed, as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written: “Therefore I will turn Samaria into a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">heap of rubble in the field</span>

Daf 19a

<span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">planting vines” </span>(Micah 1:6), which benefits all the surrounding inhabitants.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yirmeya ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Come and see that the attribute of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">flesh and blood is unlike the attribute of the Holy </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One, Blessed be He. </span>For <span class="gemarra-regular">the attribute of flesh and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">blood </span>is to <span class="gemarra-regular">place an </span>iron or wooden <span class="gemarra-regular">hook in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the mouth </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person who was sentenced to death </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by the government, so that he should not </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">curse the king </span>when he is taken away for execution.
But <span class="gemarra-regular">the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be H</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">one is </span>willingly <span class="gemarra-regular">silent </span>when he <span class="gemarra-regular">is sentenced to death by the Omnipresent, as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is stated: “For You silence is praise, </span>O God in Zion, and to You shall the vow be performed” (Psalms 65:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is more, he praises </span>God for his sufferings, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Praise.” And what is more</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it appears to him as though he were offering a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sacrific</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in atonement for his sin, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated: “And to You shall the vow be performed.” </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And this is </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “Those who pass through the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">valley of weeping turn it into a water spring; moreover, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">early</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rain covers it with blessings” </span>(Psalms 84:7)? 
<span class="gemarra-regular"> “Those who pass through [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">overei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” these </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are people who transgress [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">overin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the will of the Holy</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> One, Blessed be He. “Valley [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">emek</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>indicates that their punishment is that <span class="gemarra-regular">Gehenna is deepened [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ma’amikin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] for them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. “Of weeping [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>and “turn it into a water spring [<span class="it-text">ma’ayan</span> <span class="it-text">yeshituhu</span>],” indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">they weep [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bokhin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> make tears flow like a spring [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ma’ayan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the foundations [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shitin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>meaning like a spring that descends to the foundations of the earth. <span class="gemarra-regular">“Moreover, the early rain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">covers it with blessings,” </span>indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">they accept </span>the justice of God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment, and say before Him: Master of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Universe, You have judged properly, You have acquitted properly, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">You have condemned properly, and it is befitting that You </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have prepared Gehenna for the wicked and the Garden of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Eden for the righteous.</span>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Didn’t Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish say: The wicked do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not repent, even at the entrance to Gehenna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is stated: “And they shall go forth, and look</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon the carcasses of the men who rebel against Me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh” (Isaiah 66:24)? The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">does not say: Who rebelled</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but </span>rather: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Who rebel,” </span>in the present tense, meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">they continue rebelling forever.</span>
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult; here, </span>i.e., where it is said that they accept God’s judgment, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the sinners of the Jewish people; there, </span>i.e., where it is said that they do not recant, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the rebels among the nations of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> world.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">So too, it is reasonable</span> to say this, for <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>you do not say <span class="gemarra-regular">so, </span>there would be <span class="gemarra-regular">a contradiction </span>between one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish and </span>another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Reish Lakish. As Reish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lakish said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the sinners of the Jewish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">people, the fire of Gehenna has no power over them, </span>as may be learned by <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> reasoning <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">golden altar. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">If the golden altar </span>in the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">which was only covered by </span>gold <span class="gemarra-regular">the thickness of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a golden dinar, stood for many years and the fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not burn it, </span>for its gold did not melt, so too <span class="gemarra-regular">the sinners of the Jewish people, who are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> filled with good deeds like a pomegranate, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: “Your temples [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">rakatekh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] are like a split pomegranate </span>behind your veil” (Song of Songs 6:7), will not be affected by the fire of Gehenna. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lakish said </span>about this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not read: Your temples </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">rakatekh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], but </span>rather: <span class="gemarra-regular">Your empty ones [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">reikateikh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>meaning that <span class="gemarra-regular">even the sinners among you are full of mitzvot </span><span class="gemarra-regular">like a pomegranate; how much more so </span>should the fire of Gehenna have no power over them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, that which is written: “Those who pass through</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the valley of weeping” </span>(Psalms 84:7), which implies that the sinners nonetheless descend to Gehenna, should be explained as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">There </span>it speaks of <span class="gemarra-regular">those who are liable at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that time </span>for punishment <span class="gemarra-regular">in Gehenna, but our father Abraham</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> comes and raises them up and receives them. </span>He does not leave the circumcised behind and allow them to enter Gehenna, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for a Jew who had relations with a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentile woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in punishment for which <span class="gemarra-regular">his foreskin is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> drawn, and </span>our father Abraham <span class="gemarra-regular">does not recognize </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>as one of his descendants.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana strongly objected to this: Now </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have said </span>that the words <span class="gemarra-regular">those who rebel </span>are referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">those who go on rebelling, if so, </span>in those verses in which <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written of </span>Him: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He Who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brings out” </span>(see Exodus 6:7) <span class="gemarra-regular">and “He Who raises </span><span class="gemarra-regular">up” </span>Israel from Egypt (see Leviticus 11:45), do these expressions mean: <span class="gemarra-regular">He Who is </span>currently <span class="gemarra-regular">raising </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">up and bringing </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">out? Rather, </span>you must understand these terms to mean: <span class="gemarra-regular">He Who </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">raised </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">up and brought </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">out; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here too </span>then, the phrase those who rebel means <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">rebelled. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">There are three entrances to Gehenna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wilderness, one in the sea, and one in Jerusalem. </span>There is one entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">in the wilderness, as it is written </span>with regard to Korah and his company: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all that appertained to them, went down alive into the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pit [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">She’ol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the congregation” (Numbers 16:33).
<span class="gemarra-regular">In the sea </span>there is a second entrance to Gehenna, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written </span>about Jonah in the fish’s belly: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Out of the belly </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the netherworld [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">She’ol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] I cried, and You did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hear my voice” </span>(Jonah 2:3).
And there is a third entrance to Gehenna <span class="gemarra-regular">in Jerusalem, as it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “Says the Lord, Whose fire is in Zion, and Whose</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> furnace is in Jerusalem” </span>(Isaiah 31:9). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Rabbi Yishmael: “Whose fire is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in Zion,” this is Gehenna; and “Whose furnace is in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem,” this is an entrance to Gehenna.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are there no more </span>entrances? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rabbi Maryon say in the name of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Maryon </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught in </span>the name of <span class="gemarra-regular">the school </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: There are two date trees </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the valley of ben Hinnom, and smoke rises from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">between them, </span>and with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>statement about date trees that differ from other palms <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned: The palms </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Har HaBarzel are fit </span>for the mitzva of palm branches [<span class="it-text">lulav</span>], <span class="gemarra-regular">and this is the entrance to Gehenna. </span>The Gemara answers: This is not difficult, for <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps this is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Gehenna has seven</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> names</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they are as follows: She’ol, Avadon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Be’er Shaḥat, Bor Shaon, Tit HaYaven, Tzalmavet, and Eretz</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> HaTaḥtit.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular"> She’ol, as it is written: “Out </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the belly of the netherworld [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">she’ol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] I cried </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and You did hear my voice” </span>(Jonah 2:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">Avadon, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “Shall Your steadfast love be reported </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the grave or Your faithfulness in destruction [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">avadon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]?” </span>(Psalms 88:12). <span class="gemarra-regular">Be’er Shaḥat, as it is written: “For </span><span class="gemarra-regular">You will not abandon my soul to the netherworld; nor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will You suffer Your pious one to see the pit [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">s</span><span class="gemarra-italic">haḥat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Psalms 16:10). <span class="gemarra-regular">And Bor Shaon and Tit HaYaven,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is written: “He brought me up also out</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the gruesome pit [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bor</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">shaon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], out of the miry</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clay [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">hayaven</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Psalms 40:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">And Tzalmavet, as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written: “Such as sat in darkness and in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shadow of death [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzalmavet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>bound in affliction and iron” (Psalms 107:10). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz Taḥtit, </span>i.e., the underworld, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>known by <span class="gemarra-regular">tradition </span>that this is its name.
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are there no more </span>names? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t there </span>the name <span class="gemarra-regular">Gehenna? </span>The Gemara answers that this is not a name rather a description: <span class="gemarra-regular">A valley that is as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> deep as the valley [ </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of </span>ben <span class="gemarra-regular">Hinnom. </span>An alternative explanation is: <span class="gemarra-regular">Into which all descend for vain [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hinnam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>and wasteful <span class="gemarra-regular">acts</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> understanding the word <span class="it-text">hinnam</span> as if it were written <span class="it-text">ḥinnam</span>, meaning for naught.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there </span>also the name <span class="gemarra-regular">Tofte, as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written: “For its hearth [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tofte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is ordained of old” </span>(Isaiah 30:33). The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>name too is a description, meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">that anyone who allows himself to be seduced</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mitpateh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] by his </span>evil <span class="gemarra-regular">inclination will fall there.</span>
Having discussed the entrances to Gehenna, the Gemara also mentions the entrance to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Garden of Eden. Reish Lakish said: If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is in Eretz Yisrael, its entrance is Beit She</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’an, and if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in Arabia, its entrance is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Beit Garem, and if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">between the rivers </span>of Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">its entrance is Dumsekanin, </span>for all these places feature a great abundance of vegetation and fertile land. The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">praise the fruits of the right</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bank </span>of the Euphrates River, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rava </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">praise the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fruits of Harpanya.</span>
The Gemara goes back to the mishna in which we learned: <span class="gemarra-regular">And between them, </span>i.e., between the upright boards and the double posts, there may be a gap <span class="gemarra-regular">the size of two teams </span>of four oxen each, as measured when tied together and not when they are untied. The Gemara asks: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">since the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are tied, we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">know that they are not untied. </span>
The Gemara answers: This is specified, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">tied </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to tied, </span>i.e., close to each other, <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>necessarily that they are <span class="gemarra-regular">actually </span>tied. Therefore, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that it is not enough that they be close; rather, they must be actually tied <span class="gemarra-regular">and not untied</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The mishna continued: There must be sufficient space left so that <span class="gemarra-regular">one can enter and another can leave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>A <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span>that explains the mishna: Enough space so that <span class="gemarra-regular">one team can enter and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">team can</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> leave. Our Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">How much is</span> the length of <span class="gemarra-regular">the head and most of the body</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a cow? Two cubits. And how much is the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thickness of a cow? A cubit and two-thirds of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a cubit, </span>

Daf 19b

<span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>the total width of six oxen <span class="gemarra-regular">is approximately ten </span>cubits; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda said </span>the following, in accordance with his own opinion that the gap may be the size of two teams of four oxen each: The total width is <span class="gemarra-regular">approximately thirteen cubits or approximately fourteen cubits.</span>
The Gemara asks: Why does the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Approximately ten </span>cubits in Rabbi Meir’s statement? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it </span>exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">ten</span> cubits? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since he wanted to teach: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Approximately thirteen, in the last clause, </span>i.e., Rabbi Yehuda’s statement, he therefore also taught: Approximately ten, in the first clause. 
The Gemara asks: But how could he say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Approximately thirteen, </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">it is more? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since he wanted to teach: Approximately fourteen, </span>he therefore also teaches: Approximately thirteen. The Gemara continues this line of questioning: <span class="gemarra-regular">But they are not approximately fourteen, </span>but rather are less. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>It is a third of a cubit <span class="gemarra-regular">more than thirtee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it does <span class="gemarra-regular">not reach fourteen </span>cubits.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span>a water <span class="gemarra-regular">cistern </span>whose own width is <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees, </span>both Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Meir, <span class="gemarra-regular">that there is no need </span>to position <span class="gemarra-regular">upright </span>boards between the double posts. In such a case, the width of the enclosed area, which is the width of the cistern together with the space required for the cows, i.e., two cubits on each side, is twelve cubits. Since the width of each double post is one cubit, the gap between the double posts is ten cubits, and a gap of this size is permitted even according to Rabbi Meir. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to a cistern</span> whose width is <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees that there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a need for upright </span>posts. In this case, even if only two cubits are added on each side for the cows, the enclosed area will be sixteen cubits, and the gap between the double posts will be fourteen cubits, which must be closed off even according to Rabbi Yehuda.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Where they disagree </span>is in the case of a cistern whose width is <span class="gemarra-regular">between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eight </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve </span>cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meir, one must </span>add <span class="gemarra-regular">upright </span>posts, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, one need not </span>add <span class="gemarra-regular">upright </span>posts.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is Rav Pappa teaching </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us? We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that according to Rabbi Meir the gap may not be more than ten cubits, whereas according to Rabbi Yehuda it may be up to thirteen and a third cubits.
The Gemara answers: Indeed, for us nothing new is being taught here; however, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa did not hear </span>this <span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he taught us </span>on his own <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>was taught in the <span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Extended</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, more, in a mound, a barrier of, a courtyard, that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dried up</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> this is a <span class="gemarra-regular">mnemonic </span>containing key words in a series of issues raised by Abaye before Rabba. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised a dilemma before Rabba: </span>If the gaps between the double posts were more than ten cubits, and <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> extended the double posts, </span>that is, he widened each arm of the corner pieces, adding <span class="gemarra-regular">the measure of an upright</span> board, i.e., another cubit, on each side, so that the gaps were no longer more than ten cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the law <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meir? </span>Do we say that this suffices and it is no longer necessary to arrange upright boards between the two double posts, or must upright boards be positioned in the gaps?
Rabba said <span class="gemarra-regular">to him: We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned it </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Provided that he increases </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the boards. Does </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>mean <span class="gemarra-regular">that he extends the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">double posts, </span>increasing them in width? Abaye refutes this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>perhaps it means <span class="gemarra-regular">that he makes more upright </span>boards, increasing them in number.
Rabba said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so, this </span>wording: <span class="gemarra-regular">Provided that he increases the boards, </span>is imprecise, for it implies that one increases the boards themselves, and instead <span class="gemarra-regular">it should have </span>stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">Provided that he increases </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>number of upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards. </span>Abaye answered: There is no need to be particular about this. <span class="gemarra-regular">Teach: Provided that he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">increases </span>the number of upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara cites an alternative version of the previous discussion: <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Abaye as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned it: Provided that he increases the boards. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Does </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>mean <span class="gemarra-regular">that he makes more upright </span>boards, increasing them in number? Abaye refutes this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>perhaps it means <span class="gemarra-regular">that he extends the double posts, </span>increasing them in width.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, it is reasonable </span>to say this, <span class="gemarra-regular">from the fact that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: Provided that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he increases the </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards, </span>which implies that he extends the width of the boards themselves, in accordance with the second version. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from this </span>that this is the correct understanding.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma before Rabba: </span>If the gaps are <span class="gemarra-regular">more than thirteen </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and a third cubits, what </span>is the law <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda? Does he bring upright </span>boards and position them between the double posts, <span class="gemarra-regular">or does he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> extend the double posts, </span>increasing them in width?
Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>the law in a similar case, for it was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span><span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>may the double posts be to the well? They can be <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>close as the length of <span class="gemarra-regular">the head </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and most </span>of the body <span class="gemarra-regular">of a cow. And how </span><span class="gemarra-regular">far </span>may they be from the well? If one wishes, the enclosed area may be expanded <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>to the area of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and even </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>provided that one increases the number of upright boards adequately to keep the gaps under the allowable limit.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>Up to an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is permitted </span>to enclose the area in this manner; but expanding the enclosed area so it is <span class="gemarra-regular">more than </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is prohibited. </span>The other Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rabbi Yehuda: Do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you not agree with regard to a pen, and stable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and a backyard, and a courtyard that even </span>an area <span class="gemarra-regular">of five </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and even of ten </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted </span>for use?
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>There is a significant difference between these cases, for <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one, i.e., the wall surrounding the courtyard and the like, <span class="gemarra-regular">is a </span>proper <span class="gemarra-regular">partition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, whereas these are </span>merely upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards.</span>
The Gemara asks with regard to Rabba’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is so </span>that one extend the double posts, this means that he makes a proper partition of increasingly wider double posts in the area surrounding the well, this is equivalent to the partitions of a courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">should have </span>said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is a partition </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and that is a partition.</span>
The Gemara answers: No proof can be brought from here, for Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying as follows: This </span>one, the walls of a courtyard, are governed by <span class="gemarra-regular">the laws</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a partition, and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">its breaches </span>must not be more than <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">Whereas these, </span>which surround the well, are governed by <span class="gemarra-regular">the laws of </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their breaches </span>may be up to <span class="gemarra-regular">thirteen and a third </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits. </span>Consequently, only an area of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> can be enclosed in this manner. Therefore, no proof can be brought from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to Abaye’s dilemma. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma before Rabba: Can a mound that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rises </span>to a height of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">serve as a double post or can </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it not serve as a double post</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned this </span>in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> square ston</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was present, we see </span>the stone as if it were altered: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wherever it can be divided </span>in such a way that <span class="gemarra-regular">there would remain a cubit here</span> in one direction <span class="gemarra-regular">and a cubit there </span>at a right angle to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">it can serve as a double </span><span class="gemarra-regular">post; but if not, it cannot serve as a double </span><span class="gemarra-regular">post.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a round ston</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was present, we see </span>the stone as if it were altered: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wherever it could be chiseled</span> down into a square, <span class="gemarra-regular">and then divided </span>in such a way that <span class="gemarra-regular">there would remain a cubit here </span>in one direction <span class="gemarra-regular">and a cubit there </span>at a right angle to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">it can serve as a double post; but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if not, it cannot serve as a double post. </span>In any case, it is learned from these two statements that anything can serve as a double post if it is of the requisite size and shape.
With regard to the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> itself, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what do </span>these two <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? </span>The Gemara explains that one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: We see, once. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say: We</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> see, twice. </span>That is to say, while the stone can be considered as if it were divided, it cannot also be considered as though it were chiseled down into a square. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we even say: We see</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> twice. </span>Since a mound is similar to a round stone, it can therefore serve as a double post.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raised </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma before Rabba: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a barrier</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of reeds </span>in the shape of a double post, where <span class="gemarra-regular">each reed is less than three </span>handbreadths apart from the next, so that they are considered connected by the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">can it serve as a double pos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or not?</span>
Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned this </span>law in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that states: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree, or a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fence, or a barrier of reeds was present, it serves</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as a double post. Does </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>refer to a barrier of reeds where <span class="gemarra-regular">each reed is less than three</span> handbreadths from the next?
The Gemara refutes this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it may perhaps refer to <span class="gemarra-regular">a thicket of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reeds </span>planted close together, forming a kind of post. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, it is </span>equivalent to <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree, </span>and the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> would not repeat the same case twice. 
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, then? </span>Would you say that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a barrier of reeds where <span class="gemarra-regular">each reed is less than three </span>handbreadths apart? If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a fence. Rather, what must you say </span>is that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches two types of fence; here </span><span class="gemarra-regular">too, </span>then, you can say that it teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">two types </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of tree, </span>and therefore no proof can be brought from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara cites an alternative version of the previous discussion: <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that the question was posed differently, and the <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma</span> Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">raised before </span>Rabba was about whether or not a dense <span class="gemarra-regular">thicket of reeds </span>can serve as a double post. Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned this </span>law in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree, or a fence, or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a barrier of reeds was present, it can serve as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a double post. Does </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>refer to <span class="gemarra-regular">a thicket</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of reeds?</span>
The Gemara refutes this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it may perhaps refer to a barrier of reeds where <span class="gemarra-regular">each reed is less than three</span> handbreadths apart from the next. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, it is </span>exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">a fence. </span>
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, then</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Would you say that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">a thicket</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of reeds? </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is a tree. Rather, what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must you say </span>is 

Daf 20a

that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">two types of tree; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here too, </span>then, you can say that it teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">types of fence, </span>and therefore no proof can be brought from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Abaye </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">inquired of Rabba: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard, the </span>open <span class="gemarra-regular">end of which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">interposed between the boards </span>surrounding a well, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the law <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to carrying from inside </span>the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards, and from </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the boards into </span>the courtyard? Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: It is permitted. </span>
Abaye then asked him: And if <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>adjacent courtyards interposed between the boards surrounding a well, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the law? Is it permitted to carry from inside them to the area between the boards, and vice versa? Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is prohibited.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>courtyards, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>to carry, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>the residents of the two courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">made an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together. This is because of <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree lest they </span>come to <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is effective for </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards. Rava, </span>however, disagreed and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">made an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>to carry between the courtyards and the area between the boards, and vice versa; with the preparation of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, the two courtyards are regarded as one. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rava: </span>What <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">supports your </span>opinion, for the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard, one end of which interposes between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">board</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> surrounding a well, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to carry from inside </span>the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards, and from </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards into </span>the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>adjacent courtyards, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is prohibited. With regard to which case was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this statement made? </span>The statement applies <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the residents of the two courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">did not make an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together; <span class="gemarra-regular">but if they made an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted</span> to carry between the courtyards and the area between the boards, and vice versa.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is a refutation </span>of the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Huna, </span>for the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> explicitly contradicts his opinion? The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to you: There, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is dealing with a case where the two courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">later became joined </span>by means of the wall that separated them being breached, and it is clear to all that it is a single courtyard, so that there is no concern that people will say that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is effective for the area between the boards.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">asked Rabba </span>yet another question: If <span class="gemarra-regular">the water </span>in the cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">dried up on Shabbat, what is </span>the law? Is it still permitted to carry between the boards? Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: </span>The boards <span class="gemarra-regular">are considered </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">partition only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on account of the water; </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>longer any <span class="gemarra-regular">water here, there is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>longer a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">partition here. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravin raised a dilemma: If the water</span> in the well <span class="gemarra-regular">dried up on Shabbat,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span> the same <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>it rained and other water <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>in its place, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the law? Is the original allowance to carry restored? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: </span>The case where the water <span class="gemarra-regular">dried up on Shabbat should not be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a dilemma for you, for I </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">raised this dilemma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before my Master, </span>Rabba, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he resolved for me </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that it is prohibited to </span>carry in the enclosed area.
The case where other water <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">should also not be a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dilemma for you, for </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> partition erected on Shabbat, and it was </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any partition erected on Shabbat, whether </span>it was erected <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly, or whether intentionally, whether by unavoidable accident, or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whether willingly, it is called </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">partition. </span>The fact that it was erected in a prohibited manner, in violation of prohibitions related to building, does not negate its effectiveness.
Ravin raised a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Was it not stated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard </span>to this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">only taught </span>that such a partition is called a partition as a stringency; it is prohibited by Torah law <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">throw </span>objects from an area enclosed by such a partition into the public domain and vice versa, <span class="gemarra-regular">but to carry </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in it </span>as a full-fledged private domain is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted by the Sages?
The Gemara refutes this objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman’s statement applies </span>only in a case where the partition was erected <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally. </span>Since the partition was erected intentionally on Shabbat, the Sages imposed a penalty that it is prohibited to carry within the enclosed area. However, in the case of a partition that was erected unwittingly or that arose by itself, no such penalty was imposed, and it is permitted to carry there. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One who throws </span>an object from the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">board</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> surrounding a well is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> liable. </span>The Gemara asks: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious, </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">partition, how could he be permitted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to draw </span>water from the well? This shows that it is a full-fledged private domain.
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Elazar’s ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is only necessary </span>to teach that in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one arrange </span>an enclosure <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards surrounding a well in the public domain, </span>in a place where there was no well, <span class="gemarra-regular">and threw </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">into it </span>from the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">liable.</span>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> obvious as well? </span>As, <span class="gemarra-regular">were it not </span>regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> partition in general, how could he be permitted to carry</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is only necessary </span>to teach you that <span class="gemarra-regular">even though </span>such a partition does not bar entry and <span class="gemarra-regular">many </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">pass</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> through it, </span>it is nonetheless considered a partition in regard to Shabbat.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us </span>by this statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">that the </span>passage of <span class="gemarra-regular">many </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">does not come and negate </span>the effectiveness of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">partition? But Rabbi Elazar stated </span>this idea <span class="gemarra-regular">once </span>before.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda says </span>the following with regard to the upright boards surrounding a well: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the path of the public domain </span>passes through the area of the wells and the posts and <span class="gemarra-regular">obstructs them, he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">divert it to the sides</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>or else the partition is invalid. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: He need not </span>divert the path of the public domain, for even if many people pass through there, the partition is valid. With regard to this mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Elazar both said: Here, </span>the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">informed you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the strength of partitions. </span>Therefore, we see that Rabbi Elazar already expressed his opinion that the validity of a partition is not canceled by the passage of many people through it.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it was derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from there </span>alone, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have said </span>that what Rabbi Elazar meant is that <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>the Rabbis informed you of the strength of partitions, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he, </span>Rabbi Elazar, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not agree </span>with them. <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>in his present ruling that what he meant is that <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>they informed you of this law <span class="gemarra-regular">and he agrees </span>with them.
The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>Rabbi Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">say this </span>ruling that one who throws an object into the area enclosed by upright boards is liable, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would not have need to </span>make his <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>comment that here the Rabbis informed you of the strength of partitions. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Elazar did not in fact make two statements, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">one was stated by inference from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> He only made one of these statements explicitly; the other was reported by his students in his name based on an inference from what he had said.
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to bring </span>the upright boards <span class="gemarra-regular">closer to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">well, </span>provided that the enclosed area is large enough for a cow to stand in and drink, with its head and most of its body inside the partitioned space. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned there </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stand in a public domain and drink in the private</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> domain, </span>and likewise he may not stand <span class="gemarra-regular">in the private</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> domain and drink in a public domain, unless he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brings his head and most of his </span>body <span class="gemarra-regular">into the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place where he is drinking. </span>

Daf 20b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the law is <span class="gemarra-regular">likewise in a winepress </span>with respect to tithes. As long as one’s head and most of his body is in the winepress, he may drink from the wine without first separating tithes because drinking wine in a winepress is considered incidental drinking, which does not require tithing. The activity of harvesting and ingathering grapes is not considered completed as long as the grapes are in the winepress, since the grapes are still intended for making wine. Consequently, at this stage one may consume the produce in a casual, incidental manner. Once the work has been completed, however, one must tithe the produce before consuming any of it. 
The Gemara clarifies several laws related to this issue: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to a person</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it was said </span>in connection to these laws <span class="gemarra-regular">that it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is necessary </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">his head and most of his </span>body be inside the domain from which he is drinking. However, a question may be raised <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a cow</span> standing in a public domain and drinking from a private domain, or vice versa: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it necessary </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">its head</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and most of its </span>body be inside the domain from which it is drinking, <span class="gemarra-regular">or not</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wherever </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">holds the bucket </span>from which the cow is drinking <span class="gemarra-regular">but does not hold </span>the animal, there <span class="gemarra-regular">should not be a dilemma for you, </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">its head and most of its </span>body to be <span class="gemarra-regular">inside, </span>as the cow might move backward and pull the bucket with it, causing him to carry it from one domain to the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">Where there should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be a dilemma for you </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">where he holds the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bucket and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>the animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the law in such a case? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>a resolution to this dilemma, for we have learned in the mishna: It is permitted to bring the upright boards closer to the well, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that </span>the enclosed area is large enough for <span class="gemarra-regular">a cow </span>to stand in, with <span class="gemarra-regular">its head and most of its </span>body <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the partitioned space <span class="gemarra-regular">and drink. Does this not </span>refer even to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>the cow <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">holds the bucket? </span>The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this may refer exclusively to the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he holds </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the bucket but does not hold </span>the animal.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">And where he holds the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bucket but does not hold </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it permitted</span> to give his animal to drink in such a fashion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not fill </span>a bucket with <span class="gemarra-regular">water and hold </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">before his animal on Shabbat; but he may fill </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and pour </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">out </span>into a trough, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it, </span>i.e., the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">drinks of its own accord? </span>Consequently, we see that it is prohibited to give an animal to drink from a bucket if he does not hold the animal.
The Gemara refutes this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it stated with regard to this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Here </span>we are dealing with a cow standing inside a house with windows open to the public domain, eating from <span class="gemarra-regular">a manger </span>or trough <span class="gemarra-regular">that stands in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> public domain </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths high and four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide, </span>i.e., it constitutes a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one end </span>of this manger <span class="gemarra-regular">interposes into </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards </span>surrounding a well? 
In such a case, it is prohibited to fill a bucket with water in the area enclosed by the upright boards and hold it before his animal, unless the animal is within the enclosed area. This is a rabbinical <span class="gemarra-regular">decree, lest </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one see that the manger was damaged </span>on the side in the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">and go to fix it, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he might take the bucket with him, </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the private domain to the public domain. </span>Rather, he must pour out the water into the manger, so that it reaches the animal on its own.
The Gemara asks: Even if he carried the bucket into the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">would he be liable in such a case</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Didn’t Rav Safra say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who transfers objects</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from corner to corner </span>in a house, <span class="gemarra-regular">and changed his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mind about them </span>while carrying them <span class="gemarra-regular">and carried them out</span> to the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is exempt because the lifting</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at the first moment was not for that </span>purpose of carrying out to a different domain; when he picked them up, he intended merely to move them around his house. Here too, then, one should not be liable, since when he picked up the bucket he did not intend from the outset to carry it into the public domain; accordingly, there is no room for such a decree. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather,  </span>say that the decree is due to a different concern, that <span class="gemarra-regular">at times one would fix </span>the manger <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">bring </span>the bucket <span class="gemarra-regular">back in again, </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">public domain into the private domain. </span>In this case one picks up the bucket from the outset with the intention of carrying it from a public domain into a private domain. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>a different version of the previous discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to a person, we said that it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sufficient </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">his head and most of his </span>body are inside the domain from which he is drinking. But a question may be raised <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a cow </span>standing in a public domain and drinking from a private domain, or vice versa: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it sufficient </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">its head and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> most of its </span>body are inside the domain from which it is drinking, <span class="gemarra-regular">or not? </span>Perhaps all of the cow must be in that domain.
The Gemara clarifies the question. The case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">holds the bucket </span>from which the cow is drinking <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">should not be a dilemma </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for you, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">enough </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">its head </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and most of its </span>body are in the domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there should be a dilemma for you </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">where he holds the bucket but does not hold </span>the animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in such a case? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>a resolution to this dilemma in the mishna: It is permitted to bring the upright boards closer to the well, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the enclosed area is large enough for <span class="gemarra-regular">a cow </span>to stand in, with <span class="gemarra-regular">its head and most of its </span>body <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the partitioned space, <span class="gemarra-regular">and drink. Doesn’t this</span> refer even to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">holds the bucket</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but does not hold </span>the animal? The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this may refer only to the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he holds the bucket and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>the animal. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, it is reasonable </span>to say this, <span class="gemarra-regular">for if one holds the bucket but does not hold </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to give his animal to drink in such a fashion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not fill </span>a bucket with <span class="gemarra-regular">water and hold </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">before his animal </span>on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">But he may fill </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and pour </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">out </span>into a trough, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">drinks of its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> own accord.</span>
The Gemara refutes this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it stated with regard to this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Here, </span>we are dealing with <span class="gemarra-regular">a manger that stands in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the public domain, </span>and it is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths high and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide, </span>i.e., it constitutes a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one end </span>of the manger <span class="gemarra-regular">interposes into </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards </span>surrounding a well, and the animal is standing at the other end in the public domain. In such a case, it is prohibited to fill a bucket with water in the area enclosed by the boards and hold it before his animal, unless the animal is within the enclosed area. This is a rabbinical decree, lest <span class="gemarra-regular">at times one see that the manger was damaged </span>on the side in the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">and go to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fix it and take the bucket with him, </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the private domain into the public domain. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But would he be liable in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> such a case? Didn’t Rav Safra say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ami said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who transfers objects from corner to corner </span>in a house, <span class="gemarra-regular">and changed his mind about them </span>while carrying them <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> took them out </span>to the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because the lifting at the first moment was not for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>purpose of carrying out to a different domain; when he picked them up, he intended merely to move them around his house. Here too, then, he should not be liable, since when he picked up the bucket he did not intend from the outset to carry it into the public domain; accordingly, there is no room for such a decree.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>we must say that the decree is due to a different concern, that <span class="gemarra-regular">at times one would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fix </span>the manger <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">bring </span>the bucket <span class="gemarra-regular">back in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> again, carrying from the public domain into the private domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>In this case, he picks up the bucket with the intention of carrying it from a public domain into a private domain. In any case, no proof can be brought from this source.
The Gemara cites a different proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A camel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whose head and most of its </span>body <span class="gemarra-regular">are inside </span>a private domain <span class="gemarra-regular">may be force-fed from inside </span>the private domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, force-feeding is like </span>the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds the bucket and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>the animal, as one cannot force-feed an animal without holding it by its neck, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">its head and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">most of its </span>body be inside the domain where it is eating.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Rav Huna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: A camel is different, as since its neck is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">long, </span>its head and most of its body must be inside; otherwise it could stretch its neck into the public domain, and the one feeding it might come to carry the bucket from the private domain into the public domain. In the case of other animals, however, there is no reason for such stringency. 
The Gemara attempts to cite yet another proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">An animal whose </span><span class="gemarra-regular">head and most of its </span>body <span class="gemarra-regular">were inside </span>a private domain <span class="gemarra-regular">may be force-fed from inside </span>the private domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, </span>as stated above, <span class="gemarra-regular">force-feeding is like </span>the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds the bucket and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">its head and most </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of its </span>body be inside the domain where it is eating. The Gemara refutes this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">animal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is taught </span>in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">also a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">camel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">animal </span>in one <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and wasn’t it taught </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">camel </span>in the other <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? The implication is that this law applies not only to camels, but to other animals as well.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Were </span>these two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught next to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> each other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Had both of these <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> been taught together, we would indeed expect the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> not to teach the same law using different formulations. However, since these two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> come from different sources, it is possible that one of the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> referred to a camel with the generic term animal, and hence no proof can be brought from here. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>same idea that a camel is different <span class="gemarra-regular">was also taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer prohibits </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">in the case of a camel, since its neck is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> long.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Adda said: </span>Upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards surrounding wells were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">only permitted to Festival pilgrims</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">boards </span><span class="gemarra-regular">surrounding wells were permitted only for cattle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">cattle </span>mentioned here? It means <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cattle of festival pilgrims. However, a person </span>

Daf 21a

<span class="gemarra-regular">must climb up </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">climb dow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> into the well, and drink there.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? </span>Is the allowance of upright boards for animals alone? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rav Yitzḥak say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>Upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards surrounding </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wells were permitted only </span>where the <span class="gemarra-regular">wells </span>contain potable, running <span class="gemarra-regular">spring water? If </span>the allowance is only <span class="gemarra-regular">for animals, what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">spring </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is </span>the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">collected </span>water? Granted, collected water is inferior to spring water, but it is still suitable for animals to drink. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">We require something that is fit for humans</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara examines the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited in the course of the previous discussion. Returning to <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter itself, </span>the statement quoted above: Upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards surrounding wells were permitted only for cattle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but a person must climb up </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">climb down </span>into the well and drink there. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the wells <span class="gemarra-regular">were</span> too <span class="gemarra-regular">wide </span>for him to climb, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are </span>permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a person as well</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> A person may not fill</span> a bucket with <span class="gemarra-regular">water and hold </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">before his animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat, but he may fill </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and pour </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">out </span>into a trough, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">drinks of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its own accord.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Anan strongly objects to this </span>explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, what purpose do the boards surrounding a well</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> serve? </span>The Gemara immediately expresses its surprise: How can he ask <span class="gemarra-regular">what purpose do they serve? </span>They allow people <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> draw </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the wells, which would otherwise be prohibited.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rav Anan’s question should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">What purpose is served </span>in requiring that the enclosed area be large enough for <span class="gemarra-regular">the cow’s head and most</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of its </span>body, if in any case the cow may not be given to drink straight from the bucket?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>In fact, it is permitted to give the animal to drink in any manner in the area enclosed by the boards surrounding the well. <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a special case, <span class="gemarra-regular">with a manger </span>or trough <span class="gemarra-regular">that stands in the public domain, </span>and is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high and four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide, </span>i.e., it constitutes a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">end of it interposes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards </span>surrounding a well. In such a case, the Sages prohibited one to fill a bucket with water in the area enclosed by the upright boards and hold it before his animal; they were concerned that the manger might become damaged, and one might come to carry the bucket from the private domain into the public domain or vice versa while fixing the damaged manger.
It is prohibited to walk more than two thousand cubits from a city on Shabbat. However, if there are small watchmen’s huts [<span class="it-text">burganin</span>] outside the city that are relatively close together, they are considered part of the city, and consequently the two thousand cubit limit is measured from the last such hut. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>The law with regard to these <span class="gemarra-regular">huts [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">burganin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not apply in Babylonia, nor does </span>the allowance with regard to upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards surrounding a well apply outside </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Eretz </span>Yisrael. 
The Gemara explains: The law with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">huts does not </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">in Babylonia</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because floods are common </span>there; and since the huts are liable to be swept away by the floodwaters, they are not regarded as dwellings. The allowance with regard to upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards surrounding a well does not </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">outside of Eretz</span> Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yeshivot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not common </span>there, and the allowance was only granted to those traveling for the sake of a mitzva such as Torah study. <span class="gemarra-regular">But we do</span> say <span class="gemarra-regular">the opposite, </span>i.e., we apply the law of huts outside of Eretz Yisrael and we apply the allowance of upright boards surrounding a well in Babylonia.
The Gemara cites an alternative version of the previous discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>The laws with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">huts and </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards surrounding a well </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">neither in Babylonia </span>specifically, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor outside of Eretz </span>Yisrael generally. The Gemara explains: The law with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">huts does not apply in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Babylonia, because floods are common </span>there. It <span class="gemarra-regular">also does not</span> apply <span class="gemarra-regular">outside of Eretz </span>Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">because thieves </span>who steal from such huts <span class="gemarra-regular">are common </span>there; therefore, people do not regard the huts as dwellings. 
The allowance with regard to upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards surrounding</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a well </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">in Babylonia, because water is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> common </span>there. Babylonia has many rivers and canals, and therefore wells are not essential there. <span class="gemarra-regular">Outside of Eretz </span>Yisrael in general it <span class="gemarra-regular">also does not </span>apply, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yeshivot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> common </span>there. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said to Marei, son of Rav Huna, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav Yirmeya bar Abba: </span>People <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you walk</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Barnish to Daniel’s synagogue, which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">three parasangs [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">parsei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Upon what do you rely? </span>Do you rely <span class="gemarra-regular">on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> huts </span>located at the city’s outskirts that extend the Shabbat boundary toward the synagogue? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t your father’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> father say in the name of Rav: </span>The law of <span class="gemarra-regular">huts does not </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">in Babylonia?</span>
Marei then <span class="gemarra-regular">went out and showed </span>Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">certain </span>ruins of <span class="gemarra-regular">town</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that were subsumed within </span>a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">seventy cubits and a remainder, </span>two-thirds of a cubit, of each other. He relied upon the ruins, rather than upon the huts, to be permitted to walk the entire distance from Barnish to Daniel’s synagogue.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Mari bar Mar interpreted homiletically: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “I have seen a limit to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">every purpose; but Your commandment is exceedingly broad” </span>(Psalms 119:96)? <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>idea with regard to the breadth of the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated by David, but he did not explain it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> it was <span class="gemarra-regular">stated by Job, but he </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not explain it; </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">stated by Ezekiel, but he</span> also <span class="gemarra-regular">did not explain it, until Zechariah, </span>son of Berechiah, <span class="gemarra-regular">son of Iddo, came and explained it. </span>
Rav Ḥisda explains: This idea was <span class="gemarra-regular">stated by David, but he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not explain it, as it is written: “I have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seen a limit to every purpose; but Your commandment is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exceedingly broad,” </span>i.e., he stated that the Torah is exceedingly broad, but he did not explain how broad. And likewise this idea was <span class="gemarra-regular">stated by Job, but he </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">did not explain it, as it is written: “Its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">measure is longer than the earth and broader than the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sea” </span>(Job 11:9).
And similarly, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">stated by Ezekiel, but he </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">did not explain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it, as it is written: “And He spread it,” </span>the scroll, <span class="gemarra-regular">“before me, and it was written inside and outside</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and in it was written lamentations, and melody [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hegeh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> woe [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vahi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Ezekiel 2:10). 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Lamentations,” this </span>refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">the punishment of the righteou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in this world, and so it is stated: “It is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a lamentation and they shall make lament with it” </span>(Ezekiel 32:16). <span class="gemarra-regular">“And melody [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hegeh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” this </span>refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">the reward </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the righteous in the World-to-Come, and </span>the proof that this word is an expression of joy is the verse that <span class="gemarra-regular">states: </span>“Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the harp, <span class="gemarra-regular">to the melody [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">higayon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lyre” </span>(Psalms 92:4). <span class="gemarra-regular">And “woe [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vahi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” this is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">punishment of the wicked in the World-to-Come, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so it states: “Calamity [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hova</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] shall follow upon calamity” </span>(Ezekiel 7:26). 
But nonetheless, Ezekiel did not explain the extent of the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">until Zechariah, </span>son of Berechiah, <span class="gemarra-regular">son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Iddo, came and explained it, as it is written: “And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he said to me: What do you see? And I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: I see a flying [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">afa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] scroll</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the length </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of it is twenty cubits, and the breadth of it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is ten cubits” </span>(Zechariah 5:2). Since the scroll was flying, the implication is that it had two equal sides, <span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that when you open it, it is twenty by twenty</span> cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written: “And it was written inside</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and outside,” </span>i.e., on both sides. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> peel them apart </span>and separate the two sides, <span class="gemarra-regular">how much</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is it? </span>Its entire area <span class="gemarra-regular">amounts to forty by twenty</span> cubits, or eight hundred of God’s cubits. 
In order to determine the measure of God’s cubit, the Gemara cites a verse that describes the size of the span between God’s thumb and little finger, in a manner of speaking. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written: “Who has measured the waters in the hollow </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of His hand, and meted out heaven with the span,</span> and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure” (Isaiah 40:12). If the entire world measures one square span, which is a quarter of one square cubit, <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">find </span>according to this calculation that <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire world is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>part <span class="gemarra-regular">in three thousand and two hundred of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥisda </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Mari bar Mar interpreted homiletically: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: </span>“The Lord showed me, <span class="gemarra-regular">and behold two baskets of figs were set before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the temple of the Lord, </span>after Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah, son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and the princes of Judah with the craftsmen and the smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. <span class="gemarra-regular">One basket [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] had very good figs, like the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> figs </span>

Daf 21b

<span class="gemarra-regular">that are first ripe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the other basket [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] had very bad figs, so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bad they could not be eaten” </span>(Jeremiah 24:1–2).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Good figs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, these are </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full-fledged righteous </span>people; <span class="gemarra-regular">bad figs, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these are </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full-fledged wicked </span>people. <span class="gemarra-regular">And lest you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say that the hope </span>of the wicked <span class="gemarra-regular">is lost and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their prospect is void, the verse states, </span>interpreting the word <span class="it-text">duda’im</span> homiletically: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The baskets [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">duda’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] yield a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fragrance” </span>(Song of Songs 7:14), meaning that <span class="gemarra-regular">both of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them, </span>the righteous and the wicked, <span class="gemarra-regular">will eventually yield a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fragrance.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">interpreted </span>the verse cited above <span class="gemarra-regular">homiletically </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: </span>“The mandrakes [<span class="it-text">duda</span><span class="it-text">’im</span>] yield a fragrance, and at our doors are all manner of choice fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved” (Song of Songs 7:14)? <span class="gemarra-regular">“The mandrakes [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">duda’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] yield a fragrance,</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these are the young men of Israel who have never</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tasted the taste of sin.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular"> “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And at our doors [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">petaḥeinu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] are all manner of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">choice fruits [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">megadim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” these are the daughters of Israel who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inform [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">maggidot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] their husbands about their passageway [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pit’ḥeihen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>i.e., they tell them when they are menstruating. <span class="gemarra-regular">Another</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> version </span>of this interpretation is: <span class="gemarra-regular">They bind [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ogedot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> passageway </span>and save it <span class="gemarra-regular">for their husbands, </span>and do not have relations with others. 
<span class="gemarra-regular"> “New and old, which I have laid up for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you, O my beloved,” the Congregation of Israel said before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One, Blessed be He, </span>and continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">Master of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Universe, I have decreed many decrees upon myself </span>through the enactments and ordinances of the Sages, <span class="gemarra-regular">more than what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">You decreed upon me </span>in the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fulfilled them. </span>These are the new laws which were added to the old ones stated in the Torah.
It was related that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to one of the Sages who would arrange the </span>traditions of the <span class="gemarra-italic">aggada</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before him: Did you hear what </span>the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">New and old </span>is? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: These, </span>the new, <span class="gemarra-regular">are the </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">lenient mitzvot,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and these, </span>the old, <span class="gemarra-regular">are the </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">stringent mitzvot. </span>
Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>This cannot be so, <span class="gemarra-regular">for was the Torah given on two </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">occasions, </span>i.e., were the more lenient and more stringent mitzvot given separately? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, these, </span>the old, <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>mitzvot <span class="gemarra-regular">from the Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and these, </span>the new, <span class="gemarra-regular">are from the Sages.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava expounded </span>another verse in similar fashion: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span> the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “And more than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> my son, be careful: of making many books</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sefarim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh” (Ecclesiastes 12:12)? <span class="gemarra-regular">My son, be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">careful </span>to fulfill <span class="gemarra-regular">the words of the Sages [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">soferim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">more than the words of the Torah. For the words</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Torah include positive and negative </span>commandments, and even with regard to the negative commandments, the violation of many of them is punishable only by lashes. <span class="gemarra-regular">Whereas </span>with respect to <span class="gemarra-regular">the words of the Sages, anyone who transgresses the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> words of the Sages is liable to </span>receive the <span class="gemarra-regular">death</span> penalty, as it is stated: “And whoever breaches through a hedge, a snake shall bite him” (Ecclesiastes 10:8), taking hedges to refer metaphorically to decrees.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the words of the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">are of substance </span>and have such great importance, <span class="gemarra-regular">why were they not written </span>in the Torah, therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “Of making many books</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there is no end,” </span>meaning that it is impossible to fully commit the Oral Torah to writing, as it is boundless. 
What is the meaning of the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And much study [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lahag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is a weariness of the flesh”</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Pappa, son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Aḥa bar Adda, said in the name of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Ulla: This teaches that whoever mocks [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">malig</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the words of the Sages will be sentenced to boiling </span><span class="gemarra-regular">excrement, </span>which results from the weariness of the flesh of man.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava strongly objects to this </span>explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it written: Mock [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">la’ag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]? “</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Lahag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” is </span>the word that is <span class="gemarra-regular">written. Rather, </span>the verse must be understood in the opposite manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whoever meditates [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hogeh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] upon them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the words of the Sages, <span class="gemarra-regular">experiences </span>enjoyment as if it had <span class="gemarra-regular">the taste of meat.</span>
Concerning the significance of observing the words of the Sages, the Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">It once happened that Rabbi Akiva was incarcerated in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a prison, and Rabbi Yehoshua HaGarsi would </span>come to the prison to <span class="gemarra-regular">attend to his </span>needs. <span class="gemarra-regular">Every day </span>his disciples <span class="gemarra-regular">would bring him water in a measured </span>quantity. <span class="gemarra-regular">One day</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the prison guard met </span>Rabbi Yehoshua HaGarsi and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: </span>The amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">your water today is more </span>than usual; <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps you need </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to </span>soften the walls and thus <span class="gemarra-regular">undermine the prison. He </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">poured </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out half </span>the water, <span class="gemarra-regular">and gave him </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>to take in to Rabbi Akiva. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">came to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Akiva, </span>and the latter saw the small amount of water he had brought, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to him: Yehoshua, do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you not know that I am old, and my life</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> depends on your life? </span>No one else brings me water, so if you bring me less than I need, my life is endangered. 
After Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">related to him the entire incident</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Give me water so that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I may wash my hands. </span>Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The water that I brought <span class="gemarra-regular">will not suffice for drinking</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>how <span class="gemarra-regular">will it suffice for washing your hands? He said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: What can I do; for </span>transgressing the words of the Sages and eating without first washing hands <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is liable to </span>receive the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>penalty. And if so, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">better that I should die my own death</span> by thirst, <span class="gemarra-regular">rather than transgress the opinion of my colleagues</span> who enacted that one must wash hands before eating.
<span class="gemarra-regular">They said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he would not taste anything until </span>Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">brought him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">water and he washed his hands. When the Sages heard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">about this, they said: If in his old age </span>and weakened state he is still <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>meticulous in his observance of the mitzvot, <span class="gemarra-regular">how much more so </span>must he have been <span class="gemarra-regular">in his youth. </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">if in prison </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>scrupulous in his behavior, <span class="gemarra-regular">how much more so </span>must he have been <span class="gemarra-regular">when not in prison.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: At </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the time that </span>King <span class="gemarra-regular">Solomon instituted </span>the ordinances of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> of courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">washing hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to purify them from their impurity, which are added safeguards to the words of the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">a Divine Voice emerged and said </span>in his praise: <span class="gemarra-regular">“My son, if your heart is wise, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">My heart will be glad, even Mine” </span>(Proverbs 23:15). <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it states </span>with regard to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">“My son, be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wise and make My heart glad, that I may respond </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to he who taunts Me” </span>(Proverbs 27:11).
The Gemara cites additional teachings that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava interpreted homiletically: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “Come, my beloved, let us go</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> see if the vine has flowered, if the grape blossoms</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have opened, if the pomegranates are in flower; there will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I give you my loves” </span>(Song of Songs 7:12–13)? 
With regard to the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Come, my beloved, let us go forth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into the field,” the Congregation of Israel said before the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not judge me like those who reside in large cities</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where there is robbery and licentiousness, and vain oaths and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> false oaths, </span>but rather: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Let us go forth into </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the field,” come and I will show You Torah scholars </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>work the land but nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">engage in Torah </span>study, <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>poverty and in <span class="gemarra-regular">distress. </span>
With regard to the words, <span class="gemarra-regular">“Let us lodge in the villages,” do not read </span>the phrase as: <span class="gemarra-regular">In the villages [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bakefarim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], but rather </span>as: <span class="gemarra-regular">By the deniers [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bakoferim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>meaning, <span class="gemarra-regular">come and I will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">show You </span>the nations of the world, <span class="gemarra-regular">whom You showered </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with good, but </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">they have denied You. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular"> “Let us get up</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> early to the vineyards,” these are the synagogues and houses</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of study. “Let us see if the vine has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> flowered,” these are the masters of Bible, </span>who are proficient in the first stage of Torah study. <span class="gemarra-regular">“If the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">grape blossoms have opened,” these are the masters of Mishna. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">“If the pomegranates are in flower,” these are the masters</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Gemara. “There will I give you my loves,” </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">I will show You my glory and my greatness, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> praise of my sons and daughters, </span>how they adhere to sanctity.
The Gemara expounds further concerning King Solomon. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna said: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “And he spoke three </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thousand proverbs, and his poems were a thousand and five” </span>(i Kings 5:12)? This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that Solomon pronounced three thousand</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> proverbs for each and every word of the Torah, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">one thousand and five reasons for each and every word</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Scribes.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “And besides being wise, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Koheleth also taught the people knowledge; and he weighed, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sought out, and set in order many proverbs” </span>(Ecclesiastes 12:9). Rava interpreted homiletically: <span class="gemarra-regular">He taught the people knowledge, </span>meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught it with the accentuation marks </span>in the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> he <span class="gemarra-regular">explained </span>each matter <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of </span>something <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it.</span>
With regard to: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he weighed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">izzen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], and sought </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and set in order many proverbs,” Ulla said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer said: At first the Torah was like </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a basket without handles [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">oznayim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], until Solomon came and made</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handles for it. </span>By means of his explanations and proverbs he enabled each person to understand and take hold of the Torah, fulfill its mitzvot, and distance himself from transgressions.
With regard to the verse, “His head is as the most fine gold, <span class="gemarra-regular">his locks [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kevutzotav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wavy [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">taltalim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>and black as a raven” (Song of Songs 5:11), <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Ukva said: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that it is possible to expound from each and every</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stroke [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kotz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>of the letters in the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">mounds </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upon mounds [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tilei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tilim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of laws. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Black</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sheḥorot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] as a raven [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">orev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>means: <span class="gemarra-regular">In whom </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do you find </span>the words of Torah? <span class="gemarra-regular">In him</span>

Daf 22a

<span class="gemarra-regular">who, for </span>the Torah’s <span class="gemarra-regular">sake, gets up early </span>in the morning [<span class="it-text">shaḥar</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">and stays </span><span class="gemarra-regular">late </span>in the evening [<span class="it-text">erev</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">in the study hall. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: In him who, for </span>the Torah’s <span class="gemarra-regular">sake, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">blackens his face like a raven, </span>i.e., who fasts and deprives himself for the sake of Torah study. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: In him who makes himself cruel to his sons </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">members of his household like a raven </span>for the sake of Torah. This <span class="gemarra-regular">was the case with Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Adda bar Mattana, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>about to <span class="gemarra-regular">go to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> study hall </span>to learn Torah, and <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: What shall I do for your children? </span>How shall I feed them in your absence? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Are all the rushes [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kurmei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the marsh </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">gone? </span>If there is no other bread, let them eat food prepared from rushes. 
The Gemara proceeds to interpret a different verse homiletically: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He repays them that hate Him to His face to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> destroy them; </span>He will not be slack to him that hates Him, He will repay him to his face” (Deuteronomy 7:10). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Were the verse not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written </span>in this manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">be impossible to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">utter it, </span>in deference to God, for it could be understood, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it were</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like a person who bears </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a burden on his face, and wishes to throw it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">off. </span>Written slightly differently, the verse could have been understood as implying that God is unable, as it were, to bear the situation, but must punish the wicked immediately. 
With regard to the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“He shall not be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">slack to him that hates Him,” Rabbi Ila said: He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will not be slack </span>in bringing punishment <span class="gemarra-regular">to him that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hates Him, but He will be slack </span>in rewarding <span class="gemarra-regular">those</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who are absolutely righteous, </span>as the reward of the righteous does not arrive immediately, but only in the World-to-Come.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And that </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">what Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehoshua ben Levi said: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: </span>“And you shall keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments <span class="gemarra-regular">which I command you today</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to do them” </span>(Deuteronomy 7:11)? It means: <span class="gemarra-regular">Today </span>is the time <span class="gemarra-regular">to do them, </span>in this world, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tomorrow </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the time <span class="gemarra-regular">to do them, </span>as there is no obligation or opportunity to fulfill mitzvot in the World-to-Come. Furthermore, it means: <span class="gemarra-regular">Today </span>is the time <span class="gemarra-regular">to do them, </span>but only <span class="gemarra-regular">tomorrow, </span>in the ultimate future, is the time <span class="gemarra-regular">to receive reward for </span>doing <span class="gemarra-regular">them.</span>
In a similar vein, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥaggai said, and some </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: </span>“And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed: The Lord, the Lord, merciful and gracious, <span class="gemarra-regular">long-suffering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">erekh</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">appayim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>and abundant in love and truth” (Exodus 34:6)? Why does it say “<span class="it-text">e</span><span class="it-text">rekh</span> <span class="it-text">appayim</span>,” using a plural form? <span class="gemarra-regular">It should have </span>said <span class="gemarra-italic">erekh</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">af</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>using the singular form.
What this means is that God is long-suffering in two ways: He is <span class="gemarra-regular">long-suffering toward the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">righteous, </span>i.e., He delays payment of their reward; and He is also <span class="gemarra-regular">long-suffering toward the wicked, </span>i.e., He does not punish them immediately. 
The mishna stated that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>The area may be expanded <span class="gemarra-regular">up to </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>an area of five thousand square cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages in clarification of this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did he speak </span>of the area of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cistern </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that enclosed by <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards, </span>that the total area enclosed by the upright boards may be expanded up to, but may not exceed, an area of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps he spoke </span>of the area of <span class="gemarra-regular">the cistern without </span>that enclosed by <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards, </span>that the cistern itself may be expanded up to an area of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>? In that case, the total area enclosed by the boards could exceed an area of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>. 
The underlying rationale of each side of this dilemma is as follows: Does one <span class="gemarra-regular">fix</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his eyes on his cistern, </span>keeping in mind that the partition is made because of it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore, since the area of the cistern is not greater than an area of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not decree lest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he come to carry </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">in an enclosure [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>an enclosed storage space behind the house that was not originally surrounded by a fence for the purpose of residence, even when it is <span class="gemarra-regular">more than </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps a person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fixes his eyes on his partition, </span>and does not pay attention to the cistern, but only to the area enclosed by the partition. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">decree, lest he come to confuse </span>this case <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span> that is <span class="gemarra-regular">larger than </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and come to carry there, because of the similarity between them.
In order to resolve this question, the Gemara cites a proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear</span> what was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">How close </span>may the boards be to the well? They may be <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>close as the length of <span class="gemarra-regular">the head and most </span>of the body <span class="gemarra-regular">of a cow. And how far may they be</span> from the well? The enclosed area may be expanded <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span> to the area of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and even two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>provided that one adds more upright boards or increases their size so as to reduce the size of the gaps between them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>Up to an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is permitted </span>to enclose the area in this manner; <span class="gemarra-regular">more than </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is prohibited.</span>
The other Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rabbi Yehuda: Do you not concede with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to a pen, a stable, a backyard, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard, that even one </span>the size <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">five </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted </span>for use? 
Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>A distinction can be made between the cases, for <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>the wall surrounding the pen, the stable or the yard, is a proper <span class="gemarra-regular">partition, </span>and hence it is permitted to carry in them even if they are more than an area of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">these are </span>only upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards, </span>and they only allow one to carry if the area they enclose is not more than an area of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon ben Elazar says: A cistern </span>the length of <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by </span>the width of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted, and they only said to distance </span>the upright boards from the cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>much as the length of <span class="gemarra-regular">the head and most </span>of the body <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a cow.</span>
The Gemara tries to draw an inference from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar spoke</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">of the cistern </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">and not </span>of the upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards, </span>we can <span class="gemarra-regular">infer </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda spoke of </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">the cistern </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the area enclosed by <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards. </span>The Gemara rejects this argument: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>When <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>said that the area may be expanded up to an area of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was, </span>in fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">speaking of </span>the area of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cistern without </span>that which is enclosed by <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, that is </span>exactly what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar </span>said. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a practical halakhic difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>in a case where the enclosed area is <span class="gemarra-regular">long and narrow. </span>Rabbi Yehuda permits using it, whereas Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar requires that the area be square.
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar stated a principle: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>enclosed <span class="gemarra-regular">space that is used as a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dwelling</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> such as a pen, a stable, a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">backyard, or a courtyard, </span>even if it lacks a roof and <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the structure has the area of <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is permitted </span>to carry in it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any dwelling that is used</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the space </span>outside it, i.e., whose partitions were arranged not so that it could be lived in, but for the sake of the field or yard outside, <span class="gemarra-regular">such</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as field huts, </span>if its area was <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is permitted </span>to carry in it; but if its area was <span class="gemarra-regular">more than two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is prohibited </span>to do so.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: If the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">path of the public domain passes through </span>the area of the upright boards surrounding a well <span class="gemarra-regular">and obstructs </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one must divert </span>the path <span class="gemarra-regular">to the sides, </span>so that the public will circumvent the enclosed area; otherwise, the partition is invalid and the enclosed area cannot be regarded as a private domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: One need not</span> divert the path of the public domain, for the partition is valid even if many people pass through it. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">both said: Here, </span>the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">informed you of the strength </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of partitions; </span>although a path of the public domain passes through the partitions and the partitions do not constitute effective barriers, they are still strong enough to allow one to carry.
The Gemara wishes to clarify the meaning of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: Did he mean <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>that the Rabbis expressed this idea, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he agrees </span>with them that a public thoroughfare does not invalidate a partition? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rabba bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Ḥana say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem, </span>even though it is walled, <span class="gemarra-regular">were it not for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the fact that its doors are locked at night, one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would be liable for </span>carrying in <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>its thoroughfares are regarded <span class="gemarra-regular">as the public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Apparently, Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that a partition is not strong enough to overcome the passage of many people.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement must be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>the Rabbis expressed this idea, although <span class="gemarra-regular">he does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not agree </span>with them.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raised a contradiction between </span>this statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda </span>and another statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, and raised a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> contradiction </span>between this statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>and another statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis.</span>
The other statements are <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one had two houses on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the two sides of the public domain, </span>and he wishes to carry from one house to the other on Shabbat via the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may place a side post </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>perpendicular to the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">side post from here, </span>on the other side of the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>he may place a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here, </span>from one end of one house to the end of the house opposite it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>another cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from here, </span>from the other side of the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">and carry </span>objects <span class="gemarra-regular">and place </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them </span>because the two added partitions turn the area in the middle into a private domain. The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: One cannot make the public domain fit </span>for carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in this manner, </span>i.e., by means of a side post alone, when many people continue to walk through the public thoroughfare in the middle.
Consequently, there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> contradiction between </span>one statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and </span>the other statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and there is also <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> contradiction between </span>one statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis and </span>the other statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis.</span>
The Gemara answers: Between one statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and </span>the other statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no contradiction, </span>because one can differentiate between them. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of the two houses, <span class="gemarra-regular">there are two proper partitions, </span>for the houses are real partitions, and two partitions suffice to establish a separate domain. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of the upright boards, <span class="gemarra-regular">there are not two proper partitions, </span>for the upright boards are not real partitions.
Between one statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>and the other statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">also no contradiction, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to the upright boards, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nominal </span>set <span class="gemarra-regular">of four partitions</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> on all four sides side there are at least two cubits of some form of partition, so the cistern is regarded as enclosed by four partitions. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>with regard to the two houses, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is not a nominal </span>set <span class="gemarra-regular">of four partitions.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosef said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz Yisrael one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not liable for </span>carrying in <span class="gemarra-regular">the public domain. Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Dimi sat and recited this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Abaye said to Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Dimi: What is the reason </span>underlying this ruling? 

Daf 22b

<span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>this law <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">is surrounded by the Ladder </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Tyr</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on one side and the slope of Gade</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the other side, </span>each formation being over ten handbreadths high and constituting a valid partition, then <span class="gemarra-regular">Babylonia, </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">is also surrounded by </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Euphrates </span>River <span class="gemarra-regular">on one side </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Tigris </span>River <span class="gemarra-regular">on the other side, </span>should not be considered a public domain either. Moreover, <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire world </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is also surrounded by the ocean, </span>and therefore there should be no public domain anywhere in the world. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps you spoke of the ascents and descents </span>of Eretz Yisrael, which are not easy to traverse and hence should not have the status of a public domain?
Rav Dimi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Man of great <span class="gemarra-regular">skull, </span>i.e., man of distinction, <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">saw your hea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> between the pillars </span>of the study hall <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rabbi Yoḥanan taught this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>meaning you grasped the meaning as though you actually were present in the study hall and heard the statement from Rabbi Yoḥanan himself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was also</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Ravin came </span>from Eretz Yisrael he <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abbahu </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the ascents and descents of Eretz Yisrael, one is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not liable for </span>carrying in <span class="gemarra-regular">the public domain, because they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not like the banners in the desert. </span>To be regarded as a public domain, a place must be similar to the area in which the banners of the tribes of Israel passed in the desert, i.e., it must be level and suitable for the passage of large numbers of people.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Raḥava raised a dilemma before Rava: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a mound that rises to </span>a height of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">within four </span>cubits, thereby fulfilling the conditions that create a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">but many people traverse it, is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one liable for </span>carrying in <span class="gemarra-regular">the public domain or is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one not liable?</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">should not be a dilemma for you. Just</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as there, </span>with regard to the upright boards surrounding a well, <span class="gemarra-regular">where the use </span>of the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">is convenient</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the Rabbis say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the public does not come and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> invalidate the partition; here, where its use is inconvenient </span>due to the slope, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>should the mound be considered partitioned off as a private domain, and the passage of the public should not invalidate it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Where there should be a dilemma for you </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Does he maintain his position only <span class="gemarra-regular">there, because the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>of the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">is convenient, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its use is inconvenient, </span>he too would agree that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">public does not come and invalidate the partition? Or perhaps </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is no difference? </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Raḥava: In such a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">one is liable </span>for carrying in a public domain. 
Raḥava asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>do you issue this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in the case of a slope that is so steep that in order to climb it <span class="gemarra-regular">one must ascend it by means of a rope? He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to him: Yes. </span>He asked him further: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">even in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the ascents of Beit Meron, </span>which are exceedingly steep? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: Yes.</span>
Raḥava <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection </span>to Rava’s opinion from the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A courtyard </span>that was properly surrounded by partitions, <span class="gemarra-regular">into which many people enter on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>side <span class="gemarra-regular">and exit on that </span>other side, is treated like <span class="gemarra-regular">the public domain </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity, </span>so that in cases of doubt, the person is considered ritually pure, as uncertainty concerning ritual impurity only renders a person impure in an area defined as a private domain; however, it is still treated like <span class="gemarra-regular">the private domain </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat.</span>
He proceeds to clarify the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who</span> is the author of this statement? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>there is a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there, </span>with regard to the upright boards surrounding a well, <span class="gemarra-regular">where the use </span>of the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">is convenient, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis say that the public does not come and invalidate</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the partition; here, </span>in the case of the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its use </span>as a path for a public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inconvenient, all the more so </span>should they say that the passage of many people does not invalidate the partition and therefore there would be no need to discuss this case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda? </span>This indicates that even Rabbi Yehuda differentiates between different paths in the public domain.
Rava replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">No; actually, </span>you can explain that this <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> was taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. </span>As to the question raised with regard to the novelty of this case according to their approach, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was necessary for them </span>to teach us that such a courtyard is treated like <span class="gemarra-regular">the public domain </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to ritual impurity, </span>even though it is considered a private domain with respect to Shabbat. 
Raḥava attempts to cite a proof again, this time from a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the following teaching: <span class="gemarra-regular">Alleyways that open in cisterns, ditches or caves </span>constitute <span class="gemarra-regular">the private domain </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to Shabbat and the public</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> domain </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to ritual impurity.</span>
The Gemara first clarifies the wording of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Should it enter your mind </span>to say that the correct reading is <span class="gemarra-regular">in cisterns [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">baborot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]; </span>is it possible to speak of alleyways that open inside cisterns? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it should be corrected as follows: Alleyways that open out <span class="gemarra-regular">into cisterns [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">laborot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>constitute <span class="gemarra-regular">the private domain </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to Shabbat and the public domain </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to ritual </span><span class="gemarra-regular">impurity.</span>
Raḥava proceeds to clarify the matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the author of this mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, if you say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>there is a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>with regard to the upright boards surrounding a well, <span class="gemarra-regular">where the use </span>of the public thoroughfare <span class="gemarra-regular">is convenient, </span>the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> public does not come and invalidate </span>the partition; <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of an alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">where its use </span>as a public thoroughfare <span class="gemarra-regular">is inconvenient, all the more so </span>should they say that the passage of many people does not invalidate the partition, and so there was no need to discuss this case. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda?</span>
Rava refutes this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">No; actually, </span>you can explain that this mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>It does present a novel teaching, as <span class="gemarra-regular">it was necessary</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for them </span>to teach us that such an alleyway has the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">the public domain </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to ritual</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> impurity. </span>Although it is not a convenient place to cross, it is considered a public domain with respect to impurity, since many people are found there. 
Once again Raḥava attempts to cite a proof from a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the following teaching: <span class="gemarra-regular">The paths of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Gilgul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which are difficult to traverse, <span class="gemarra-regular">and similar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ones </span>have the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">the private domain </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to Shabbat, and </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">the public domain </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to ritual impurity. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>paths <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">the paths of Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gilgul? The school of Rabbi Yannai say: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>path in which <span class="gemarra-regular">a slave [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eved</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is unabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to take</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> up a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of wheat </span>by hand <span class="gemarra-regular">and run</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before an officer [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sardeyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> despite his fear of him.
RaḥavaHe proceeds to clarify the issue: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the author of this mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, if you say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>there is a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>with regard to the upright boards surrounding a well, <span class="gemarra-regular">where the use </span>of the public thoroughfare <span class="gemarra-regular">is convenient, the Rabbis say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the public </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not come and invalidate the partition; here, </span>in the case of the paths of Beit Gilgul, <span class="gemarra-regular">where their use </span>as a public pathway <span class="gemarra-regular">is inconvenient, all the more so </span>should they say that the passage of many people does not invalidate the partitions. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda?</span>
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Did you say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the paths of Beit Gilgul? Joshua, </span>who conquered the land and divided it among the tribes, <span class="gemarra-regular">was a lover of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Israel. He rose up and established roads and highways for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them; any place that was convenient to use he handed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">over to the public, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">any place that was inconvenient </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to use he handed over to an individual</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, the roads of Eretz Yisrael, which like the paths of Beit Gilgul are not easy to use, have the status of a private domain. However, there is no general rule in other places that roads that are difficult to traverse do not have the status of a public domain. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a public cistern </span>containing collected water, <span class="gemarra-regular">as well as a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">public well </span>containing spring water, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">a private well</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, one may arrange </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards around them </span>in order to allow one to carry in the enclosed area, as delineated above. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a private cistern, </span>there are two deficiencies: It belongs to an individual, and it does not contain spring water. Consequently, it is impossible to permit drawing from it on Shabbat by means of boards set up in the corners; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">one must construct for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it a </span>proper <span class="gemarra-regular">partition ten handbreadths high; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> statement of Rabbi Akiva.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: One may arrange </span>upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards only for a public well</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But for the others, </span>that is, a public cistern or a private well, <span class="gemarra-regular">one must set up a belt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a partition consisting of ropes, <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> high. </span>Such an arrangement creates a proper partition based on the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span>, namely, that solid surfaces with gaps between them smaller than three handbreadths are considered joined. 

Daf 23a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava. And Rav Yosef </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>Upright <span class="gemarra-regular">boards </span>surrounding a <span class="gemarra-regular">well were permitted only in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a well</span> containing potable, running <span class="gemarra-regular">spring water. </span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it was necessary </span>to cite both of these statements, even though their content appears to be the same. <span class="gemarra-regular">As had </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>only that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava</span> that upright boards may only be set arranged for a well, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have said </span>that with regard to water belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">the public, </span>upright boards are permitted not only in the case of spring water, but <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in the case of water <span class="gemarra-regular">collected </span>in a cistern. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And that which was taught: </span>One may only arrange boards for <span class="gemarra-regular">a public well, </span>that was <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Akiva </span>that upright boards may be arranged even for a private well, but not to allow us to infer that boards may not be arranged for a public cistern filled with collected water. Therefore, Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">boards </span>surrounding a <span class="gemarra-regular">well were permitted only </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a well of spring water.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in the opposite direction, <span class="gemarra-regular">had </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>that upright boards may only be arranged for <span class="gemarra-regular">a well </span>containing potable, running <span class="gemarra-regular">spring</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> water, I would have said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no difference</span> whether it is a <span class="gemarra-regular">public </span>well <span class="gemarra-regular">and there is no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> difference </span>whether it is a <span class="gemarra-regular">private </span>well. Shmuel therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava, </span>who says that upright boards may be arranged only for a public well, but not for one that belongs to an individual. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a garden or a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>an enclosed courtyard used for storage, <span class="gemarra-regular">that is </span>not more than <span class="gemarra-regular">seventy cubits </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and a remainder, </span>a little more, as will be explained below, <span class="gemarra-regular">by seventy cubits and a remainder, and is surrounded</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by a wall ten handbreadths high, one may carry inside</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it, </span>as it constitutes a proper private domain. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that it contains a watchman’s booth or a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dwelling place, or it is near the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> in which its owner lives, so that he uses it and it is treated like a dwelling.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>This is not necessary, for <span class="gemarra-regular">even if it contains only a </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">cistern, an </span>elongated water <span class="gemarra-regular">ditch, or a cave, </span>i.e., a covered pit containing water, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may carry inside it, </span>as the water bestows upon it the status of a dwelling. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: Even if it has none of thes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> carry inside it, provided that it measures </span>not more than <span class="gemarra-regular">seventy cubits and a remainder by seventy cubits and a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> remainder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: If its length is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">greater than its breadth, even by one cubit, one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not carry inside it, </span>even though its total area does not exceed an area of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, because in an area that was enclosed not for the purpose of residence, carrying is only permitted if the area is perfectly square. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: Even if its length </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is double its breadth, one may carry inside it, </span>and there is no need to be particular about a square shape. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elai </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: I heard from Rabbi Elieze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> that one is permitted to carry in a garden or <span class="it-text">karpef</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the garden <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., thirty times larger than the area of a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>. 
Incidentally, he adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And I also heard from him </span>another <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one of the residents of a courtyard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">forgot and did not join in an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> with the other residents when they established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, and on Shabbat he ceded ownership of his part in the courtyard to the other residents, then it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited for him, </span>the one who forgot to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">to bring in</span> objects <span class="gemarra-regular">or take </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">out </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">his house </span>to the courtyard; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, it is permitted to them, </span>the other residents, to bring objects from their houses to that person’s house via the courtyard, and vice versa. We do not say that the failure of one resident to join in the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> nullifies the validity of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the entire courtyard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And I also heard from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>another <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">that one may fulfill his obligation </span>to eat bitter herbs <span class="gemarra-regular">on Passover with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">arkablin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a certain bitter herb. With regard to all three rulings, <span class="gemarra-regular">I circulated among</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all </span>of Rabbi Eliezer’s <span class="gemarra-regular">disciples, seeking a colleagu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> who had also heard these matters from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">but I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">could not find </span>one.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara first analyzes the wording of this mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">What was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>previously, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>in this mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">furthermore </span>Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava said, which implies a continuation of the previous mishna?
<span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">taught one stringency </span>concerning the upright boards surrounding a well, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he teaches another </span>stringency about an enclosure, and <span class="gemarra-regular">for that reason </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: And furthermore, </span>then there is a difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t Rabbi Yehuda </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">teach one stringency and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>stringency, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not teach: And furthermore </span>Rabbi Yehuda said?
The Gemara answers that the cases are different: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, the Rabbis interrupted </span>Rabbi Yehuda’s statements in order to disagree with him, and hence it is not possible to say: And furthermore Rabbi Yehuda said. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis did not interrupt him, </span>as the two statements of Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava immediately follow one another.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: Does this mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">wherever the </span>disputing <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> interrupt </span>their colleague, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: And furthermore? But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>tractate <span class="gemarra-italic">Sukka</span> (27a), <span class="gemarra-regular">where the Rabbis interrupted his </span>statements, nonetheless the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: And furthermore.</span>
The Gemara answers: It is not the same; <span class="gemarra-regular">there, they interrupted </span>Rabbi Eliezer <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a ruling with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">topic;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">they interrupted </span>Rabbi Yehuda with a ruling with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span>altogether <span class="gemarra-regular">different matter. </span>Consequently, his first statement had already been forgotten, and it is not the Mishna’s style to join together statements where the sequential link between them has already been severed.
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Akiva said: Even </span>if the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">has none of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>elements that indicate dwelling stipulated by the other Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may carry inside it, </span>provided that it measures no more than seventy cubits and a remainder by seventy cubits and a remainder. 

Daf 23b

The Gemara asks: But the view of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the same as that of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava, who maintains that in the case of a garden that was not enclosed for the purpose of residence, one is only permitted to carry if the area of the enclosed area is no more than two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>. Rabbi Akiva disagrees only about whether we require a watchman’s booth or a dwelling place as well, but the two agree with regard to the size of the garden. Therefore, Rabbi Akiva’s stipulation: Provided that it measures not more than seventy cubits and a remainder by seventy cubits and a remainder, is superfluous.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a tiny </span><span class="gemarra-regular">amount. </span>And what is this tiny amount? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>It is by <span class="gemarra-regular">a tiny amoun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> that one of the sides of a square measuring two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">exceeds </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seventy cubits and a remainder, but the Sages did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">give its </span>exact <span class="gemarra-regular">measurement, </span>owing to its small size and because it is impossible to be absolutely precise about the matter.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And what is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>of the area of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> It is as large <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the courtyard of the Tabernacle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which was fifty cubits by one hundred cubits. The first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> and Rabbi Akiva dispute this issue: The first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> maintains that the garden may have an area as large as two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se</span><span class="it-text">’a</span>, whereas Rabbi Akiva says that it must not exceed seventy and two-thirds cubits squared. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are these matters derived? </span>The matters referred to are that we must square the courtyard of the Tabernacle in order to reach the size of garden or similar enclosure in which one is permitted to carry on Shabbat.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: </span>This is learned from <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">stated: “The length of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the courtyard shall be a hundred cubits, and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">breadth fifty by fifty, </span>and the height, five cubits of fine twined linen, and their sockets of brass” (Exodus 27:18). <span class="gemarra-regular">The Torah said: Take </span>a square of <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty </span>cubits by fifty cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">and surround </span>it with the remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty </span>cubits until they form a square, each side of which measures seventy cubits and a remainder.
The Gemara asks: But <span class="gemarra-regular">to what does the plain meaning of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verse refer? </span>The plain sense of the text cannot be coming to teach us the laws of carrying. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said</span> that it means as follows: The Tabernacle was thirty cubits long and ten cubits wide. The courtyard was a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide. <span class="gemarra-regular">Position the Tabernacle </span>in the middle of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">at the edge of fifty</span> cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that there is </span>a space of <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits in front of it, and </span>a space of <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits in every direction, </span>on each of the two sides and behind it. 
We learned in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its length is </span>greater than its breadth, even by one cubit, one may not carry inside it. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: If its length is more than double its breadth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, even by one cubit, one may not carry inside it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai bar Abaye said: When we learned </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the mishna, </span>we <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>learned that it refers to a case where the length of the enclosure is <span class="gemarra-regular">more than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> double its breadth. </span>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, this is </span>the same as the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who stated that one is permitted to carry in the garden or <span class="it-text">karpef</span> even if its length is double its width.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the square that the Sages squared</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> because the Sages calculated squares with the diagonal. According to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, if the diagonal is more than double the breadth, even though the length may not be more than double the breadth, it is prohibited to carry within the enclosure. According to Rabbi Yosei, however, it is permitted (Rabbeinu Ḥananel).
We learned in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span>Even if its length is double its breadth, one may carry inside it. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed on the following matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei. And Rav Beivai said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva.</span>
The Gemara explains that <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>rulings <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">leniently, and </span>that both were <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary. As had </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>only that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would have said </span>that one is not permitted to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>the place <span class="gemarra-regular">contains a watchman’s booth or a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dwelling place, </span>for Rabbi Yosei did not specify that these are not required. Therefore, the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with Rabbi Akiva, </span>who is particular only about the courtyard’s size, but not that it be enclosed for the purpose of residence.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And, </span>on the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">had </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>only that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, I would have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that if the courtyard is <span class="gemarra-regular">long and narrow, </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted to carry. Therefore, the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosei, </span>who clearly states that the courtyard need not be square. 
The Sages taught: Within <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is greater than two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">which was enclosed </span>from the outset <span class="gemarra-regular">for the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> purpose of residence, </span>carrying is permitted regardless of its size; however, if subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">the greater part of it was sown</span> with seed crops, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like a garden, </span>which is not a place of dwelling, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry anything within it.
However, if <span class="gemarra-regular">the greater part</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of it was planted </span>with trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a courtyard, </span>which is a place of dwelling, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>to carry. The reason for this distinction is that the presence of trees does not nullify the status of the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> as a place of residence, because people normally plant trees even in their courtyards. However, people ordinarily plant seed crops only in gardens at some distance from their houses, in places they do not use for dwelling; therefore, the presence of seed crops does nullify the residential status of the <span class="it-text">karpef</span>. 
It was stated above that if <span class="gemarra-regular">the greater part</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was sown </span>with seed crops, it is prohibited to carry in it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehoshua, said: We only said </span>this in a case where the sown section is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but </span>if it is no more than <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion was this stated? It was stated <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: Roofs, courtyards, and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpeifot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one domain with regard to utensils that began Shabbat in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them, </span>even if the utensils belong to different people. Since these are not proper dwelling places, setting an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is unnecessary, and objects may be carried from place to place within them. But they are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>one domain <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to utensils that began Shabbat in the house </span>and that were later taken outside. This shows that the unsown part of a <span class="it-text">karpef</span> and the sown part, which has the status of a garden, are considered a single domain, in which one is permitted to carry, as the garden section does not prohibit the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> section. 
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, since the greater part of </span>the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is sown, the minor </span>part 

Daf 24a

<span class="gemarra-regular">is nullified</span> relative <span class="gemarra-regular">to the greater part, </span>and it is as though the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> were entirely sown. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> greater than two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in which it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if this was stated, this is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what was stated </span>by Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: If the greater part of the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> was sown, it is prohibited to carry within it. It follows that if only a <span class="gemarra-regular">minor </span>part of the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> was sown, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to carry within it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: We said </span>that it is permitted to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if the sown section <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>as large as <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, however, </span>if it is at least <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited </span>to carry anywhere in the <span class="it-text">karpef</span>, even though most of it is not sown.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to whose</span> opinion was this stated? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who disagree with Rabbi Shimon and say that a <span class="it-text">karpef</span> and a courtyard are regarded as separate domains, so that it is prohibited to carry from one to the other.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yirmeya from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Difti would teach </span>this matter <span class="gemarra-regular">as a leniency, </span>as follows: It was stated that if the greater part of the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> was sown, it is prohibited to carry within it. From here it follows that if only a <span class="gemarra-regular">minor </span>part was sown, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>to carry within it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua said: We only said </span>that it is permitted to carry if the sown section is not more than <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">more than two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited </span>to carry. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to whose </span>opinion was this stated? It was <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon.</span>
It was stated earlier that if <span class="gemarra-regular">the greater part of </span>the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was planted </span>with trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like a courtyard, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to carry. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Avimi said: This is</span> only if the trees <span class="gemarra-regular">were planted in rows [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">itztablaot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the customary manner of planting ornamental trees in a courtyard. But if they were arranged differently it is considered an orchard, which is not made for dwelling, and where it is prohibited to carry. <span class="gemarra-regular">But Rav Naḥman said: </span>This applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even if they were not planted in rows, </span>as people commonly plant trees in any arrangement in the courtyards of their houses. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Yehuda happened </span>to come <span class="gemarra-regular">to the house of Rav Huna bar Yehuda, </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> saw certain </span>trees <span class="gemarra-regular">that were not planted in rows, and</span> people <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying among them. </span>Mar Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span> Rav Huna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t the Master hold </span>in accordance <span class="gemarra-regular">with this </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Avimi? </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I hold like </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman, </span>that it is permitted to carry even if the trees are not planted in rows.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is greater </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">which was not enclosed </span>from the outset <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">residence, what should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one do </span>if he wishes to carry within it? <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">should make a breach </span>in the fence <span class="gemarra-regular">larger than ten </span>cubits, which nullifies the partition, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">fence it off </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and reduce </span>the opening <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits, which thereby creates an entrance. He <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to carry in the <span class="it-text">karpef</span>, because it is now regarded as having been enclosed for the purpose of residence.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: </span>If he did not make the breach at once, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">he breached one cubit and fenced off </span>that same <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">breached </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit and fenced </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it off, until he completed </span>the breaching and fencing off of <span class="gemarra-regular">more than ten </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the law?
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: Is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this not as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">All </span>ritually impure wooden <span class="gemarra-regular">utensils belonging to </span>ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">homeowners </span>become ritually pure through breaking the utensil, if they have holes <span class="gemarra-regular">the size </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of pomegranates</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Ḥizkiya raised a dilemma: </span>If a utensil <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perforated </span>with a hole large enough <span class="gemarra-regular">for an olive to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">emerge, and he sealed it, and then it was perforated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">again </span>with a hole large enough <span class="gemarra-regular">for an olive to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">emerge, and he sealed it </span>again, and this went on <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the holes together <span class="gemarra-regular">completed </span>a space large enough for <span class="gemarra-regular">a pomegranate to emerge, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? In other words, is the ruling that because the sum of all the holes is the size of a pomegranate the utensil is pure, or is the ruling that it remains ritually impure because each hole was filled before the next hole was formed?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>his student <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: Master, you taught us </span>that with regard to a <span class="gemarra-regular">sanda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>became ritually impure by impurity imparted by the treading of a <span class="it-text">zav</span>, and <span class="gemarra-regular">one of its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ears, </span>i.e., straps, <span class="gemarra-regular">broke and he repaired it, </span>it remains <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure </span>with impurity imparted by <span class="gemarra-regular">treading [</span><span class="it-text">midras</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> and can still render people and utensils ritually impure. If one of a sandal’s straps is torn, it can still be used as a sandal, and therefore it does not lose its status as a utensil. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">If the </span>second <span class="gemarra-regular">ear </span>broke and he repaired it, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually pure</span> in the sense that it no longer renders other objects ritually impure as would a vessel that became a primary source of ritual impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of </span>impurity imparted by <span class="gemarra-regular">treading</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> However, </span>the sandal itself is <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure </span>due to <span class="gemarra-regular">contact </span>with an object that became ritually impure with impurity imparted by <span class="gemarra-regular">treading, </span>i.e., the sandal before its second strap ripped. Therefore, it can transmit ritual impurity to food and liquids.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And you said about this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is different </span>in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>ear breaks, that the sandal remains impure? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">intact. </span>However, when the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>ear breaks, the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>ear is <span class="gemarra-regular">intact; </span>so how does the sandal lose its utensil status?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">you said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>that the reason it is no longer a utensil is because <span class="gemarra-regular">a new entity has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">arrived here. </span>The legal status of the sandal with the two repaired ears is not that of the original sandal; it is a new sandal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, too, </span>with regard to a utensil that was perforated several times, where the sum of all the holes adds up to the size of a pomegranate, let us say that <span class="gemarra-regular">a new entity has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">arrived here, </span>as the entire area of the hole is completely new, and the utensil is no longer the same utensil that had been ritually impure.
Ḥizkiya was so impressed by Rabbi Yoḥanan’s comment that <span class="gemarra-regular">he exclaimed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">about him: This is not a human being; </span>rather, he is an angel, as he is capable of resolving a problem that I struggle with, from something that I myself taught. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>that he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is an </span>ideal <span class="gemarra-regular">human being. </span>This parallel analysis teaches that if one breached one cubit and fenced it off, breached another cubit and fenced it off, and continued this way until he breached and fenced off more than ten cubits, then this is effective, and he need not breach more than ten meters at once. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana said: A</span> fenced-in <span class="gemarra-regular">yard </span>located <span class="gemarra-regular">behind </span>a group of <span class="gemarra-regular">houses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is used to store objects not in regular use and which measures more than two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, is not treated as a full-fledged private domain. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">inside it, one may carry </span>objects a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman said: If one opened an entrance to it </span>from the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted to carry throughout the entire</span> area, because <span class="gemarra-regular">the entrance permits it, </span>allowing it to be considered as part of the house. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we stated </span>this allowance <span class="gemarra-regular">only where he opened </span>the entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward fenced</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>the area; <span class="gemarra-regular">but if he </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">fenced it in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward opened </span>the entrance, he may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>carry throughout the yard.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: If he first <span class="gemarra-regular">opened </span>the entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward fenced in </span>the area, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that it is permitted to carry throughout the yard, because it is clear that the area was enclosed for the entrance, i.e., in order to use it from the house. The Gemara answers: This ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary only </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> threshing floor </span>in the yard. This is because <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">might have said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he made </span>the entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">with the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">threshing floor in mind, </span>and not so that he would be able to use the entire yard. <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>therefore comes and <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the entrance renders it permitted to carry in the yard in all cases.
The Gemara considers a new case: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span> measuring <span class="gemarra-regular">more than two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which had been enclosed for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">residence but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">became filled with water, </span>by floods or any other cause, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis thought to say </span>that the water <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like seeds. </span>This means that the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> is regarded as if it were sown with seeds, so that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry. It is no longer considered as having been enclosed for the purpose of dwelling, since it is not normal to live in a place filled with water. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Abba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, father of Rav, son of Rav Mesharshiya, said: We say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the name of Rava as follows: Water is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like planted </span>trees, so that one <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>to carry. A courtyard filled with water is still suitable for dwelling, since the water benefits the residents of the courtyard. 

Daf 24b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: This </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">applies only if </span>the water <span class="gemarra-regular">is fit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>its regular <span class="gemarra-regular">use</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., for drinking, because in that case it provides for the needs of residence. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if the water <span class="gemarra-regular">is not fit for use, </span>then it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered like planted trees. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> is no longer considered enclosed for the purpose of residence, and it is prohibited to carry in the <span class="it-text">karpef</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: And </span>even where the water <span class="gemarra-regular">is fit for use, this </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">applies only if</span> the water <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>ten handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">deep </span>over an area <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; but if </span>the water is ten handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">deep </span>over an area <span class="gemarra-regular">greater </span>than <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>to carry in it, as in such a case the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> is no longer considered enclosed for the sake of dwelling. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not so, just as </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pile of fruit, </span>as even if the pile of fruit is very large, the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> does not lose its status as having been enclosed for the purpose of residence. 
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">There was a certain yard in </span>the town of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pum Nahara </span>that was larger than two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> and that had not been enclosed for the purpose of residence. <span class="gemarra-regular">One of its sides opened to </span>an alleyway in <span class="gemarra-regular">the town, and the other opened to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>walled <span class="gemarra-regular">path between the vineyards</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">vineyard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">path led to the bank of a river </span>ten handbreadths high, which is considered a partition. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: What shall we do </span>to permit carrying in the yard, which is a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, without having to make a breach in one of its walls wider than ten cubits and then fence it up again? <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we construct </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a partition for it on the river bank, </span>so that the vineyard path is surrounded by partitions on all sides? This is not a viable solution, as <span class="gemarra-regular">one cannot construct </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span>effective <span class="gemarra-regular">partition on top of another </span>partition that already exists, and the river bank is considered a partition relative to the river.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we arrange a doorframe </span><span class="gemarra-regular">at the mouth of the vineyard path? </span>That is also not an effective solution in this case, for <span class="gemarra-regular">the camels </span>that walk down this path in order to drink water from the river <span class="gemarra-regular">will com</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and knock it over. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Abaye said: We should arrange </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a side post at the opening of the vineyard path </span>to the yard, <span class="gemarra-regular">since as it is effectiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the vineyard path, </span>to allow one to carry on the path, as it is no longer breached into a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is also effective for the yard, </span>and the side post will be considered an additional partition that renders it permitted to carry in the yard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: </span>If so, people <span class="gemarra-regular">will say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a side</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> post is effective </span>in permitting one to carry in <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> vineyard path generally</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and this will cause the public to err, as vineyard paths are usually open at both ends and do not lead to a river or the like.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: They should arrange a side post at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the opening </span>of the yard <span class="gemarra-regular">to the town, as since </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the side post is effective </span>and is considered a partition <span class="gemarra-regular">for the town, it is also effective for the yard, </span>to permit one to carry within it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, </span>in summary, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted to carry</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> within the town itself </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">to carry within the yard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> itself. </span>However, with regard to carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">from the town to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the yard or from the yard to the town, Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Aḥa and Ravina disagree: One prohibits </span>doing so <span class="gemarra-regular">and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> other permits </span>it. 

Daf 25a

<span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">who permits </span>doing so holds that it is permitted since in the yard itself <span class="gemarra-regular">there are no residents, </span>and a place without residents cannot prohibit carrying in another, adjacent domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span>Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">who prohibits </span>doing so holds that it is prohibited because <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes there are residents in i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> who can prohibit carrying in the other domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>unwittingly <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to carry </span>from the yard to the town in their usual manner, even though it is prohibited.
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span> that measures <span class="gemarra-regular">more than two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">that had</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not been fenced in </span>from the outset <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">residence, and one came to reduce it</span>s size, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he reduced it by </span>planting <span class="gemarra-regular">tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in a section of the space, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">reduction</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>because trees are commonly found in a <span class="it-text">karpef</span> designed for dwelling; therefore, they are not considered something out of the ordinary that would reduce its size.
But <span class="gemarra-regular">if he built up a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> column ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high and four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide, it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span>effective <span class="gemarra-regular">reduction</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., if the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> is thereby reduced to the area of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, one is permitted to carry within it. However, if the column is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span>effective <span class="gemarra-regular">reduction. </span>And if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">between three to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four </span>handbreadths wide, there is a dispute between <span class="it-text">amora’im</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: It constitutes an </span>effective <span class="gemarra-regular">reduction, and Rava said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: It does not constitute an </span>effective <span class="gemarra-regular">reduction.</span>
The Gemara explains the two opinions. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it constitutes an </span>effective <span class="gemarra-regular">reduction because </span>it is large enough <span class="gemarra-regular">to be excluded from the principle of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">lavud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>namely, that solid surfaces with gaps between them less than three handbreadths are considered joined. Since the column stands independently, it reduces the size of the <span class="it-text">karpef</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">it does constitute a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">reduction because as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not a place </span>of at least <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not significant. </span>An area of less than four handbreadths is not considered independent. 
It was further stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">If one distanced </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> of the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and erected an </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">partition </span>for the sake of dwelling, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is effective </span>in permitting one to carry in the fenced-off inner area. But if the distance is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not effective, </span>as the new wall is considered attached to the first by means of the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span>, and it is like one partition built on top of another. And if the distance is <span class="gemarra-regular">between three to four </span>handbreadths, that is the topic of the dispute among the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span>, in which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: It is effective, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: It is not effective.</span>
The Gemara explains the two opinions. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: It is effective, as it </span>is far enough away <span class="gemarra-regular">to be removed from the principle of</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lavud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rava </span>disagreed and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: It is not effective, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">because as it is not a place of </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not significant.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Simi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would teach a </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">lenient </span>version of the dispute between Rabba and Rava. <span class="gemarra-regular">If one plastered </span>the walls of a <span class="it-text">karpef </span> larger than two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with plaster</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the plaster <span class="gemarra-regular">can stand on its own, </span>all agree that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is an </span>effective <span class="gemarra-regular">reduction, </span>as it is considered as if he has made a new partition. But if the plaster <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot stand on its own, </span>and it only stays in place because it is attached to the existing wall, there is an amoraic dispute in which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: It is an </span>effective <span class="gemarra-regular">reduction, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not an </span>effective <span class="gemarra-regular">reduction.</span>
The Gemara explains the two opinions. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba says: It is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span>effective <span class="gemarra-regular">reduction, </span>because for <span class="gemarra-regular">now, in any case, it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stands. Rava says: It is not an </span>effective <span class="gemarra-regular">reduction, because</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it cannot stand on its own, it is nothing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., it is insignificant.
<span class="gemarra-regular">If one distanced </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from a mound </span>ten handbreadths high that stands in a <span class="it-text">karpef</span> larger than two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">erected a partition </span>for the sake of dwelling, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is effective </span>to permit one to carry. 
But if he erected the partition <span class="gemarra-regular">less than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> three </span>handbreadths from the mound <span class="gemarra-regular">or on the edge of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the mound </span>itself, so that it is like a partition built on top of another partition, this is a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda and Rav Hamnuna. One </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">said: It is effective, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the other one said: It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not effective.</span>
The Gemara seeks to clarify which of the Sages held which opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude that </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is effective, for it was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed about the following: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one erected a partition on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">top of an </span>existing <span class="gemarra-regular">partition, Rav Ḥisda said: </span>With regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span>e.g., if the first partition was not erected for the purpose of residence, the second partition <span class="gemarra-regular">is effective.</span>
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the property of a convert, he does not acquire</span> it. The property of a convert who dies without heirs is regarded as ownerless unless he had transferred it to someone as a gift during his lifetime. Whoever first implements a valid mode of acquisition upon such property acquires it. For example, one may acquire property by performing an act of taking possession, such as construction of a partition around it. But if one erects a partition around the property of a deceased convert on top of an existing partition, he does not acquire the property in this manner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: Even with regard to Shabbat it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not effective. </span>The Gemara comments: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude </span>that it is Rav Ḥisda who maintains that one partition built on top of another is effective for Shabbat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sheshet agrees with me that if one erected a partition </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on the mound</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> rather than merely adjacent to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is effective </span>to permit one to carry on the mound itself, even though, according to him, it is prohibited to carry in the rest of the <span class="it-text">karpef</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Since he dwells in the space</span> between <span class="gemarra-regular">the upper partitions, </span>he utilizes these new partitions and they serve a function. Although in relation to one positioned below the mound these are partitions built on top of the pre-existing partitions of the mound, and therefore they do not allow him to carry in the <span class="it-text">karpef</span>, they are nonetheless effective in allowing him to carry on the mound itself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana raised a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dilemma: If the lower partitions were swallowed up, </span>e.g., if they sank in boggy ground, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the upper </span>partitions that he had erected still <span class="gemarra-regular">stand, what is </span>the law?
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>issue was this dilemma raised? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it was raised <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to </span>acquiring <span class="gemarra-regular">the property of a convert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is precisely the same as the ruling cited by <span class="gemarra-regular">Yirmeya </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Bira’a, as Yirmeya Bira’a said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one sowed turnip </span>seeds <span class="gemarra-regular">in cracks </span>which he found <span class="gemarra-regular">in land </span>that had belonged to <span class="gemarra-regular">a convert, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another Jew came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">plowed </span>the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">a little, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">latter one, </span>the one who plowed, <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>the property, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the first one does not acquire </span>it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the reason </span>that the first one who sowed the seeds does not acquire the property? <span class="gemarra-regular">At the time that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he sowed, </span>the land <span class="gemarra-regular">was not improved </span>by his sowing. <span class="gemarra-regular">When it did improve, </span>with the growth of the turnips, <span class="gemarra-regular">it improved on its own</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> That is to say, the act of sowing alone is not a sufficiently noticeable action that changes and improves the property at the time. Although the sowing later proves to have been beneficial, this is seen as an improvement of the land that comes on its own. Therefore, an action that will only provide benefit in the future cannot serve as an act of acquisition. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>you must say that the dilemma was raised <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">respect to Shabbat, </span>in which case it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a partition </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that was made on Shabbat; </span>beforehand it was not a valid partition, and the upper ones acquired the status of a partition only after the lower partitions sank into the ground. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it was </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> partition made on Shabbat, whether unwittingly or intentionally, is called</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">partition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Consequently, the upper partitions should be regarded as valid partitions that allow one to carry in the <span class="it-text">karpef</span>. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it stated about this </span>law that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>that such a partition is called a partition <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>as a stringency, in that it is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">to throw </span>from an area enclosed by such a partition into the public domain and vice versa; <span class="gemarra-regular">but to carry </span>within it as a full-fledged private domain <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited. </span>This implies that these are not proper partitions.
The Gemara refutes this objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>that statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman was stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it was stated </span>with regard to a case where one erected the partition <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally. </span>Since one intentionally violated Shabbat when he erected the partition, the Sages imposed a penalty that he is prohibited to carry within the enclosed area. But if the partition was made unwittingly or came about by itself, no such penalty was imposed, and one is permitted to carry.
The Gemara cites a related incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">A certain woman erected a partition on top of </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">partition in the property of a </span>deceased <span class="gemarra-regular">convert. A certain</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> man </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">plowed </span>the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">a little. </span>The man <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Naḥman, who established the </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his possession. </span>The woman then <span class="gemarra-regular">came and cried out before</span> Rav Naḥman. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to her: What can I do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for you, as </span>you <span class="gemarra-regular">did not take possession </span>of the property <span class="gemarra-regular">in the manner that people take possession. </span>
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span> the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span><span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one roofed </span>one <span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disputed whether or not the area of <span class="it-text">karpef</span> is two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, in which case it is permitted to carry there, or three <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, in which case it would be prohibited. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Its roofed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> space renders it in exces</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’</span><span class="it-text">a</span>, meaning that the roofed area is not considered separate from the rest, and so it is prohibited to carry in the <span class="it-text">karpef</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Zeira said: Its roofed space </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not render it in excess </span>of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’</span><span class="it-text">a</span>, and it is permitted to carry there. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava and Rabbi Zeira dispute the </span>same point that was the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute between Rav and Shmuel. </span>These <span class="it-text">amora’</span><span class="it-text">im</span> disagreed about the following, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was stated: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an enclosed veranda [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">akhsadra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is a roofed structure without walls or with incomplete walls, <span class="gemarra-regular">in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that has the status of a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: One is permitted to carry in the entire </span>enclosed veranda, as it is considered a private domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: One may carry only </span>a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits.</span> 
The Gemara explains the two opinions: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: One is permitted to carry in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>enclosed veranda, since <span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the edge of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the roof descends </span>to the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">and closes up </span>the enclosed veranda on all sides; consequently, it is considered a separate private domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: One may carry only </span>a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the edge of the roof descends and closes up</span> the enclosed veranda. 

Daf 25b

The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the roof in the covered section of the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">were made like an enclosed veranda </span>whose roof is level, <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed, </span>both Rava and Rabbi Zeira would agree that the edge of the roof descends to the ground and closes up the area. <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case where the roof <span class="gemarra-regular">is made</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like a hammock, </span>i.e., slanted, and therefore one cannot say that the edge of the roof descends to the ground and encloses the area.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: I agree </span>with Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is fully breached into a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning the entire wall between them is breached, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry in it. <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">space of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the courtyard </span>joins to the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">renders it in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> excess </span>of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>. Consequently, it is prohibited to carry in it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef strongly objects to this </span>explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">space </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">which it is permitted to </span>carry, the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">render </span>the <span class="it-text">karpef</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited? </span>Given that it had been permitted beforehand to carry from the courtyard to the <span class="it-text">karpef</span>, why say that now that the partition between them is breached, the additional space, which was itself permitted, should render it prohibited to carry in the <span class="it-text">karpef</span>?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: In</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with whose </span>opinion do you say this? Apparently, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>who holds that one is permitted to carry from a courtyard to a <span class="it-text">karpef</span>. But <span class="gemarra-regular">even according to Rabbi Shimon, there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the space where the walls </span>that are now breached had once stood. This space had not been fit for carrying from the outset, even according to Rabbi Shimon; therefore, if the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> had been at first exactly the area of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, it would be prohibited to carry in the entire <span class="it-text">karpef</span> due to the additional space of the fallen walls. 
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ḥisda said </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fully breached into a courtyard: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">the courtyard </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry. 
The Gemara asks: As for the <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the reason </span>that this is permitted? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it has the remnants </span>of the original walls on either side of the breach, which allow the breach to be treated like an entrance? <span class="gemarra-regular">But at times you find </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">the opposite; </span>if the courtyard was narrower than the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> and the partition between them was fully breached, it is the <span class="it-text">karpef</span> that retains the remnants of the original walls on either side of the breach, while the courtyard is breached in its entirety.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because we say </span>that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one, the <span class="it-text">karpef</span>, which was not enclosed for the purpose of residence and where one is permitted to carry only if it is no more than two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’</span><span class="it-text">a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">the space of the </span>fallen <span class="gemarra-regular">walls renders it in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">excess </span>of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>. However, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one, the courtyard, which was enclosed for the purpose of residence and where there is no size limit above which it is prohibited to carry, <span class="gemarra-regular">the space of the </span>fallen <span class="gemarra-regular">walls does not render it in excess of </span>any limit. 
The Gemara cites a related incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">A certain orchard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bustana</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was adjacent to the wall of a mansion</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">apadna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The orchard was larger than two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se</span><span class="it-text">’a</span> and was enclosed for the purpose of residence by a wall, part of which was the wall of the mansion. One day <span class="gemarra-regular">the outer wall of the mansion, </span>which also served as a wall for the orchard, <span class="gemarra-regular">collapsed. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai thought to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we can rely upon </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>mansion’s <span class="gemarra-regular">inner walls </span>to serve as a partition for the orchard and thereby permit one to carry there in the future as well. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Pappi said to him: Because you come from truncated [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mula</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’ei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] people</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as Rav Beivai’s family traced their lineage to the house of Eli, all of whose descendants were destined to be short-lived (see i Samuel 2:31), <span class="gemarra-regular">you speak truncated [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mulayata</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] matters, </span>as the inner wall cannot be relied upon at all. That is because <span class="gemarra-regular">these walls</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were made for the inside </span>of the mansion, and <span class="gemarra-regular">they were not made for the outside; </span>that is, they were not designed from the outset to serve as partitions for the orchard.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Exilarch</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had a </span>banqueting <span class="gemarra-regular">pavilion [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">abvarneka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in his orchard </span>that was larger than two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> and that had not been enclosed from the outset for the purpose of residence. The Exilarch <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana: Let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Master make </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">arrangement so that tomorrow, </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">we may eat bread there, </span>i.e., so that we may be permitted to carry food and utensils from the house to the pavilion via the orchard. 
Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana <span class="gemarra-regular">went and erected</span> a fence of <span class="gemarra-regular">reeds, </span>each reed separated from the next by <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>handbreadths. That is to say, he erected two such partitions between the house and the pavilion with a passageway between them, through which the Exilarch and his men could carry whatever they needed, as the partitions were constructed in the proper manner for the purpose of residence. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">went</span>

Daf 26a

and <span class="gemarra-regular">removed </span>the reeds, as he maintained that they were unnecessary; he regarded the entire orchard as having been enclosed for the purpose of residence, owing to the banqueting pavilion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav Yehoshua, went after him and collected </span>the reeds, so as to prevent Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana from restoring the partitions, as they were Rava’s students and wanted to enforce his ruling.
<span class="gemarra-regular">On the following</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day, </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina raised an objectio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Rava’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s </span>opinion from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> which states: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a new town, we measure </span>the Shabbat limit <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its settled </span>area, from where it is actually inhabited; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an old </span>town, we measure the Shabbat limit <span class="gemarra-regular">from its wall, </span>even if it is not inhabited up to its wall. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is a new </span>town, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is an old </span>town? <span class="gemarra-regular">A new </span>town is one <span class="gemarra-regular">that was </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">surrounded </span>by a wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward settled, </span>meaning that the town’s residents arrived after the wall had already been erected; <span class="gemarra-regular">an old </span>town is one <span class="gemarra-regular">that was </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">settled, and </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward surrounded</span> by a wall. Ravina raised his objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>orchard <span class="gemarra-regular">should also be considered like </span>a town <span class="gemarra-regular">that was </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">surrounded </span>by a wall <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward settled, </span>as it had not been enclosed from the outset for the purpose of residence. Even if a dwelling was later erected there, this should not turn it into a place that had been enclosed for the purpose of residence. 
Seeing that an additional objection could be raised against his teacher’s position, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rava: Didn’t Rav Asi say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>temporary <span class="gemarra-regular">screens </span>erected by <span class="gemarra-regular">architect</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to serve as protection against the sun and the like <span class="gemarra-regular">are not deemed </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions? Apparently</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, since it was erected </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">for privacy, </span>and not for the purpose of permanent dwelling, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not considered a</span> valid <span class="gemarra-regular">partition. Here too, </span>then, with regard to the fence around the orchard, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it was erected </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">for privacy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it should not be considered a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">partition.</span>
And <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehoshua, said to Rava: Didn’t Rav Huna say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a partition made for resting </span>objects alongside it and thereby providing them with protection <span class="gemarra-regular">is not considered a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">partition?</span>
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabba bar Avuh</span> did, when he <span class="gemarra-regular">constructed an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> separately for each <span class="gemarra-regular">row</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of houses in the whole </span>town <span class="gemarra-regular">of Meḥoza, due to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the ditches </span>from which <span class="gemarra-regular">the cattle </span>would feed that separated the rows of houses from one another. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shouldn’t</span> such <span class="gemarra-regular">cattle ditche</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be considered like a partition made </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for resting </span>objects alongside it? Such a partition is invalid. All these proofs indicate that Rava was wrong to remove the reed fences erected by Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana, for those fences were indeed necessary. 
With regard to the resolution of this incident, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Exilarch recited </span>the following <span class="gemarra-regular">verse about </span>these Rabbis: <span class="gemarra-regular">“They are wise to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Jeremiah 4:22), as on Friday they ruined the arrangement that Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana had made to permit carrying from the house to the pavilion, and the next day all they could do was prove that they had acted improperly the day before and that it was prohibited to carry in the orchard. 
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elai </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: I heard from Rabbi Eliezer </span>that one is permitted to carry in a garden or <span class="it-text">karpef</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the garden <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>thirty times larger than a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>. The Gemara notes that all agree that what the mishna taught was <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya, as it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya says: </span>One is permitted to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">even if it </span>is the size of of <span class="gemarra-regular">forty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, like the court of a king</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan said: Both </span>Rabbi Elai and Ḥananya <span class="gemarra-regular">derived </span>their opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">from the same verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: “And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it came to pass, before Isaiah was gone out into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the middle courtyard, </span>that the word of the Lord came to him, saying” (ii Kings 20:4). In the biblical text, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “The city [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ha’ir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” and we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> read </span>it as: “The middle <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥatzer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> as there is a difference in this verse between the written word and how it is spoken. <span class="gemarra-regular">From here </span>it is derived that <span class="gemarra-regular">royal courts were </span>as large <span class="gemarra-regular">as intermediate-</span>sized <span class="gemarra-regular">cities. </span>Consequently, there is no contradiction, as the central courtyard of the royal palace was itself like a small town. 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>Rabbi Elai and Ḥananya <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Elai, <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains: Intermediate-</span>sized <span class="gemarra-regular">towns are </span>the size of a field that had an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>Ḥananya, <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains: They are </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">forty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
The Gemara asks about the Biblical narrative cited above: <span class="gemarra-regular">What did Isaiah need </span>to do <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>in the middle court, i.e., why was he there? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: This teaches that Hezekiah took ill, and Isaiah went </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and established a </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">academy at his door, </span>so that Torah scholars would sit and occupy themselves with Torah outside his room, the merit of which would help Hezekiah survive. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Based on this, </span>it is derived, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a Torah scholar who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">took ill, that one establishes an academy at </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">entrance </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>home. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">This, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not a </span>proper <span class="gemarra-regular">course </span>of action, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps they will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">come to provoke Satan against him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Challenging Satan might worsen the health of a sick person rather than improve it. 
The mishna cites another statement made by Rabbi Elai in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: <span class="gemarra-regular">And I also heard from him </span>another <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one of the residents of a courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forgot and did not join in an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> with the other residents, and on Shabbat he ceded ownership of his share in the courtyard to the other residents, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited </span>for him, the one who forgot to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, to bring in objects or take them out from <span class="gemarra-regular">his house </span>to the courtyard; but it is permitted to the other residents to bring objects from their houses to that other person’s house via the courtyard, and vice versa.
The Gemara raises an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>for the one who forgot to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> to bring in objects or take them out from <span class="gemarra-regular">his house </span>to the courtyard,  <span class="gemarra-regular">and for </span>the other residents who did make an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">to take out </span>objects from the house to the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">or to bring </span>them into the house from the courtyard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav Yehoshua, said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. </span>

Daf 26b

<span class="gemarra-regular">This, </span>the mishna here, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, while that, </span>the other mishna, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis.</span>
Rav Sheshet adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">When you examine </span>the matter closely, you will find that <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the statement of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eliezer, one who renounces </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">authority over his </span>share in the <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to the other residents of the courtyard also <span class="gemarra-regular">renounces </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">authority over his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">house. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, one who renounces </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">authority over his </span>share in the <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard </span>to the other residents <span class="gemarra-regular">does not renounce </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">authority over his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">house</span> to them.
The Gemara expresses surprise at this comment: But it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that this is the point over which the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> disagree. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Raḥava said: </span>Both <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I explained: </span>Rav Sheshet’s explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">was necessary only with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">who lived in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the same courtyard, one of whom forgot to join in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> with the others. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">According to the statement of Rabbi Eliezer, when he renounces</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his authority, he need not renounce it to each and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> every one </span>of the residents, as we already know that Rabbi Eliezer holds that one who renounces authority does so in a generous manner, renouncing authority not only of his share in the courtyard, but also of his own house. Consequently, if he is required to renounce authority to many people, we assume that he does so even if this is not explicitly stated.
In contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, when</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he renounces his authority, </span>it does not suffice that he renounces it in favor of one person; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must</span> explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce it to each and every one, </span>as we cannot presume that he renounces authority in a generous manner. 
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">In</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with which </span><span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">that was taught</span> in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? If <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">lived in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the same courtyard, and one of them forgot and did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not join in an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> with the other residents, <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he renounces his authority, he need not renounce his authority </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to each and every one </span>of the residents. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion is it? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with Rabbi Eliezer, </span>as explained above. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana taught </span>the passage <span class="gemarra-regular">this way, </span>as cited above, that it was Raḥava and Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana who applied Rav Sheshet’s explanation to the case of the five people living in the same courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Tavyomei, </span>on the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">as follows, </span>that it was Rav Sheshet himself who applied it to that case: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with which </span><span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">that was taught </span>in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? If <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">lived in the same courtyard, and one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of them forgot and did not join in an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> with the other residents, <span class="gemarra-regular">when he renounces his authority, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">need not renounce his authority to each and every one </span>of the residents. This statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with whose </span>opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: In accordance with whom? In accordance with Rabbi Eliezer.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, </span>which presumes that one renounces his authority over his house as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>who forgot to join in an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with the other residents of the courtyard explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">stated: I am not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> renouncing </span>authority of my house, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>likewise, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, if he </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">stated: I am</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> renouncing </span>authority of my house, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in such cases?
The Gemara clarifies: Is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s reason because he maintains </span>in general that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">renounces authority over his </span>share in a courtyard to the other residents presumably also <span class="gemarra-regular">renounces </span>to them <span class="gemarra-regular">authority over his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">house, but </span>that since <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>person explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">stated: I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">am not renouncing </span>authority of my house, he therefore maintains his authority?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s reason </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">because people do not </span>generally <span class="gemarra-regular">live </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a house without a courtyard, </span>and therefore anyone who renounces authority over his share in a courtyard automatically renounces authority over his own house regardless of what he says. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">when he says: I am not renouncing </span>authority over my house, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in his power </span>to do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">as even though he says: I </span>will continue <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">live </span>in and retain authority over my house, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said nothing.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the question likewise arises <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. If one</span> explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">stated: I am renouncing </span>authority of my house as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>for the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis because they maintain </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> renounces authority over his </span>share in a <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard </span>to the other residents presumably <span class="gemarra-regular">does not renounce authority over his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">house </span>to them, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>person explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">stated: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I am renouncing </span>authority over my house, the other residents should be permitted to carry?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps the </span>for the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">because one does not usually remove</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> himself entirely from a house and courtyard, making himself like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a guest among </span>his neighbors. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">when he states</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: I am renouncing </span>authority over my house, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in his power </span>to do so, and his statement is disregarded. 
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Pappa in answer to his question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Both </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to the Rabbis and according to Rabbi Eliezer, once </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one has revealed his wishes, he has revealed </span>them, and everything follows his express wishes. 
The mishna records yet another teaching handed down by Rabbi Elai: <span class="gemarra-regular">And I also heard from </span>Rabbi Eliezer another <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">that one may fulfill his obligation </span>to eat bitter herbs <span class="gemarra-regular">on Passover with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">arkablin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a certain bitter herb. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">arkablin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Reish Lakish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-italic">Atzvata</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaruziyata</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a type of fiber that wraps itself around a date palm. 

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">establish a joining </span>of houses in courtyards [<span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">ḥatzerot</span>] in order to permit carrying on Shabbat in a courtyard shared by two or more houses, and one may establish a joining of Shabbat borders [<span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">teḥumin</span>] in order to extend the distance one is permitted to walk on Shabbat; <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may merge </span>courtyards in order to permit carrying in an alleyway shared by two or more courtyards. This may be done <span class="gemarra-regular">with all </span>kinds of food <span class="gemarra-regular">except for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> water and salt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as they are not considered foods and therefore may not be used for these purposes. 
The mishna continues with two similar principles: <span class="gemarra-regular">All </span>types of food <span class="gemarra-regular">may be bought with </span>second-<span class="gemarra-regular">tithe </span><span class="gemarra-regular">money, </span>which must be taken to Jerusalem and used to purchase food (Deuteronomy 14:26), <span class="gemarra-regular">except for water and salt. </span>Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows that nourishment </span>is prohibited to him <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted </span>to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">water and salt, </span>as they are not considered sources of nourishment.
It was further stated with regard to the laws of joining courtyards that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">teḥumin</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a nazirite with wine, </span>even though he is prohibited to drink it, because it is permitted to others. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, one may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">teḥumin</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for an Israelite with</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>even though he may not eat it, because it is permitted to a priest. The food used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">teḥumin</span> must be fit for human consumption, but it is not essential that it be fit for the consumption of the one for whom it is being used. <span class="gemarra-regular">Summakhos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>One may only establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">teḥumin</span> for an Israelite <span class="gemarra-regular">with unconsecrated </span>food. 
It was additionally stated that one may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">teḥumin</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a priest in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">haperas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a field containing a grave that was plowed over.

Daf 27a

<span class="gemarra-regular">since he can interpose </span>between himself and the graves <span class="gemarra-regular">and go and eat </span>the food that comprises the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> without contracting ritual impurity. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: One may not learn from general statements</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., when a general statement is made in a mishna using the word all, it is not to be understood as an all-inclusive, general statement without exceptions. This is true <span class="gemarra-regular">even in a place where it says </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">except</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Even in that case, there may be other exceptions to the rule that are not listed. 
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact that Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in a place where it says except, </span>this proves <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inference that he was not relating to </span>the general statement made <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>in the mishna, which uses the word except. <span class="gemarra-regular">To which </span>mishna, then, <span class="gemarra-regular">was he relating </span>when he formulated his principle?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He was relating </span>to a mishna found <span class="gemarra-regular">there: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all time-bound, positive</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> commandments, </span>i.e., mitzvot that can only be performed at a certain time of the day, or during the day rather than at night, or on certain days of the year, <span class="gemarra-regular">men are obligated </span>to perform them <span class="gemarra-regular">and women are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exempt. </span>But positive commandments <span class="gemarra-regular">that are not time-bound, both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> women and men are obligated </span>to perform.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Is it </span>a general <span class="gemarra-regular">principle </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">women are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exempt from all time-bound, positive commandments </span>without exception? But <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>the commandment to eat <span class="gemarra-italic">matza</span> on Passover, the commandment of <span class="gemarra-regular">rejoicing </span>on a Festival, and the commandment of <span class="gemarra-regular">assembly </span>in the Temple courtyard once every seven years during the festival of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> following the Sabbatical Year, all of which <span class="gemarra-regular">are time-bound, positive commandments, and </span>nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">women </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are obligated </span>to perform them.
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">are women obligated in all positive commandments</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that are not time-bound? </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>the commandment of <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah study, </span>the commandment to <span class="gemarra-regular">be fruitful and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">multiply, </span>and the commandment of <span class="gemarra-regular">redemption of the firstborn, </span>all of which are <span class="gemarra-regular">positive commandments that are not time-bound, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">women are exempt </span>from them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: One may not learn from general statements, even in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a place where it says except, </span>because it is always possible that there other exceptions to the rule. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya</span> who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">We, too, have also learned </span>a proof for Rabbi Yoḥanan’s principle from a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">They stated </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>general <span class="gemarra-regular">principle: Anything </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">carried upon a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And anything on which a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is carried is </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">pure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">suitable for lying or sitting upon and a human being</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which become defiled if a <span class="it-text">zav</span> is borne on them. The following objection may be raised: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nothing else? But there is </span>an object upon which a person <span class="gemarra-regular">ride</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that becomes impure, as explained in the Torah itself. 
The Gemara first asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of an object upon which <span class="gemarra-regular">one rides? If he sat upon it, it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is a seat. </span>If not, how does it become defiled? What is there that is suitable for riding upon but does not fall into the category of something upon which one lies or sits? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">We say as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">follows: There is the upper part of a saddle, </span>which becomes ritually impure as a riding accessory and not as a regular seat. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A saddle </span>upon which a <span class="it-text">zav</span> sat <span class="gemarra-regular">is impur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> as <span class="gemarra-regular">a seat </span>of a <span class="it-text">zav</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the pommel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is attached to the front of the saddle and used by the rider to maintain his position or to assist in mounting, <span class="gemarra-regular">is impure </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">a riding </span>accessory. Therefore, we see that the general statement found in the mishna omits that which is suitable for riding upon. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, conclude</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not learn from general statements</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, even in a place where it says except.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span>who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">We, too, have also learned </span>a proof for Rabbi Yoḥanan’s principle from the mishna, which states: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may establish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and merge </span>alleyways <span class="gemarra-regular">with all </span>kinds of food, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for water and salt. And is there nothing else? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But there are truffles and mushrooms, </span>which also may not be used for an <span class="it-text">eiru</span><span class="it-text">v</span> because they are not regarded as food. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, conclude from this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learn from general statements, even in a place where it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says except.</span>
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">All </span>types of food <span class="gemarra-regular">may be bought with </span>second-<span class="gemarra-regular">tithe money, </span>except for water and salt. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina </span>both had the same tradition, but <span class="gemarra-regular">one teaches </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and one teaches </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the second <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe.</span>
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">One teaches </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the issue of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">They only taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not establish an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> with water or salt in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">water</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by itself or salt by itself. But </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and salt </span>together, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one teaches </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the issue of the second <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe: They only taught </span>that water or salt <span class="gemarra-regular">may not be bought </span>with second-tithe money in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">water by itself or salt by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">itself. But water and salt </span>mixed together <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bought with </span>second-<span class="gemarra-regular">tithe</span> money.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who teaches </span>this law <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the second <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe, all the more</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so </span>would he apply it <span class="gemarra-regular">to an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., he would certainly maintain that water and salt together are suitable to be used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. However, according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who teaches </span>this law <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it applies only to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">but with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to </span>the second tithe, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>it does not apply. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this distinction? For the second tithe, <span class="gemarra-regular">we require produce, </span>as stated in the Torah, and even when water and salt are mixed together they do not have the status of produce.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yitzḥak came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">he taught </span>this law <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the second <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe. </span>The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an objection </span>from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Gadish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> testified before Rabbi Eliezer: In Father’s house they would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> buy </span>fish <span class="gemarra-regular">brine with </span>second-<span class="gemarra-regular">tithe money. He said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: Perhaps you only heard </span>this in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the fish’s innards were mixed with </span>the brine. Since this mixture contains a small portion of the fish, the brine becomes significant enough to be purchased with second-tithe money. <span class="gemarra-regular">And even Rabbi Yehuda ben Gadish only said </span>his statement <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to brine, which is the fat of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> produce, </span>i.e., because a certain amount of fish fat, which itself may be purchased with second-tithe money, is mixed in with the brine; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>a mixture of <span class="gemarra-regular">water</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and salt </span>alone may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be bought with it.
In response to this difficulty, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said:</span>

Daf 27b

Rabbi Yitzḥak’s ruling that water and salt mixed together may be bought with second-tithe money <span class="gemarra-regular">was only</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> necessary </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one added oil to them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> But a mixture of water and salt alone may not be purchased with second-tithe money. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rav Yosef: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him derive </span>that the mixture may be bought with second-tithe money <span class="gemarra-regular">because of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">oil </span>alone. The Gemara refutes this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for a case in which <span class="gemarra-regular">one paid the value </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the water and salt by including </span>it in the payment for the oil. Although ostensibly the money that he paid was for the oil, he added to the price of the oil in order to include payment for the water and salt that were mixed with it. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if something may not be bought with second-tithe money, <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one permitted </span>to buy it <span class="gemarra-regular">by including </span>it in the payment for something which may be bought with second-tithe money? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, and so it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ben Bag Ba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says </span>in exposition of the verse: “And you shall bestow that money on all that your heart desires, on oxen, on sheep, on wine, on strong drink, on whatever your soul requests” (Deuteronomy 14:26): <span class="gemarra-regular">“On oxen” teaches that one may buy</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an ox </span>and include in its price payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hide</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Although the hide cannot be eaten, it may be bought together with the ox, and it does not acquire the sanctity of the second tithe. <span class="gemarra-regular">“On sheep”</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teaches that one may buy a sheep </span>and include in its price payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">its fleece, </span>which is used for purposes other than eating. <span class="gemarra-regular">“On wine” teaches that one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may buy wine </span>and include in its price payment for <span class="gemarra-regular">its jug. “On strong drink” teaches that </span>one is permitted to buy not only actual wine, but <span class="gemarra-regular">one may buy</span> even <span class="gemarra-regular">mead, </span>water in which grape seeds are soaked, <span class="gemarra-regular">once</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it has fermented </span>and acquired the flavor of wine. 
Having cited ben Bag Bag’s exposition of the verse, the Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan said: Whoever interprets </span>the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“on oxen” for me</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Bag Bag, I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will carry his clothes after hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into the bathhouse, </span>i.e., I will honor him to such an extent that I will be prepared to treat him as a servant treats his master.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for Rabbi Yoḥanan’s difficulty? <span class="gemarra-regular">All </span>parts of the verse cited above <span class="gemarra-regular">are necessary, except for </span>the expression <span class="gemarra-regular">“on oxen,” </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which is not necessary. </span>The Gemara clarifies: For <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>purpose are all the other words <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary? As, if the Torah </span><span class="gemarra-regular">had written </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">“on oxen,” I might have said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>only an <span class="gemarra-regular">ox that may be bought </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with its hide </span>with second-tithe money <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the hide <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>an inseparable part of <span class="gemarra-regular">its body, </span>and therefore it is not considered an independent entity from its flesh. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>as for buying a <span class="gemarra-regular">sheep </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with its fleece, which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>an inseparable part of <span class="gemarra-regular">its body </span>because the fleece can be removed from the sheep while it is alive, you might <span class="gemarra-regular">say no, </span>second-tithe money may not be spent in this manner. It was therefore necessary to state “on sheep.” 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if the Torah had </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">written</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “on sheep,” </span>teaching that one may buy even a sheep with second-tithe money together <span class="gemarra-regular">with its fleece, I might</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have said </span>that it is only a sheep that may be bought together with its fleece <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the fleece <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> attached to it, </span>and therefore it is considered part of the animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>as for buying <span class="gemarra-regular">wine </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> jug, </span>you might <span class="gemarra-regular">say no, </span>second-tithe money may not be spent this way. It was therefore necessary to state “on wine.” 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if the Torah had </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">written “on wine,” </span>indicating that one may even buy wine together with its jug with second-tithe money, <span class="gemarra-regular">I might </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">have said </span>that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the jug <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>needed for the wine’s <span class="gemarra-regular">preservation, </span>as there is no way to carry wine without some sort of container. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">mea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fermented</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which is mere acidity, </span>you might <span class="gemarra-regular">say no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it should not be included among the items that may be bought with second-tithe money. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah wrote</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>“On <span class="gemarra-regular">strong drink.”</span>
The necessity of each word much be proven in the opposite order as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if the Torah had </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">written “on strong drink,” I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">might have said: What is </span>meant by <span class="gemarra-regular">strong drink? Dried</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> figs from </span>the town of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ke’ila, which are </span>choice and juicy figs that can have an intoxicating effect. They are therefore considered <span class="gemarra-regular">produce </span>and not merely mead. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>as for buying <span class="gemarra-regular">wine </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with its jug, </span>you might <span class="gemarra-regular">say no, </span>this may not be done with second-tithe money, and therefore it was necessary to state “on wine.” 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if the Torah had </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">written</span> “on wine,” indicating that one may buy even <span class="gemarra-regular">wine </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with its jug </span>with second-tithe money, I might have said that this is because the jug <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>needed for the wine’s <span class="gemarra-regular">preservation. But </span>as for buying a <span class="gemarra-regular">sheep </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with its fleece, </span>you might <span class="gemarra-regular">say no, </span>this may not be done with second-tithe money. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah stated </span>“on <span class="gemarra-regular">sheep,” </span>to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a sheep may be bought with second-tithe money <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its fleece.</span>
If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“on oxen”? </span>If one may purchase a sheep together with its fleece with second-tithe money, it should certainly be permitted to buy an ox together with its hide. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if the Torah had </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not written “on oxen,” I might have said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sheep </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with its hide, yes, </span>it may be bought with second-tithe money, but together <span class="gemarra-regular">with its fleece, no, </span>it may not be bought; therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah wrote “on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">oxen,” to include its hide, </span>and so “on <span class="gemarra-regular">sheep” remains </span>available for interpretation <span class="gemarra-regular">to include its fleece, </span>i.e., that a sheep may be bought even together with its fleece. Therefore, the words “on oxen” are necessary, for without them I would have understood “on sheep” differently.
This argument can, however, be refuted: Even <span class="gemarra-regular">if the Torah had not written “on oxen,” I would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not have said </span>that a <span class="gemarra-regular">sheep </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with its hide</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, yes, </span>it may be bought with second-tithe money, but together <span class="gemarra-regular">with its fleece, no, </span>it may not. For <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it were <span class="gemarra-regular">so, the Torah should have written </span>“on <span class="gemarra-regular">oxen,” in which case </span>the words “on <span class="gemarra-regular">sheep” would remain</span> available for interpretation. “On sheep” can be explained in two ways, both in reference to its hide as well as in reference to its fleece. Had the Torah wanted to teach only that an animal may be bought together with its hide but not with its fleece, it would have written “on oxen” only, which would have left no room for error, as oxen do not have fleece.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And since the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Torah writes </span>“on <span class="gemarra-regular">sheep,” </span>teaching that a sheep may be bought with second-tithe money <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fleece, why do I need </span>the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“on oxen”? </span>These words are <span class="gemarra-regular">now </span>entirely superfluous. If a <span class="gemarra-regular">sheep may be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bought </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with its fleece, is it necessary </span>to state that an <span class="gemarra-regular">ox </span>may be bought together <span class="gemarra-regular">with its hide</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? This is what Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>meant when he <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Whoever</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> interprets </span>the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“on oxen” for me in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Bag Bag, I will carry </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his clothes after him into the bathhouse.</span>
The Gemara now returns to the tannaitic disagreement pertaining to buying fish brine with second-tithe money: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Gadish, and Rabbi Eliezer, and these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">im</span> whose views will be cited <span class="gemarra-regular">below, disagree? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Gadish and Rabbi Eliezer expound </span>the verse based on the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">amplifications and restrictions, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> expound </span>it based on the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">generalizations and details</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is a different approach to biblical exegesis. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Gadish and Rabbi Eliezer expound </span>the verse based on the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">amplifications and restrictions. </span>When the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall bestow the money on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all that your heart desires” </span>(Deuteronomy 14:26), <span class="gemarra-regular">it has amplified</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>When it then states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“On oxen, on sheep, on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wine, and on strong drink,” it has restricted </span>its discussion to certain specific items. When it concludes with the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“On whatever your soul requests,” it has </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">again amplified</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>According to this exegetical approach, we conclude that since <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> amplified and restricted and </span>once again <span class="gemarra-regular">amplified, it has amplified</span> the general category to include <span class="gemarra-regular">everything. What has it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">amplified </span>the category to include? <span class="gemarra-regular">It has amplified </span>the category to include <span class="gemarra-regular">everything. And what has it restricted </span>from inclusion in the category? Only one thing: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Eliezer, it restricted brine </span>from inclusion because brine is not at all similar to the items listed in the verse; <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Yehuda ben Gadish, it restricted water and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">salt. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And these </span>other <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">im</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> expound </span>the verse according to the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">generalizations </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and details, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall bestow the money on all that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your heart desires” </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, </span>as no particular type of food is specified. The phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“On cattle, on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sheep, on wine, and on strong drink” </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a detail, </span>as specific types of food are mentioned. When the verse concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">“On whatever your soul requests,” it has generalized again</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as no specific type of food is mentioned. Since the verse is formulated as <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, and a detail, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and a generalization, you may deduce </span>that the verse is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>to items <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to the detail. Just as </span>the items mentioned in <span class="gemarra-regular">the detail </span>are clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">defined as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the produce of produce, </span>i.e., not only the produce itself but also things that come from it, such as the calf that comes from a cow or grapes from a seed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they are also things <span class="gemarra-regular">grown from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ground, </span>as all of these items grow from the ground or receive their main sustenance from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>it includes <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>things that are <span class="gemarra-regular">the produce of produce and are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">grown from the ground.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was taught in the other </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>the items mentioned in <span class="gemarra-regular">the detail </span>are clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">defined as the offspring</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the offspring of the earth, </span>i.e., things that come from items that came from the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>it includes <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>things that are <span class="gemarra-regular">the offspring of the offspring</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the earth.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>these two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: There is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">fish. According to the one who said </span>that we apply the law to that which is <span class="gemarra-regular">the produce of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> produce and grown from the ground, fish are </span>regarded as having <span class="gemarra-regular">grown from the ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> However, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one who said </span>we apply it to that which is <span class="gemarra-regular">the offspring of the offspring of the earth, fish were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> created from water. </span>Therefore, they are not of the offspring of the earth, and consequently they are not included among the items that may be purchased with second-tithe money. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">fish are </span>regarded as having been <span class="gemarra-regular">grown from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the ground? Didn’t Abaye say the following?</span>

Daf 28a

If <span class="gemarra-regular">one ate a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">putita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a certain water insect, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is given four </span>sets of <span class="gemarra-regular">lashes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as he has transgressed four separate negative Torah commandments, two that relate to creeping animals in general and two that relate to water insects in particular.If he ate <span class="gemarra-regular">an ant, he is given five </span>sets of <span class="gemarra-regular">lashes </span>for violating the two general prohibitions and another three negative commandments stated with regard to insects that creep upon the earth. If he ate <span class="gemarra-regular">a hornet, he is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> given six </span>sets of <span class="gemarra-regular">lashes, </span>for in addition to the prohibitions applying to an ant, he has transgressed a prohibition stated with regard to flying insects. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is</span> correct that something that lives in water is considered as growing from the ground, one who eats <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">putita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also be given lashes for </span>violating the following prohibition: “And <span class="gemarra-regular">every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth </span>is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 11:41). Rather, fish must certainly not be considered as growing from the ground, and therefore this explanation is to be rejected.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Ravina said: There is</span> a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">fowl. According to the one who said </span>that one may use second-tithe money only to purchase food which is <span class="gemarra-regular">the produce of produce and grown from the ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these </span>fowl <span class="gemarra-regular">are also </span>regarded as having <span class="gemarra-regular">grown from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the ground. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one who said </span>that we apply it to that which is <span class="gemarra-regular">the offspring of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the offspring of the earth, these fowl were created from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and not from the ground, and consequently they are not included among the items that may be bought with second-tithe money. 
These two distinct opinions are both based upon the exegetical principle of a generalization and a detail. The Gemara now asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the reason of the one who includes fowl, and what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the reason of the one who excludes fowl?</span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who includes fowl holds </span>that when there is a generalization, a detail, and another generalization, <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter generalization</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is primary. </span>Therefore, the rule is similar to that governing <span class="gemarra-regular">a detail </span>followed by <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization, </span>which maintains that <span class="gemarra-regular">the generalization is considered an addition to the detail, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">items are included. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first generalization is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">effective in excluding anything that is not similar to </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in two respects, </span>as it is nonetheless a case of a generalization, a detail, and a generalization. Therefore, he excludes anything that does not grow from the ground and is not the produce of produce.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">excludes fowl holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first generalization is primary. </span>Therefore, a generalization, detail, and generalization is similar to a single <span class="gemarra-regular">generalization </span>that is followed by <span class="gemarra-regular">a detail, </span>with regard to which we maintain that <span class="gemarra-regular">the generalization only includes that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which is </span>spelled out <span class="gemarra-regular">in the detail. </span>Therefore, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>items mentioned in the verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>one may purchase them with second-tithe money. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">something </span><span class="gemarra-regular">else, no, </span>one may not. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter generalization is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> effective to include anything that is similar to it in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> three respects, </span>namely, it is the produce of produce, grows from the ground, and is offspring of the offspring of the earth, to the exclusion of fowl.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the name of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, </span>who said <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav: One may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> with cheap and unimportant produce such as <span class="gemarra-regular">cress, purslane</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and sweet clover</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with green grai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or with unripe dates</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But may one establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sweet clover? Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">sweet clover </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">those who have many children</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may eat </span>it, but <span class="gemarra-regular">those without children may not eat</span> it, as it is harmful to one’s reproductive capacity; <span class="gemarra-regular">and if it was hardened into seed, </span>i.e., if it became very hard and already fit to be planted, <span class="gemarra-regular">even those who have many children may not eat </span>it? Therefore, we see that it is prohibited to eat sweet clover. How can it possibly be used to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Interpret</span> Rav’s statement as referring to sweet clover <span class="gemarra-regular">that was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">hardened into seed, and </span>its use for establishing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is limited to <span class="gemarra-regular">those who have many children</span> and are therefore permitted to eat it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, </span>you can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">actually, </span>sweet clover is fit for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> even <span class="gemarra-regular">for those without children because it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fit </span>to be eaten by <span class="gemarra-regular">those who have many children</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The food used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> must be edible, but it does not need to be edible for the particular person using it as his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn</span> in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nazirite with wine, and for an Israelite with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Apparently</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>these items may be used as an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even though</span> they <span class="gemarra-regular">are not fit for this </span>person, because they are <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for that </span>other person. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, even though </span>the sweet clover <span class="gemarra-regular">is not fit for this </span>person, it may be used because <span class="gemarra-regular">it is fit for that </span>other person. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wish, </span>you can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav said </span>that sweet clover may be used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, he was referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Median clover, </span>which is of superior quality and is not harmful.
The Gemara considers the continuation of Rav’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>may one <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with green grain? Didn’t Rav Yehuda say that Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">dodder and green grain, one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with them; and </span>when eating <span class="gemarra-regular">them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one recites the blessing: Who creates the fruit of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ground?</span>
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>first statement, according to which green grain may not be used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, was made <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav came to Babylonia. That </span>second statement was made <span class="gemarra-regular">after Rav came to Babylonia </span>and saw that people there ate green grain, at which point he ruled that it is fit to be used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is Babylonia the majority of the world</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Laws are established according to the custom prevalent in most of the world. <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">beans, barley</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and fenugree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that</span> one <span class="gemarra-regular">planted </span>in order to use <span class="gemarra-regular">as an herb, </span>e.g., as animal fodder, <span class="gemarra-regular">his opinion is rendered irrelevant by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the opinions of all other people? </span>Since most people do not act this way, we do not consider this particular person’s intention to be significant. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, one is obligated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to tithe their seeds, and their herbs are exempt. </span>When one harvests these plants in their green state, before their seeds have matured, they are regarded as not having fully ripened. However, in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">cress and arugula</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which are commonly eaten both in their green state and as seeds, if <span class="gemarra-regular">one planted them </span>in order to use them <span class="gemarra-regular">as herbs, they are tithed </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">as herbs and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as seeds; </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">one planted them for </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds, they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are tithed as seeds and as herbs, </span>no matter how they are eaten. In any case, the first part of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that the law is determined in accordance with the common custom of most of the world and not with the practice in one particular place.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav said </span>that green grain may be used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>,

Daf 28b

he was referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">garden variety, </span>which is commonly eaten. 
Having mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">arugul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seeds, </span>the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">For</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what are they suitable? </span>Generally, only the plant’s leaves are eaten. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The earlier </span>generations, <span class="gemarra-regular">who had</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no pepper, would crush </span>these seeds <span class="gemarra-regular">and dip </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">roasted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> meat in them. </span>Therefore, arugula seeds are also eaten, even though this is not their typical use.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rabbi Zeira was exhausted from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his studies, he would go and sit at the entrance</span> to the academy <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yehuda bar Ami, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: When the Sages go in and out, I shall stand</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> up before them and receive reward for </span>honoring <span class="gemarra-regular">them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is a mitzva to honor Torah scholars. Too tired to engage in actual Torah study, he sought a way to rest while fulfilling a different mitzva at the same time.
Once, a young <span class="gemarra-regular">school child</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was leaving </span>the study hall. Rabbi Zeira <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: What did your teacher teach you </span>today? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: </span>The proper blessing for <span class="gemarra-regular">dodde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> is: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">creates the fruit of the ground; </span>the proper blessing for <span class="gemarra-regular">green grai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> is: <span class="gemarra-regular">By Whose word all things came to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be. </span>Rabbi Zeira <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: On the contrary, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> opposite is </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">reasonable, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>the green grain, <span class="gemarra-regular">derives nourishment from the ground, whereas that, </span>the dodder, <span class="gemarra-regular">derives </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nourishment from the air, </span>and it is fitting to recite a blessing over each item in accordance with its source of nourishment. 
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>young <span class="gemarra-regular">school child. What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">This, </span>the dodder, is <span class="gemarra-regular">fully ripened produce, and that, </span>green grain, is <span class="gemarra-regular">not fully ripened produce. </span>If produce is not fully ripened one can only recite the blessing: By Whose word all things came to be. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that which you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: This, </span>the green grain, <span class="gemarra-regular">derives nourishment from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ground, whereas that, </span>the dodder, <span class="gemarra-regular">derives nourishment from the air, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this is not so. Dodder also derives nourishment from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ground, for we see that when the </span>prickly <span class="gemarra-regular">shrub is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cut off, the dodder </span>attached to it <span class="gemarra-regular">dies. </span>This shows that dodder also derives its nourishment from the ground, albeit indirectly.
The Gemara now considers the next part of Rav’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is it correct that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with unripe dates</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Wasn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Heart of palm</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the soft, edible inner core of a palm tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be bought with </span>second-<span class="gemarra-regular">tithe money</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but it does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not contract the </span>ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity of foods</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is not actually a food, but rather a part of the tree itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">And unripe dates may be bought with </span>second-<span class="gemarra-regular">tithe money, and </span>they even <span class="gemarra-regular">contract the </span>ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of foods</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says </span>this somewhat differently: <span class="gemarra-regular">Heart of palm is like a tree in all its </span>legal <span class="gemarra-regular">aspects, except that it may be bought with </span>second-<span class="gemarra-regular">tithe money, </span>as it is edible. <span class="gemarra-regular">And unripe dates are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">like fruit in all regards, </span>as they are actual fruit, <span class="gemarra-regular">except </span>with respect to one characteristic, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">that they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are exempt from tithe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> because they are not yet fully ripened. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">fruit </span>of palms that <span class="gemarra-regular">never </span>fully <span class="gemarra-regular">ripen</span>. They are therefore regarded as full-fledged fruit even in their unripe state. Rav, however, was referring to the fruit of palms, which eventually ripen. Their unripe state is merely a transitional stage in their development.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, would Rabbi Yehuda say with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are exempt from tithes? Wasn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unripe figs of </span>the place called <span class="gemarra-regular">Beityon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were only mentioned</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to tithes, </span>as it was stated: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the unripe figs of Beityoni, and the unripe</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dates of </span>the place called <span class="gemarra-regular">Tuvina, one is obligated to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tithe them </span>even though they never ripen, since they are considered full-fledged fruit in all respects?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>say as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is not referring to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fruit </span>of palms that <span class="gemarra-regular">never </span>fully <span class="gemarra-regular">ripen, </span>but rather to the fruit of palms that eventually ripen. However, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">pertaining to the </span>ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity of foods</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is different, </span>and an item’s status as a food with regard to the impurity of foods cannot be brought as proof of its status as a food with regard to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Yoḥanan said </span>elsewhere: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they are fit to be sweetened through </span>cooking with <span class="gemarra-regular">fire, </span>they are regarded as food for the purpose of tithes; <span class="gemarra-regular">here too, </span>we can say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since they are fit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to be sweetened through </span>cooking with <span class="gemarra-regular">fire, </span>unripe dates are fit to contract the impurity of foods. However, with regard to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, we require food that is ready for consumption, and something that can be prepared to become food is not sufficient. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where was </span>this comment of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>originally <span class="gemarra-regular">stated? </span>The Gemara answers: It was stated <span class="gemarra-regular">on this </span>ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">which was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: One is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">bitter almonds </span>while they are still <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>and green, as they are fit to be eaten while still undeveloped. When they are <span class="gemarra-regular">large, </span>however, one is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from tithing them, as they are no longer edible. One is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated to </span>tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">sweet, large</span> almonds, whereas one is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>tithing <span class="gemarra-regular">small ones, </span>as they have not yet fully ripened. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, son of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yosei, said in the name of his father: </span>One is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>tithing <span class="gemarra-regular">both this and that, </span>large and small bitter almonds. <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>that he said in the name of his father: One is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated to</span> tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">both this and that. Rabbi Ila said: Rabbi Ḥanina</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ruled in Tzippori in accordance with the one who said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>One is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt from </span>tithing <span class="gemarra-regular">both this and that</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the view of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who said </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated to</span> tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">both this and that, for what are </span>large, bitter almonds <span class="gemarra-regular">suitable? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Since </span>these almonds <span class="gemarra-regular">are fit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to be sweetened </span>and made edible <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>cooking with <span class="gemarra-regular">fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>they are regarded as food for the purpose of tithes.
The Gemara further examines the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited earlier. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda says: Heart of palm is like a tree in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all its </span>legal <span class="gemarra-regular">aspects, except that it may be bought</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>second-<span class="gemarra-regular">tithe money. </span>The Gemara asks: Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>identical to that of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: There is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">one boiled or fried </span>the heart of palm. According to Rabbi Yehuda, it does not contract the ritual impurity of foods even if it was boiled or fried, whereas the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> holds that in that case it does contract impurity.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava strongly objects to this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Is there </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who said </span>that even if <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> boiled or fried it, </span>it does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>contract the ritual impurity of foods? <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The hide and the placenta </span>of an animal, which people do not typically eat, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not contract the </span>ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity of foods; </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">a hide that one boile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> until it became edible <span class="gemarra-regular">and a placenta that one intended </span>to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">do contract the impurity of foods? </span>This indicates that even something not originally fit to be eaten contracts the impurity of foods once it has been boiled or fried, and the same should apply to heart of palm according to all opinions.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: There is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the blessing </span>that must be recited prior to eating, <span class="gemarra-regular">for it was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed about the blessing recited over heart of palm: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>the appropriate blessing is: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">creates the fruit of the ground. And Shmuel said </span>the appropriate blessing is: <span class="gemarra-regular">By Whose word all things came to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be. </span>
The Gemara explains the two opinions: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>the appropriate blessing is: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who creates the fruit of the ground, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> food. </span>Since heart of palm is edible it is called a fruit, and we recite a blessing over it in the manner of all fruits. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said </span>the appropriate blessing is: <span class="gemarra-regular">By Whose word all things came to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be. Since it will eventually harden </span>and become like an inedible tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not recite over it the blessing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Who creates the fruit of the ground, </span>as it will eventually lose the status of a fruit. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said to Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shinnana</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your opinion is reasonable, as a radish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will eventually harden, and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">we recite over it the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">blessing: Who creates the fruit of the ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">But it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not so, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">people plant radish with the intention </span>of eating it while it is <span class="gemarra-regular">soft; but people do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not plant palm trees with the intention </span>of eating <span class="gemarra-regular">heart </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of palm. </span>Therefore, heart of palm is not considered the fruit of the palm, but rather food extracted from it, over which only the following blessing should be recited: By Whose word all things came to be. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even though Shmuel praised Rav Yehuda, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel.</span>
The Gemara now examines <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter itself</span> cited in the previous discussion in the name of Rav. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said that Rav said </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">dodder</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and green grain: One may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>when eating <span class="gemarra-regular">them one recites the blessing: Who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">creates the fruit of the ground. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span><span class="gemarra-regular">much dodder </span>must be used to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Yeḥiel said </span>with regard to a similar issue: <span class="gemarra-regular">A handful. Here, too, </span>the measure is <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handful. </span>
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">how much green grain</span> is needed to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Toviya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Yitzḥak said that Rav said: A full farmers’ </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bundle.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥilkiya bar Toviya said: One may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with glasswort</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara expresses astonishment: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does it enter your mind </span>that one may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with glasswort? </span>People do not eat glasswort. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>one may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with the herb from </span>whose ashes <span class="gemarra-regular">glasswort </span>is prepared, as it is fit for human consumption before it is burnt. <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span>of it is needed to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yeḥiel said: A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">handful.</span>
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">went out to </span>visit certain <span class="gemarra-regular">villages, </span>and the villagers <span class="gemarra-regular">asked him: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to establishing an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with moist beans? He did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>an answer for them. <span class="gemarra-regular">When he came to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">study hall, they said to him: This is what Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yannai said: One may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with moist beans</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And how much </span>is needed for that purpose? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yeḥiel said: A handful.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: One may </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with raw beets</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? Didn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t Rav Ḥisda say: Raw beet kills a healthy person</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which indicates that beets are unhealthy and should therefore be unfit for establishing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? 

Daf 29a

The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a beet <span class="gemarra-regular">that was </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">partially cooked</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is dangerous.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna said: One may not establish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with raw beets</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Raw beet kills a healthy person. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Don’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t we see </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">eating it and they do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">die? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a beet <span class="gemarra-regular">that was </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">partially cooked, </span>which is dangerous.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cooked dish of beets is beneficial for the heart, good </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for the eyes, and all the more so </span>beneficial <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the intestines. Abaye said: That is </span>specifically when the dish <span class="gemarra-regular">sits on the stove and makes a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tukh</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tukh</span> sound, i.e., it is cooked thoroughly enough to produce a boiling sound.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>when he was in an especially good mood: <span class="gemarra-regular">Behold, I am like </span>the intellectually sharp <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Azzai, </span>who would regularly expound <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">markets of Tiberias. </span>I, too, am ready to answer any question posed to me. <span class="gemarra-regular">One of the Sages said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rava: How many apples </span>are needed to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Does one establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">apples</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> 
The other Sage responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permissible to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with them? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t we learn </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">All foods combine to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disqualify the bod</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> of a priest who eats <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a half-loaf </span>of ritually impure food, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>to complete the measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">food </span>required for <span class="gemarra-regular">two meals for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>to complete the measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg-bulk </span>required for a food to be able <span class="gemarra-regular">to contract the </span>ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity of foods</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> An apple is a kind of food, so it should be included in the items that may be used to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the refutation? If you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it was taught </span>using the term <span class="gemarra-regular">all foods, and these </span>apples <span class="gemarra-regular">are fit for eating, </span>how can an objection be raised from such a general term? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">say: One may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learn from general statements </span>using the word all, <span class="gemarra-regular">even in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a place where it says except, </span>since no rule exhausts all cases?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it taught: And</span> all foods combine to complete the measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">food </span>required for <span class="gemarra-regular">two meals for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>to complete the measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg-bulk to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contract the </span>ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity of foods; and these </span>apples <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">also susceptible to the </span>ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity of foods. </span>Therefore, there is clear proof that the mishna is referring to apples as well.
Having established that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may be established with apples, the Gemara returns to the question raised above: <span class="gemarra-regular">How many </span>apples are needed to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>The minimum measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">apples </span>that must be used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>When distributing poor man’s tithe, one must give each individual poor person at least <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ukla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> an eighth of a <span class="it-text">log</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">of spices, a liter of vegetables</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, ten nuts, five peaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two pomegranates, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">one citron</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as these are worthy amounts for distribution. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Gursak </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Darei said in the name of Rav Menashya bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sheguvlei, </span>who said <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rav: And similarly, </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Now, it can be asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">These </span>apples <span class="gemarra-regular">should also be like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> peaches, </span>as they are similar in size, and it should be enough to use five apples for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
The Gemara answers that there is a distinction between them: <span class="gemarra-regular">These </span>peaches <span class="gemarra-regular">are important</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and therefore five of them are a significant amount, <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these </span>apples <span class="gemarra-regular">are not important, </span>and therefore one must use the larger measure of a <span class="it-text">kav</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: May</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his Master, </span>God, <span class="gemarra-regular">forgiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Menashya bar Sheguvlei, </span>for he erred and caused others to err. <span class="gemarra-regular">I stated before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>a ruling in the name of Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mishna, and he stated it concerning the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which led to the error. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not give a pauper </span>receiving poor man’s tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">at the threshing floor less than half a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of wheat or </span>less than <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of barley</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Meir says: </span>He must be given at least <span class="gemarra-regular">half</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of barley. </span>Similarly, he must be given no less than <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a half of spelt, a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of dried figs, or a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">maneh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of pressed figs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rabbi Akiva says: </span>Not a <span class="it-text">maneh</span>, but <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>a <span class="it-text">maneh</span>. He must be given at least <span class="gemarra-regular">half a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of wine. Rabbi Akiva says: </span>Half that amount, <span class="gemarra-regular">a quarter </span><span class="it-text">log</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, he must be given <span class="gemarra-regular">a quarter </span><span class="it-text">log</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of oil. Rabbi Akiva says: </span>Half that amount, <span class="gemarra-regular">an eighth </span>of a <span class="it-text">log</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all other fruit, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Shaul said: </span>He must be given <span class="gemarra-regular">enough to sell </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them and buy food </span>that suffices <span class="gemarra-regular">for two meals with </span>the proceeds of <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>sale. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to this mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: And similarly, </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara poses a question with regard to Rav Yosef’s harsh reaction to Rav Menashya bar Sheguvlei’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the strength of this over that? </span>The mishna and <span class="it-text">baraita</span> seem to share the same content, so why should Rav’s ruling be more applicable to one than the other? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">spices was </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">taught in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and spices are not fit for eating </span>on their own but only when added as a flavoring to other foods, and therefore Rav could not have been referring to the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> when he said that the same law applies to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">wasn’t </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat and barley taught here </span>in the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">are not </span>immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for eating </span>until they are processed further. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is because it was taught </span>in the mishna that one must give <span class="gemarra-regular">half a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of wine. And Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: One may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with two-quarters </span>of a <span class="it-text">log</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of wine, </span>which is equal to half a <span class="it-text">log</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since we require so much </span>wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from here</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rav said: And similarly, </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he said it about this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mishna </span>and the measures mentioned therein. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from this </span>that this is the proper understanding of Rav’s statement. 
The Gemara further examines the mishna cited earlier. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said: And </span>all foods combine to complete the measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">food </span>required <span class="gemarra-regular">for two meals for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rav Yosef thought to say </span>that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may not be established <span class="gemarra-regular">unless there is </span>a complete <span class="gemarra-regular">meal of this </span>kind of food <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a complete <span class="gemarra-regular">meal of that </span>kind of food, meaning that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may only be established if each meal consists of a single type of food. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said to him: </span>An <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may be established with the amount of food required for two meals <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if each type of food made up only <span class="gemarra-regular">half, a third, or a quarter </span>of a meal. 
The Gemara now examines Rav’s statement <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, </span>which was cited in the course of the previous discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: One may establish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with two-quarters </span>of a <span class="it-text">log</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of wine. </span>The following question may be raised: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">need </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so much? Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: </span>The minimal amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">wine </span>required for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">enough to eat </span>bread <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it, </span>i.e., enough to soak the bread in to enable one to eat it? Additionally, the minimal amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">vinegar </span>that may be used to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">enough to dip </span>the food <span class="gemarra-regular">in it, </span>and the minimal amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">olives and onions </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">enough to eat them </span>together with the bread. All of these quantities are calculated on the basis of <span class="gemarra-regular">two meals. </span>This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> clearly indicates that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may be established with much less than two-quarters of a <span class="it-text">log</span> of wine.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to cooked </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wine, </span>which is very strong, and therefore even a small amount suffices.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the minimal amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">vinegar </span>that may be used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is enough to dip </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">in it. Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Giddel said that Rav said: Enough to dip in it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the food of two meals </span>consisting <span class="gemarra-regular">of vegetables. Some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Giddel said that Rav said: </span>Enough to dip in it the <span class="gemarra-regular">vegetables that are eaten in two </span>ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">meals, </span>which is less than the amount consumed in two meals consisting entirely of vegetables. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the minimum measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">olives and onions </span>that may be used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is enough <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat them </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">food of two meals. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">May one establish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with onions? Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Rabbi Meir once </span><span class="gemarra-regular">spent Shabbat in </span>the town of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ardiska</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">certain person came before him </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Rabbi, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I made an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> of Shabbat borders [<span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">teḥumin</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> onions, </span>so that I might walk to the town of <span class="gemarra-regular">Tiv’in. </span>Ardiska was located between the man’s <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> and his destination of Tiv’in, which was beyond his Shabbat limit as measured from his hometown. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Meir made him remain within his four cubits. </span>He forbade him to leave his four cubits, as he held that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> made with onions is not an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, and therefore the person had left his Shabbat limit without an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">teḥumin</span>.
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>ruling, which states that onions may not be used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>onion <span class="gemarra-regular">leaves, </span>which are harmful; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>ruling, which states that onions may be used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>onion <span class="gemarra-regular">bulbs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which are edible. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">ate an onion and died early </span>the next morning, <span class="gemarra-regular">we need not ask from what he died, </span>as his death was certainly caused by the onion. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: They only taught </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the leaves</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; but with regard to </span>onion <span class="gemarra-regular">bulbs, we have no </span>problem <span class="gemarra-regular">with it. And even with regard to the leaves, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we only stated </span>this concern

Daf 29b

in a case where the bulb <span class="gemarra-regular">has not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">grown </span>to the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">a span, </span>the distance between the thumb and the little finger of a hand that is spread apart, because at that stage the leaves are very toxic; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, if it has grown </span>to the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">a span, we have no </span>problem <span class="gemarra-regular">with it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: We only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>this concern about eating onion leaves in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">one did not drink beer </span>afterward; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, if he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">drank beer </span>afterward, <span class="gemarra-regular">we have no </span>problem <span class="gemarra-regular">with it. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person should not eat onion because of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">toxins in it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> There was an incident with Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanina, who ate half an onion and half of its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">toxins, and he fell deathly ill, and his colleagues prayed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for mercy for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he survived. </span>He was rescued only <span class="gemarra-regular">because the time needed him, </span>as his generation was in need of his teaching, but otherwise he would not have recovered.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that Shmuel said: One may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with beer, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and it invalidates a ritual bath with </span>a measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>similar to drawn water. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana strongly</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> objects to this: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious, for what is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the difference between this and dye-water? As we learned </span>in a mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: Dye-water invalidates </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a ritual bath with </span>a measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>like regular drawn water. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said: </span>There is a difference between the two cases, as <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the liquid <span class="gemarra-regular">is called </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dye-water; here, it is called beer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, it might have been possible to argue that beer is not considered like water at all, in which case it would only invalidate a ritual bath if it changed the color of the water, and so Shmuel’s novel teaching was necessary.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much</span> beer is needed to <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rav Aḥa, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son of Rav Yosef, thought to say before Rav Yosef </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Two-quarters </span>of a <span class="it-text">log</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of beer. </span>Rav Aḥa’s reasoning is now spelled out in detail. <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we learned </span>in a mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one carries out wine</span> on Shabbat from a private domain to a public domain, he is liable if he carries out <span class="gemarra-regular">enough </span>wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> diluting a cup, </span>i.e., enough undiluted wine to fill a cup after it has been diluted with water. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught about </span>this mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Enough </span>wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for diluting a fine cup. </span>They inquired: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by <span class="gemarra-regular">a fine cup? </span>They answered: <span class="gemarra-regular">A cup of blessing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And Rav Naḥman said that Rabba bar Avuh said: A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cup of blessing must contain a quarter of a quarter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-</span><span class="it-text">log</span> of wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>after one <span class="gemarra-regular">dilutes </span>the wine with water, <span class="gemarra-regular">it amounts to a </span>full <span class="gemarra-regular">quarter-</span><span class="it-text">log</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this measure is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>with regard to the strength of wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Any wine that is not </span>strong enough to require that it be <span class="gemarra-regular">diluted </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>parts <span class="gemarra-regular">water to one </span>part wine <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>proper <span class="gemarra-regular">wine.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we learned in the latter clause </span>of the aforementioned mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one is liable for carrying out <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">other liquids, and </span>similarly <span class="gemarra-regular">all waste water, </span>in the measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">log</span>. Now, Rav Aḥa argues as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since there, </span>with respect to liability for carrying on Shabbat, the ratio is <span class="gemarra-regular">one to four, </span>as one is liable for carrying out a quarter of a quarter-<span class="it-text">log</span> of wine, and one is only liable for carrying out other liquids if one carries out a quarter-<span class="it-text">log</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">here, too</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with respect to making an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, the ratio of <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to four </span>should be maintained. Therefore, since Rav said that two-quarters of a <span class="it-text">log</span> of wine are required for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, the minimum amount of beer one may use should be two full <span class="it-text">log</span>. 
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is not so. There, </span>with regard to carrying on Shabbat, we require four times as much beer as wine because <span class="gemarra-regular">less than that </span>amount, i.e., less than a quarter-<span class="it-text">log</span> of beer, <span class="gemarra-regular">is insignificant. However, here, </span>with regard to establishing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>relevant, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is common for people to drink a cup </span>of beer <span class="gemarra-regular">in the morning and a cup </span>of beer <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the evening, and they rely on them </span>as their meals, as beer is satisfying even in such quantities. Therefore, we should require only two-quarters of a <span class="it-text">log</span> of beer for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How many</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dates </span>are needed to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>The minimal amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">dates </span>one may use is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rav Yosef said: From where do I say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one inadvertently <span class="gemarra-regular">ate dried figs </span>of <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and paid </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dates </span>in compensation, <span class="gemarra-regular">may a blessing come upon him.</span>
The Gemara proceeds to clarify this ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that one paid <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the value </span>of the figs he ate, e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ate a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zuz</span> worth of figs <span class="gemarra-regular">and he paid a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zuz</span> worth of dates, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the reason it says: <span class="gemarra-regular">May a blessing come upon him? He ate a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zuz</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and paid a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zuz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rather, is it not </span>that he paid <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the measure </span>of the figs eaten, e.g., that <span class="gemarra-regular">he ate a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dried figs worth one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zuz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and he paid a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of dates worth four </span><span class="it-text">zuz</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it says: May</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a blessing come upon him. Apparently, dates are superior </span>to dried figs. Accordingly, since we learned above that one may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with a <span class="it-text">kav</span> of dried figs, a <span class="it-text">kav</span> of dates should certainly suffice for the purpose of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to</span> Rav Yosef: No proof can be brought from here. It can be argued that <span class="gemarra-regular">he actually ate a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zuz</span> worth of figs <span class="gemarra-regular">and he paid a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zuz</span> worth of dates. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>is the reason it says: <span class="gemarra-regular">May a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">blessing come upon him? For he ate something that buyers </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are not eager </span>to buy, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he paid him something </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that buyers are eager </span>to buy. Even though they are equal in value, the priest benefits, for it is easier for him to sell dates than to sell dried figs. 
With regard to <span class="gemarra-italic">shetita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a dish made of roasted flour and honey, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Pineḥas said: Two large </span><span class="gemarra-regular">spoonful</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> are needed for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. With regard to <span class="gemarra-italic">kisanei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a type of roasted grain, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Two Pumbeditan</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">bunei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the name of a particular of measurement.
Having mentioned roasted grain, the Gemara tangentially relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Mother, </span>actually his foster mother, <span class="gemarra-regular">told me: These roasted grains</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are good for the heart and drive away </span>worrisome <span class="gemarra-regular">thoughts</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Abaye said: Mother told me </span>about another remedy. <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who suffers from weakness of the heart should </span>go and <span class="gemarra-regular">bring the meat of the right thigh of a ram</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">bring the dung of grazing cattle from </span>the month of <span class="gemarra-regular">Nisan, and if there is no cattle dung</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he should bring willow twigs, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">roast </span>the meat on a fire made with the dung or twigs, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eat </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and drink afterward </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">diluted wine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This will improve his condition. 
Returning to the matter of quantities of food required for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>The minimum quantity for <span class="gemarra-regular">anything that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">serves as a relis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">enough to eat </span>two meals <span class="gemarra-regular">with it, </span>i.e., enough to serve as a relish for the bread eaten in two meals. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anything that is not a relish, </span>but rather is a food in its own right, one must use <span class="gemarra-regular">enough</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to eat </span>two meals <span class="gemarra-regular">of it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The minimum quantity of <span class="gemarra-regular">raw mea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">enough to eat </span>two meals <span class="gemarra-regular">of it. Roasted meat </span>is the subject of a dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: Enough to eat </span>the bread of two meals <span class="gemarra-regular">with it. </span>That is to say, roasted meat is not a food in itself, but rather it serves as relish for other foods. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yosef said: Enough to eat </span>two meals <span class="gemarra-regular">of it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is a food in its own right.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: From where do I say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">For these Persians eat pieces of </span>roasted <span class="gemarra-regular">meat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tabahakki</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> without bread, </span>which shows that meat itself is a food. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: But are the Persians</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a majority of the world? </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> follows the customary practice of most of the world and not that of particular locales. <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn </span>the following in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Clothing of the poor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., pieces of cloth measuring three by three fingerbreadths, contracts impurity when in the possession of any <span class="gemarra-regular">poor people </span>because poor people attach importance even to scraps of cloth of such small size. <span class="gemarra-regular">Clothing of the wealthy </span>measuring at least three by three handbreadths contracts impurity in all cases, whether or not it is owned by <span class="gemarra-regular">the wealthy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>

Daf 30a

<span class="gemarra-regular">But the clothing of the wealthy </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>need to be three by three handbreadths in order to become ritually impure <span class="gemarra-regular">for the poor </span>because even smaller pieces of cloth are significant for the poor. Therefore, the law with regard to the poor is not determined by the customary practice of the rich. So too, the law of <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> pertaining to the rest of the world should not be determined by the customary practice of the Persians to eat roasted meat as a food in itself. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say: </span>Both <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>the ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">stringent, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>the ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">stringent, </span>i.e., with regard to ritual impurity the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is stringent with respect to the poor and declares scraps of cloth that are only three by three fingerbreadths impure, but with regard to <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> requires enough roasted meat to suffice for two meals as a food in its own right, in accordance with the practice of the Persians, then there is a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: One may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for an ill or elderly </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>an amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">food that is enough for him </span>for two meals, and if he eats less than the average person due to his sickness or age, a smaller amount of food is required in order to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> on his behalf; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, for a glutton, </span>we do not require food in an amount that would satisfy him but merely enough food for two meals measured according to <span class="gemarra-regular">an average meal for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the typical person? </span>This indicates that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with respect to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is lenient and not stringent. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult.</span>
The Gemara raises a difficulty with the aforementioned <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did Rabbi Shimon ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? Wasn’t it taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span> pertaining to the laws of ritual impurity that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon ben Elazar says: Og, king of the Bashan, </span>or any similar giant, requires an <span class="gemarra-regular">opening as </span>big as <span class="gemarra-regular">his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> full size? </span>If a person dies in a house and it is not clear how his corpse will be removed, all of the openings in the house are considered ritually impure, as the corpse might be carried out through any one of them. If the corpse can fit through some of the openings but not through others, only the larger openings are ritually impure. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says that in the case of a giant the size of Og, king of the Bashan, one opening can only prevent the others from contracting impurity the others if it is large enough for Og’s corpse to fit through. This indicates that the law is determined by the measure of each particular person and not by some general measure.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what does <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span>say? How does he reconcile his position with regard to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, which maintains that we follow the customary practice of most of the world and not that of particular locales, with Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar’s ruling with regard to the corpse of a giant? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of a giant, <span class="gemarra-regular">what should we do? Should we cut </span>the corpse <span class="gemarra-regular">into pieces and carry it out? </span>We have no choice but to carry it out through an opening large enough for the corpse to pass through. However, in the case of the food for the two meals of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, there is no such logistical constraint, and the law should be determined in accordance with the usual practice. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not? Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar bar Ḥana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Og, king </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the Bashan, </span>requires <span class="gemarra-regular">an opening of four </span>handbreadths in order to save the other openings in the house from becoming ritually impure. This indicates that the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>we are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are many small openings, and there is</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">one that is four </span>handbreadths wide. Therefore, it may be assumed <span class="gemarra-regular">with certainty that when one widens </span>one of the openings in order to remove the corpse from the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">he will widen that </span>opening. Consequently, that opening is ritually impure while the others are not. However, if all the openings in the house are equal in size, they are all ritually impure, as we cannot know through which opening the corpse will be carried out.
Returning to the laws of <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya bar Rav Ashi said that Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: One may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with raw meat </span>because it can be eaten when necessary, even though it is not ordinarily regarded as food. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: One may </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with raw eggs. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How many </span>eggs are required for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: One. Sinai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a nickname of Rav Yosef, <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Two</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who vows</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that nourishment </span>is prohibited to him <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span>and salt. The Gemara infers from this: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">salt and water </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">are not considered nourishment, but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all </span>other food <span class="gemarra-regular">items are considered nourishment. Let us say</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is a refutation of </span>the position of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Shmuel. As it was Rav and Shmuel who both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: One only recites the blessing: Who creates </span>the various <span class="gemarra-regular">kinds of nourishment, over the five species </span>of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">alone</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>but not over other types of food. 
The Gemara asks a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did we not </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">refute </span>their position <span class="gemarra-regular">on one occasion </span>from a different source? The Gemara answers: Indeed, we already refuted their view, but <span class="gemarra-regular">let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a refutation of their</span> position <span class="gemarra-regular">from here as well. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: </span>We can resolve the difficulty from the mishna by saying that it is referring to someone who vows and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Anything that nourishes </span>is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">to me. </span>In that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is water and salt</span> that are permitted to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they do not nourish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but all </span>other food <span class="gemarra-regular">items </span>are prohibited, as they <span class="gemarra-regular">do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nourish. </span>This inclusive formulation includes anything that provides even a small degree of nourishment; but the particular term <span class="it-text">mazon</span>, nourishment or sustenance, used in the blessing over food, is reserved only for the five species of grain.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar bar Ḥana say: When we were following Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to eat of the fruits of Genosar, </span>very sweet fruits that grow in the region of the Sea of Galilee, <span class="gemarra-regular">when we were </span>a group <span class="gemarra-regular">of a hundred </span>people, <span class="gemarra-regular">each</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and every </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">would take ten </span>fruits; and <span class="gemarra-regular">when we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were </span>a group <span class="gemarra-regular">of ten, each and every </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> take a hundred </span>fruits for him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And each hundred of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these </span>fruits <span class="gemarra-regular">could not fit into a three-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> basket. And </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">would eat them all and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">say: I swear that I have not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">tasted something</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that nourishes. </span>Didn’t we say that only water and salt are excluded from the category of things that nourish? The Gemara corrects the rendition of the story: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that he said as follows: I have not tasted <span class="gemarra-regular">sustaining </span><span class="gemarra-regular">food, </span>but fruit is certainly considered something that nourishes.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>If one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I swear that I shall not eat this loaf, one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may </span>nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for him with it </span>because the food used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> does not have to be edible for the particular individual the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> services. However, if one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This loaf </span>shall be forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for him with it, </span>as this formulation indicates that he is prohibiting himself to use or benefit from the loaf in any manner.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>based upon the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>not to benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from a loaf, one may </span>nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him with it. What, is it not </span>referring to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who said: </span>This loaf shall be forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is only is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said: </span>I swear that I shall not eat <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>loaf.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, it is reasonable </span>to understand the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in this fashion, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> latter clause: When </span>do we apply this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Only <span class="gemarra-regular">when</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one said: I swear that I shall not taste it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>This loaf shall be forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, one may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him with it. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">if so, </span>there is a difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">Instead of teaching </span>in the continuation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that if one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This loaf is consecrated </span>property, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for him with it, as one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with consecrated </span>objects, <span class="gemarra-regular">let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him make </span>an internal <span class="gemarra-regular">distinction in the case </span>of a non-sacred loaf <span class="gemarra-regular">itself </span>and state: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this statement said? </span>Only where <span class="gemarra-regular">one said: </span>I swear that I shall not eat <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>loaf. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if one said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>This loaf shall be forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me, one may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for him with it. </span>This indicates that Rav Huna’s understanding of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is incorrect.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Huna </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: Rather, what </span>would you say, that <span class="gemarra-regular">wherever </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>This loaf shall be forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me, one may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for him with it? If so, there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty </span>from the <span class="gemarra-regular">first</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states: When do we say this? Only when one said: I swear that I shall not taste it. That indicates that if one said: This loaf shall be forbidden to me, one may not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for him with it. 
The Gemara answers that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete, and it teaches the following: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>not to benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">loaf, one may </span>nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for him with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it. And even if one said: </span>This loaf shall be forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me, it is as though he said: I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">swear that I shall not taste it. </span>Therefore, the loaf itself is only forbidden to him as food, but he can use it for the purpose of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Nevertheless, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">difficulty </span>remains <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He stated </span>his view <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer; as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>If one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I swear </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that I shall not eat this loaf, one may establish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for him with it; </span>but if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This loaf </span>shall be forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me, one may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for him with it.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did Rabbi Eliezer </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the principle: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibits </span><span class="gemarra-regular">himself from </span>eating a particular <span class="gemarra-regular">food, </span>e.g., if one said: I swear that I shall not eat this loaf, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for him with </span>that loaf. However, if the <span class="gemarra-regular">food was prohibited to a person, </span>e.g., if he said: This loaf shall be forbidden to me, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with it. Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>If he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This loaf </span>shall be forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me, one may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for him with it. </span>However, if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This loaf </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is consecrated </span>property, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him with it, as one may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for him with consecrated </span>objects. Therefore, Rabbi Eliezer does not distinguish between the two differently worded types of vows, but between a vow and consecration. 
The Gemara answers: It must be explained that these are <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span> who both held <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Eliezer. </span>Two later <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> disagreed with each other in reporting Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion. 
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nazirite with win</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and for an Israelite with <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, even though they themselves may not partake of these foods. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>taught <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai, as it was taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: One may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for a nazirite with wine and for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an Israelite with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Beit Hillel </span>disagree and <span class="gemarra-regular">say: One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for a nazirite with wine and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for an Israelite with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Beit Hillel said to Beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shammai: Do you not concede </span>

Daf 30b

<span class="gemarra-regular">that one may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for an adult </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">on Yom Kippur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> despite the fact that he may not eat on Yom Kippur? It must be because eating is permitted to a minor. 
Beit Shammai <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Indeed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aval</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is so. Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Just</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as one may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for an adult on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yom Kippur, so </span>too, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a nazirite with wine and for an Israelite with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how do <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai </span>explain the difference between these cases? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>with regard to Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is</span> at least <span class="gemarra-regular">a meal that was fit </span>to be eaten by that person <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day, </span>on the eve of Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>in the cases of wine for a nazirite and <span class="it-text">teruma</span> for an Israelite, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no meal that was fit </span>to be eaten by them <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day, </span>on Friday.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion was that entire <span class="it-text">baraita</span> stated? It was <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>taught <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya, as it was taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya says: The whole </span>view <span class="gemarra-regular">of Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shammai, </span>i.e., their fundamental position, was that <span class="gemarra-regular">they did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not concede to </span>the very possibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">joining </span>Shabbat borders [<span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">teḥumin</span>] by simply placing food in a particular location. Rather, they hold that one’s Shabbat residence remains the same <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>he literally moves his residence, such as if <span class="gemarra-regular">he carries out his bed and his utensils to there, </span>to a new location. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">that was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in black </span>clothing, and Shabbat commenced while he was still dressed those clothes, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not go out in white </span>clothing. If one established the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> while dressed <span class="gemarra-regular">in white,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he may not go out in black. According to whose</span> opinion is this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">with black </span>clothing that <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not go out, but in white </span>clothing <span class="gemarra-regular">he may go out? Didn’t </span>Ḥananya <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that according to Beit Shammai an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is not effective at all <span class="gemarra-regular">until one carries out his bed and his utensils </span>to the place he wishes to establish as his residence? The Gemara answers: The wording of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> must be emended and <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what it said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one established an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> while dressed <span class="gemarra-regular">in white </span>clothing, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he needed black</span> clothing but did not have it with him, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not go out even in white </span>clothing. <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whose </span>opinion was this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> taught? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yitzḥak said: It is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai.</span>
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Summakhos </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>One may not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for an Israelite with <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, but only <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>regular, <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred </span>food items. The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to the mishna’s ruling that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may be established for <span class="gemarra-regular">a nazirite with wine, </span>Summakhos <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>appear to <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree. What is the reason </span>for the distinction? The Gemara explains: A nazirite <span class="gemarra-regular">can ask</span> a Sage to annul his vow and release him from <span class="gemarra-regular">his nazirite status</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and then he himself will be able to drink the wine.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as well</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, one can ask </span>a Sage to annul <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>status. <span class="it-text">Teruma</span> is consecrated through a verbal declaration by the one separating it, and that declaration, like other consecrations and vows, can be nullified by a Sage. The Gemara answers: Such a course of action would not help. <span class="gemarra-regular">If one asks </span>a Sage to annul his declaration that turned the produce into <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">will return to </span>its status as <span class="gemarra-italic">tevel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>produce from which the requisite dues and tithes were not separated, and he will still be prohibited to consume it. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him separate </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>that produce <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>produce located <span class="gemarra-regular">somewhere else </span>and thus permit it to be eaten. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-italic">Ḥaverim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>members of a group dedicated to the precise observance of mitzvot, <span class="gemarra-regular">are not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> suspected of separating </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> from produce that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>situated <span class="gemarra-regular">near </span>the produce it comes to exempt,as this is prohibited <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him separate </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the produce used for the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">itself </span>and consequently permit the rest of the produce to be eaten. The Gemara answers: We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where, </span>after removing <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">it would not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> contain the amount </span>required for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, i.e., one would be left with less than the quantity of food sufficient for two meals. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>makes it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> to say that the mishna is referring to this very unique case? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>we must retract all that was stated above and say as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Summakhos agrees with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, who say: Anything that is </span>prohibited on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">due to a rabbinic decree [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shevut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">issued </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the decree </span>to apply even <span class="gemarra-regular">during twilight. </span>Even though this period is of questionable status with regard to whether it is day or night, the Shabbat restrictions instituted by the Sages apply then as they do on Shabbat itself. Consequently, since it is prohibited to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> on Shabbat, it is prohibited during the twilight period as well. Therefore, during twilight, when the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> would go into effect, it is impossible to cause it to become permitted to an Israelite. 
The Gemara now asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the following mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span> with regard to which <span class="gemarra-regular">they stated </span>that measures <span class="gemarra-regular">are all in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with the </span>particular <span class="gemarra-regular">person </span>involved, e.g, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">handful of </span>flour that a priest scoops out from <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">meal-offering, and the handfuls of incense </span>the High Priest would offer on Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who drinks a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cheekful on Yom Kippur, and with regard to the </span>measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">two meals’ </span>worth of <span class="gemarra-regular">nourishment for an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>All these measures are determined by the particular individual involved. <span class="gemarra-regular">In</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with whose </span>opinion is this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Summakhos, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who said: We require that which is fit for him, </span>the particular individual, and we do not follow a standard measure. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the aforementioned mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar. As it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: One may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for an ill or elderly</span> person <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>an amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">food that is enough for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him </span>for two meals; and if he eats less than the average amount due to his sickness or age, a smaller amount of food is sufficient. <span class="gemarra-regular">But for a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">glutton </span>we do not require food in an amount that would satisfy him; we measure on the basis of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">average meal for the typical person</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara answers: When the mishna says that the measure of food for two meals is determined by the particular person involved, <span class="gemarra-regular">interpret </span>that as referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">an ill or elderly </span>person. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a glutton, </span>we do not determine the measure of food by his standard for a different reason, namely because <span class="gemarra-regular">his opinion is rendered irrelevant by the opinions of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all other people. </span>Therefore, there is no reason to be stringent with him and determine the measure according to his particular needs.
We learned in the mishna: One may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for a priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">haperas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> an area in which there is doubt concerning the location of a grave or a corpse. The Gemara explains that the reason for this is as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>In a time of need <span class="gemarra-regular">a person may blow </span>on the dust in a <span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">hapera</span><span class="gemarra-italic">s</span> before taking each step, so that if there is a bone beneath the dust he will expose it and avoid it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he may thus <span class="gemarra-regular">walk </span>across the area. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda bar Ami said in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the name of Rav Yehuda: A </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">haperas</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">been trodden </span>underfoot, creating a path, <span class="gemarra-regular">is pure, </span>as we assume that it no longer contains any bones as large as a kernel of barley. Both of these statements indicate that the ritual impurity of a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">haperas</span> is a stringency decreed by the Sages. Therefore, since there is a way to avoid becoming ritually impure there, even a priest may place his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in a <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">haperas</span>. 
We learned in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>An <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may be established for a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a cemetery, </span>an area which the priest may not enter by Torah law. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught: </span>This is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">can interpose and walk </span>between the graves inside <span class="gemarra-regular">a carriage, a crate, or a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cupboard. </span>These containers do not contract impurity because of their large size, and anything found inside of them remains pure. From here we see that <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds </span>the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">A moving tent is called a tent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span>and therefore the carriage, box, or cupboard are also considered tents. They shield a person carried in them from the impurity imparted by the graves in a cemetery. 
The Gemara notes that this matter is the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">a dispute between the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">following </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who enters the land of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nations, </span>i.e., any territory outside Eretz Yisrael, not on foot, but <span class="gemarra-regular">in a carriage, a crate, or a cupboard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>him ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure. Rabbi Yosei, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi Yehuda, renders </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">pure. </span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they disagree? One Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> moving tent is not called a tent. </span>The principle is that only something fixed can shield against ritual impurity, but if one is situated inside a portable vessel, the vessel contracts impurity and he becomes impure along with it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a moving tent is called a tent, </span>and it shields the person inside from contracting ritual impurity. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>

Daf 31a

<span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for a priest who is </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">pure with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">pure </span>and resting <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a grave, </span>even though the location is impure and he cannot reach it. <span class="gemarra-regular">How does he go </span>there? <span class="gemarra-regular">In a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> carriage, crate, or cupboard, </span>which shield him from the ritual impurity. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>it true that <span class="gemarra-regular">once</span> the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was placed </span>directly on the grave, the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">became defiled, </span>and ritually impure <span class="it-text">teruma</span> is not fit to be eaten by anyone? The Gemara answers: We are dealing here with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">had not yet</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> been rendered susceptible </span>to ritual impurity, as it had not yet come into contact with a liquid. Produce that has yet to come into contact with a liquid does not contract impurity. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>we are dealing with bread <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was kneaded with fruit juice, </span>which is not one of the seven liquids that render a food susceptible to ritual impurity.
The Gemara now asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he bring it </span>from where it is resting on the grave in order to eat it? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> flat wooden utensils </span>that are not shaped as receptacles and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">do not contract </span>ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t </span>the utensil <span class="gemarra-regular">cover </span>the grave? The Sages decreed that anyone who holds a utensil that is a handbreadth wide over a corpse or grave is ritually impure. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He may bring it on the edg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the utensil while holding the utensil sideways so that it does not form a cover that is a handbreadth wide over the grave. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">so, </span>and there is a way for the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> to remain ritually pure and for the priest to access it, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>the Sages disagreed with Rabbi Yehuda and did not allow an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> to be established for a priest on a grave? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">They hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited to acquire a home with items </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from which benefit is prohibited. </span>It is prohibited to derive benefit from a grave. Since one acquires a place of residence for Shabbat by means of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, it would be as if the priest acquired a home for himself with something from which he may not derive benefit. 
The Gemara asks: If so, does this prove <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>to acquire a home with items from which benefit is prohibited? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot were not given for benefit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The fulfillment of a mitzva is not in itself considered a benefit. Since the acquisition of a place of residence by means of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is a mitzva, as one may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">teḥumin</span> only for the sake of a mitzva, it is even permitted to establish one’s <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in a place from which it is prohibited to benefit. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if so, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which Rava said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Mitzvot were not given for benefit, let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he stated his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of one side in a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they hold that one may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the sake of a mitzva, all would agree </span>that the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may be placed on a grave because <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not given for benefit. </span>However, the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Sages centers on a different aspect of the issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, they disagree with regard to this: One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: One may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for the sake of a mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since mitzvot do not constitute forbidden benefit, it is therefore permitted to make use of the grave. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one Sage, </span>i.e., the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: One may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even for a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">voluntary matter. </span>Establishing a Shabbat residence on the site of a grave by means of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> made for a voluntary matter is regarded as forbidden benefit, and therefore it is prohibited. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if so, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which Rav Yosef said </span>as a general principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only for the sake of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzva, let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he stated his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>one side in a dispute between the <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>In fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">all agree </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only for the sake of a mitzva, and all agree</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot were not given for benefit, and they disagree</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to this: One Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: Once</span> he <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired his </span>Shabbat residence at twilight by means of the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he is indifferent to its safeguarding, </span>as his main goal has already been achieved. He has no further need for the food used for the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, and therefore, he receives no benefit from its placement on the grave. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one Sage, </span>i.e., the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is pleasing to him that </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is safeguarded, for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if he needs </span>it the next day, <span class="gemarra-regular">he can eat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it. </span>According to this opinion, he would be making prohibited use of the grave to preserve his meal for the following day, and therefore the Sages prohibited placing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> on a grave. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> produce purchased from one who may not have separated the required tithes, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>similarly, one may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first tithe whose </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has been taken </span>in order to be given to a priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second tithe and consecrated articles that have been redeemed; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and priests </span>may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the portion of dough that must be given to a priest.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tevel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>produce from which the priestly dues [<span class="it-text">teruma</span>] and other tithes have not been separated, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first tithe whose </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which must be given to a priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">has not been taken, nor with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tithe or consecrated articles that have not been redeemed.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: How can one establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with <span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Isn’t it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unfit for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Since it is prohibited to eat <span class="it-text">demai</span>, how can it be used as an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since if he wants, he could declare his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">property ownerless, and he would be a poor </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> the <span class="it-text">demai</span> would then <span class="gemarra-regular">be fit for him, </span>as a poor person is permitted to eat <span class="it-text">demai</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">now too, </span>even though he has not renounced ownership of his property, <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for him </span>to use as an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may feed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the poor </span><span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span>

Daf 31b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one may also feed <span class="gemarra-regular">soldiers </span><span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: It was taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: One may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> feed the impoverished </span><span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And Beit Hillel say: One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may feed the impoverished </span><span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel.
We learned in the mishna: One may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first tithe </span>whose <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">has been taken. </span>The Gemara expresses surprise: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is obvious </span>that if the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> was already taken there is no problem. Why is it necessary to state it may be used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is only necessary </span>to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case where the Levite <span class="gemarra-regular">preceded </span>the priest while the grain was still <span class="gemarra-regular">on the stalks, </span>i.e., the Levite took his tithe before the grain was threshed and before the priest took the <span class="it-text">teruma</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of the tithes was taken from it </span>but <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">gedola</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was not taken from it. </span>Therefore, since the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> is generally separated first, a portion of the first tithe that the Levite took should have been separated as <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu </span>said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said, as Rabbi Abbahu </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: First tithe, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the Levite <span class="gemarra-regular">preceded </span>the priest while the grain was still <span class="gemarra-regular">on the stalks</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is exempt from </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">gedola</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And you shall set apart from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it a gift for the Lord, even a tenth part </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the tithe” </span>(Numbers 18:26), from which the following inference is made: <span class="gemarra-regular">A tenth part of the tithe, </span>i.e., the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe, <span class="gemarra-regular">I told you, </span>the Levite, to separate. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>I did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>tell you to separate <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">gedola</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the tithe. </span>
With regard to this matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abaye: If so, even </span>if the Levite <span class="gemarra-regular">preceded </span>the priest after the kernels of grain were removed from the stalks and placed <span class="gemarra-regular">in a pile, </span>the Levite should still not have to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="it-text">gedola</span>. Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: With</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to your </span>claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “From all that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is given to you, you shall set apart that which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the Lord’s </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Numbers 18:29). The inclusive phrase “from all” indicates that <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="it-text">gedola</span> must be separated even from the first tithe in the case where the Levite precedes the priest after the grain has been collected in a pile. 
Rav Pappa asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you see </span>that led you to expound one verse as exempting the Levite from separating <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="it-text">gedola</span> from first tithe that has been separated while the grain was on the stalks, and to expound another verse as requiring <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="it-text">gedola</span> to be separated when the Levite took his first tithe after the grain was collected in a pile? Abaye answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>produce, which has been threshed and placed into piles, is completely processed and <span class="gemarra-regular">has become grain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and that </span>produce, which remained on the stalks, <span class="gemarra-regular">did not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">become</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> grain. </span>The wording of the biblical verses indicates that the requirement to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> applies only to grain, whereas the produce is not considered grain until it has been threshed. 
The mishna also stated that one may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second tithe and consecrated </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have been redeemed. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is obvious </span>that these foods may be used to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. The Gemara answers: This ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">was only needed </span>for a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one </span>redeemed the second tithe or consecrated food and <span class="gemarra-regular">paid the principle but did not pay the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">fifth </span>of their value, which must be paid when they are redeemed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the failure to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">fifth does not invalidate </span>the redemption. Once the principle is paid, even if payment of the additional fifth is still outstanding, the article is regarded as redeemed and may be used for mundane purposes. 
The mishna further states: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>one may not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tevel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>produce from which the priestly dues and other tithes have not been separated. The Gemara asks: This too is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious, </span>as it is prohibited to eat or derive any benefit from <span class="it-text">tevel</span>. The Gemara answers: This ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is only needed with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tevel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is considered </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tevel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by rabbinic decree. </span>What is included in this category? <span class="gemarra-regular">For example, if one planted </span>seeds <span class="gemarra-regular">in an imperforated container</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one is exempt by Torah law from separting <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes from the resulting produce because Torah law does not consider produce grown in such a container to have grown from the ground. 
The mishna stated that one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with first tithe whose </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has not been</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taken. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is obvious, </span>as such produce is <span class="it-text">tevel</span>. The Gemara answers: This ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is only</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> needed </span>for a case where the Levite <span class="gemarra-regular">preceded </span>the priest and took first tithe from <span class="gemarra-regular">the pile, and </span>only <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the tithe was taken from it, </span>but <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">gedola</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was not taken from it, </span>and the produce is therefore still <span class="it-text">tevel</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in that case is <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Pappa said to Abaye, </span>and the Levite is exempt from separating <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="it-text">gedola</span>, and therefore the food may be used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us as </span>Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">responded to </span>Rav Pappa: If the Levite takes grain after it had been gathered in a pile, he must separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="it-text">gedola</span>. Until he does so the produce may not be eaten. 
We also learned in the mishna that one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second tithe or consecrated </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">that have not been redeemed. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious </span>that these items may not be used. 
The Gemara answers: This ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is only needed </span>for a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he redeemed them, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">did not redeem them properly, </span>e.g., in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">second tithe that was redeemed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with an unminted coin [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">asimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And the Torah says</span> with regard to the redemption of the second tithe: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bind up [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vetzarta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the money </span>in your hand” (Deuteronomy 14:25). This is expounded to mean that the second tithe may only be redeemed with <span class="gemarra-regular">money that has a form [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzura</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>engraved <span class="gemarra-regular">upon it; </span>however, unminted coins are not considered money for the purpose of redeeming the second tithe. 
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated property</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the reference is to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one redeemed it</span> by exchanging it <span class="gemarra-regular">for land </span>instead of money, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Torah states: “He will give the money and it shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> become his.</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> Since the verse speaks of giving money, it may be inferred that consecrated property cannot be redeemed by giving the Temple treasury land of equivalent value. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">one sends his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the hands of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, </span>all of whom are regarded as legally incompetent, <span class="gemarra-regular">or in the hands</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of one who does not accept </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> But <span class="gemarra-regular">if one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> told another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">to receive it from him </span>at a specific location and set it down in that spot, <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The critical point in the establishment of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is that it must be deposited in the proper location by a competent person; but it is immaterial how the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> arrives there.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a minor not </span>fit to set down an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t Rav Huna say: A minor may collect the </span>food for an <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> from the residents of a courtyard and establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> on their behalf even <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>? The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>where the mishna invalidates an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> placed by a minor, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">borders. </span>These laws are relatively stringent, as they require that one establish a new place of residence, which a minor cannot do. <span class="gemarra-regular">There</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>where Rav Huna said that a minor may collect the food for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, he was referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of courtyards</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This type of <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is more lenient and may be established even by a minor, as all that is necessary is to join together domains that already exist.
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>if one sends his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in the hands of one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not accept </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: A Samaritan [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Kuti</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>who does not accept the laws of the Sages with regard to <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
The mishna also states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he told another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">to receive </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from him, it is a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara challenges this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us be concerned </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that perhaps </span>the minor or other incompetent person will <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bring </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> to the other person. The Gemara responds: This may be answered <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Ḥisda said </span>with regard to a different statement, that it was referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he stands and watches him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Here, too, </span>the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the person sending the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">stands and watches him </span>from afar until the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> reaches the person designated to receive it. 
The Gemara asks: But nonetheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us be concerned that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the other person will <span class="gemarra-regular">not take </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the deaf-mute, imbecile, or minor and deposit it in the designated place. From a distance, one cannot see exactly what is happening. He only saw that the messenger arrived at his destination. The Gemara answers this question <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yeḥiel said </span>in a different context that there is a legal <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an agent fulfills his agency. Here, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">too, </span>there is a legal <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">agent </span>appointed to accept the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">fulfills his agency.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where were </span>these principles of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda and Rav Yeḥiel stated? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were stated with regard to </span>the following, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one gave </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a trained <span class="gemarra-regular">elephant, and it brought it </span>to the place where he wanted the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> deposited, or if he gave it <span class="gemarra-regular">to a monkey</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and it brought it </span>to the proper location, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if he told another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">to receive it from </span>the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> perhaps </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">will not bring </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the person appointed to receive it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the person sending the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">stands and watches it </span>from afar until it reaches the person designated to receive the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. The Gemara asks further: But <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the person appointed to receive the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">will not accept it from </span>the elephant or monkey. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yeḥiel said: </span>There is a legal <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">agent fulfills his agency.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: With </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to Torah </span>laws, we do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>rely on the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption that an agent fulfills his agency; </span>rather, one must actually see the agent performing his mission. 

Daf 32a

However, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to rabbinic </span>laws, we do rely on the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an agent fulfills </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his agency</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And Rav Sheshet </span>disagreed and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">both this, </span>Torah law, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that, </span>rabbinic law, we rely on the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an agent fulfills </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his agency.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: From where do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I say this? As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Once </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">omer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has been offered, </span>the grain from <span class="gemarra-regular">the new </span><span class="gemarra-regular">crop is immediately permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Torah prohibits eating from the new crop of grain until the <span class="it-text">omer</span> sacrifice is offered on the second day of Passover (Leviticus 23:14); once the <span class="it-text">omer</span> is offered, it is immediately permitted to partake of the new grain. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And those far </span>from Jerusalem, who do not know whether or not the <span class="it-text">omer</span> has already been offered, <span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted </span>to eat from the new crop <span class="gemarra-regular">from midday and on, </span>as the <span class="it-text">omer</span> must surely have been offered by this time. <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>the prohibition to eat from <span class="gemarra-regular">the new </span>crop <span class="gemarra-regular">a Torah law? And </span>nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught: And those far </span>from Jerusalem <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to eat from the new crop <span class="gemarra-regular">from midday and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on. Is this not because </span>we may rely on the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an agent fulfills his agency? </span>The priests in the Temple serve as the agents of the entire Jewish people, and it may be assumed that they have performed the mission entrusted to them. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman, </span>who holds that with respect to Torah laws we may not rely on the presumption that an agent fulfills his agency, refute this proof? He can respond as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the agents may be trusted for <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason that was </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: Because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we know that the court will not be indolent </span>in offering the <span class="it-text">omer</span> sacrifice; however, the same cannot be said of ordinary agents.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>a different version of this response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: From where do I say this</span> principle? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we know that the court will not be indolent </span>in offering the <span class="it-text">omer</span> past midday. From this we may infer: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is the court </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">will not be indolent </span>with regard to missions entrusted to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>an ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">agent</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">be indolent </span>with regard to his mission. Therefore, we cannot rely upon an ordinary agent. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Sheshet </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you</span> that this is not the correct inference; rather, we should infer as follows: It is only <span class="gemarra-regular">the court </span>that is presumed to have executed its mission <span class="gemarra-regular">by midday, </span>even though the mitzva to bring the <span class="it-text">omer</span> offering lasts all day. However, an ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">agent, </span>who is not as diligent, is only presumed to have completed his mission by the end of <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire day.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: From where do I say </span>my opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> woman who is responsible </span>to offer sacrifices following <span class="gemarra-regular">childbirth or</span> after experiencing <span class="gemarra-italic">ziv</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> (Leviticus 12, 15) <span class="gemarra-regular">brings money and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> puts it in </span>the appropriate collection <span class="gemarra-regular">bo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">x</span> in the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">immerses </span>in a ritual bath, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>she may then <span class="gemarra-regular">eat sacrificial food at nightfall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What is the reason </span>that she is permitted to eat immediately at nightfall? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it not because we say </span>that there is a <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">an agent fulfills his agency, </span>and the priests certainly purchased the appropriate sacrifices with her money and offered them during the day? 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman </span>counter this proof? <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of a woman who put money in the box, the reason she may rely on agency is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shemaya, as Rav Shemaya said: </span>There is a legal <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the court of priests would not leave</span> the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">until all the money in the </span>collection <span class="gemarra-regular">box</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has been spent </span>on the purchase of sacrifices. We may rely only on the special court appointed to carry out this task, as it can be trusted. However, no proof may be brought from here with regard to an ordinary agent. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sheshet said </span>another proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do I say this? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who says </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to another </span>person: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go and gather for yourself figs from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> my fig tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if he does not specify the amount that he should take, the gatherer <span class="gemarra-regular">may eat casually from them </span>even without separating tithes. However, if one wishes to eat the figs as a regular, set meal, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them </span>as fruit that is known <span class="gemarra-regular">with certainty </span>not to previously be tithed. In this case, it may be assumed that the owner of the fig tree did not separate tithes to exempt these figs, as he did not know how many the gatherer would take. However, if the owner of the fig tree said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Fill this basket</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for yourself with figs from my fig tree, he may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eat from them casually </span>without tithing, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>before eating them as a regular meal, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must tithe them </span>as <span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>produce with regard to which we are unsure if the appropriate tithes have been separated. Since the owner of the tree knows how many figs the gatherer will take, it is possible that he has already separated tithes for these figs. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">In </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>Where the owner of the fig tree is <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">am</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha’aretz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. But </span>if he is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the gatherer <span class="gemarra-regular">may eat </span>the figs, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he need not tithe </span>them even as <span class="it-text">demai</span>, as the owner certainly separated tithes for them from other produce; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. His father, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, says </span>the opposite: <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>Where the owner of the fig tree is an <span class="gemarra-italic">am</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha’aretz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. But </span>if he is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the gatherer <span class="gemarra-regular">may not eat </span>the fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">until he tithes </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaverim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who are meticulous in their observance of <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">are not suspected of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> separating </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> and tithes <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>produce that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not adjacent</span> to the produce they seek to exempt. Since the figs that have been picked are not adjacent to the owner’s other figs, he has certainly not separated <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes on their account. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: My statement appears </span>to be more correct <span class="gemarra-regular">than Father’s statement: It is better that</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaverim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should be suspected of separating </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>produce that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not adjacent </span>to the produce they seek to exempt, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they should not feed </span><span class="gemarra-italic">amei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’aretz</span> produce that is <span class="gemarra-italic">tevel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara infers: The <span class="it-text">tanna</span><span class="it-text">’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagreed only </span>with regard to the following point: <span class="gemarra-regular">That one Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="it-text">ḥaverim</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> suspected </span>of tithing with produce that is not adjacent to the produce it comes to exempt, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one Sage, </span>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are not suspected </span>of that. <span class="gemarra-regular">But all </span>agree that we may rely on the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an agent fulfills his agency, </span>i.e., that the owner, who is regarded as an agent to tithe his produce so that no one will eat <span class="it-text">tevel</span> on his account, can be relied upon to separate the tithes. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman </span>can respond as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the owner can be trusted, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanina Ḥoza’a, as Rav Ḥanina Ḥoza’a said: There</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a legal <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption with regard to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaver</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that he does not release anything that is not tithed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from his possession. </span>Therefore, we are not relying on a general presumption with regard to agents but on a presumption with regard to <span class="it-text">ḥaverim</span>. 
The previous <span class="it-text">baraita</span> contained several puzzling elements. Now that the Gemara has completed its primary discussion, namely the presumption that an agent carries out his mission, it turns to a discussion of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Master said: </span>If one said to his fellow: Go and gather for yourself figs, <span class="gemarra-regular">in what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is in a case where the owner of the fig tree is <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">am</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha’aretz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. However, </span>if he is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the gatherer <span class="gemarra-regular">may eat </span>the figs, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he need not tithe </span>them; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-italic">am</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha’aretz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who addressed his fellow man, <span class="gemarra-regular">to whom did he speak? If you say that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he spoke to his fellow </span><span class="gemarra-italic">am</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha’aretz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>if so how are we to understand the statement that follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must tithe them as </span><span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Would </span>an <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">comply </span>with the admonition of the Sages to suspect that the produce of his fellow <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span> may not have been tithed? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this must be referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">am</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha’aretz</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who told a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaver</span> to gather figs from his fig tree, and the <span class="it-text">ḥaver</span> will certainly tithe them. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">My statement appears </span>to be more correct <span class="gemarra-regular">than </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Father’s statement, </span>means the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is better that</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaverim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should be suspected of separating </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>produce that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not adjacent </span>to the produce they seek to exempt, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they should not feed </span><span class="gemarra-italic">amei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’aretz</span> produce that is <span class="gemarra-italic">tevel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. What is the relevance of</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">amei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha’aretz</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there? </span>According to that explanation, the situation is the opposite. The person eating the figs is a <span class="it-text">ḥaver</span>, and the owner of the fig tree is an <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: The first clause </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">am</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha’aretz</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who spoke to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> latter clause </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaver</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who spoke </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">am</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha’aretz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and a different </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaver</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> heard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him </span>speak, and the discussion relates not to the one gathering the figs but to whether the second <span class="it-text">ḥaver</span> may partake of the figs if they are offered to him. The Gemara explains the disagreement according to this understanding: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span> Yehuda HaNasi

Daf 32b

<span class="gemarra-regular">holds: That </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who heard the first <span class="it-text">ḥaver</span> speaking to the <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha</span><span class="it-text">’aretz</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span>immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">eat </span>from the basket, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not required to tithe </span>the produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the first</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaver</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> certainly separated tithes for </span>the person who picked the figs, as he would not have caused an <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span> to eat <span class="it-text">tevel</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>That <span class="it-text">ḥaver</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">may not eat </span>of the fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">until he has tithed </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaverim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> suspected of separating </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>produce that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not adjacent </span>to the produce they seek to exempt. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: It is better that</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaverim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should be suspected of separating </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>produce that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not adjacent </span>to the produce they seek to exempt, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they should not feed </span><span class="gemarra-italic">amei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’aretz</span> produce that is <span class="gemarra-italic">tevel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what</span> principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do they disagree? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: It is preferable to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaver</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">commit a minor transgression</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> namely separating tithes from produce that is not adjacent to the produce they seek to exempt, so that <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">am</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha’aretz</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will not commit </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">major transgression </span>of eating <span class="it-text">tevel</span> on his account. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds: It is preferable to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaver</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">am</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha’aretz</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> commit a major transgression</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and that he </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">not commit even a minor transgression</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">one placed </span>his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in a tre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> above ten handbreadths </span>from the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">below ten handbreadths, his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he placed </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in a pit, even</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">it was a hundred cubits deep, his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is</span> a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba sat, and </span>with him sat <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi and Rava bar Natan, and Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman sat beside them, and they sat and said: This</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tree </span>mentioned in the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">where does it stand? If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you say it stands in the private domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what</span> is the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>whether the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is placed <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>ten handbreadths or <span class="gemarra-regular">below </span>ten handbreadths? <span class="gemarra-regular">The private domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ascends to the sky, </span>and there is no difference whether an object is above or below ten handbreadths.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>say <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">stands in the public domain; </span>but in that case the question arises: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where </span>did the person <span class="gemarra-regular">intend to establish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his Shabbat residence? If you say that </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to</span> establish his <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat residence </span>in the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">above, he and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are in one place. </span>Consequently, the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> should be valid, even if is at a height of more than ten handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>say that he <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to establish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his Shabbat residence </span>on the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">below; </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he making use of the tre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> if he accesses his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? It is prohibited to make use of a tree on Shabbat, and therefore his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> should invalid even if it is less than ten handbreadths above the ground because it is inaccessible to him. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>we can accept the latter assumption <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">stands in the public domain, and that he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">intended to establish his Shabbat residence </span>on the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">below, </span>in the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to the prohibition against making use of a tree, this mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">who said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Anything that is </span>prohibited on Shabbat not by Torah law, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">due to a rabbinic decree [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shevut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">did not issue the decree </span>to apply <span class="gemarra-regular">during twilight</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is neither definitively day nor definitively night. Since using a tree is only prohibited due to a <span class="it-text">shevut</span>, it is permitted to make use of the tree and remove one’s <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> from it during the twilight period, which is when the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> establishes the person’s Shabbat residence. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is valid, provided that it is below ten handbreadths. If, however, the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is above ten handbreadths, it is invalid. At that height, removing the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> from the tree entails violation of the Torah prohibition of carrying from a private domain to a public domain, which is prohibited even during twilight. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said to them: Well </span>said, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Shmuel said similarly </span>with regard to this issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Have you, </span>the Sages of Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">gone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so far in your explanation </span>of the mishna? The Gemara asks: Why were the Sages of Eretz Yisrael so surprised? <span class="gemarra-regular">They, too, explained </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this is what they said to </span>Rav Naḥman: <span class="gemarra-regular">Have you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> established this </span>explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">as part of your </span>regular <span class="gemarra-regular">study </span>of the mishna?<span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: Yes. </span>Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was also </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: Here, we are dealing with a tree standing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain, </span>and the tree is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high and four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide. </span>It thereby constitutes a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to establish his Shabbat residence below </span>in the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">who said: Anything</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is </span>prohibited on Shabbat not by Torah law, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">due to a rabbinic decree, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> issue the decree </span>to apply <span class="gemarra-regular">during twilight.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>in continuation of this discussion: <span class="gemarra-regular">They only taught</span> this law <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a tree that stands beyond</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the outskirts of the city, </span>i.e., outside a radius of seventy and two-thirds cubits around the city. <span class="gemarra-regular">However</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree that stands within the outskirts</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even </span>if the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was placed <span class="gemarra-regular">above ten </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the city is considered as though it were filled in </span>with earth,so that anything located at any height within the town itself or its outskirts is regarded as being in the same domain. Even though the person intended to establish his Shabbat residence below the tree in the public domain, we view the ground as raised to the height of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, and his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is therefore valid even though he cannot actually remove it from the tree during the twilight period.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>if the tree stood <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond the outskirts of the town</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>there should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be no difference whether the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is above or below the height of ten handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since Rava</span> himself <span class="gemarra-regular">said: One who places his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> in a particular location <span class="gemarra-regular">has four cubits </span>surrounding him that are considered as a private domain, here too, the area should be considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a private domain; and a private domain rises to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sky. </span>Since the tree stands within this area, all parts of the tree should be regarded as a private domain regardless of their height.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Mesharshiya, said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Here, we are dealing with a tree that leans out</span> horizontally <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond four cubits </span>from its trunk, and one placed the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> on a section that is beyond four cubits,

Daf 33a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he intended to establish his Shabbat residence at its base</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And what </span>is the meaning of the terms <span class="gemarra-regular">above and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> below, </span>as we said that this tree extends horizontally to the side, which indicates that it remains at a uniform height? After the tree leans horizontally beyond four cubits from the place of its roots, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>rises once <span class="gemarra-regular">again in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an upright </span>position, and therefore the terms above and below are applicable. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>it true that even if the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is above ten handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">if one wants, he can </span>remove it from where it was deposited and <span class="gemarra-regular">bring it by way of </span>the tree’s <span class="gemarra-regular">leaves</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., its branches that are above ten handbreadths, to within four cubits of the place where he intended to establish his Shabbat residence? Therefore, the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> should be valid even though it is above ten handbreadths.
The Gemara answers: We are dealing with a unique situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the horizontal section of the tree is used by <span class="gemarra-regular">the masses </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">shoulder </span>their burdens <span class="gemarra-regular">on it, </span>i.e., to temporarily rest their loads on it, so that they can adjust them and easily lift them up again; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in that case <span class="gemarra-regular">is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla, as Ulla said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pillar </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span>handbreadths high and situated <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the masses </span>use it to <span class="gemarra-regular">shoulder </span>their loads upon it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and someone threw </span>an object from a private domain <span class="gemarra-regular">and it came to rest upon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it, he is liable, </span>as this pillar has the status of a public domain. Consequently, in the case of the tree, one may not bring the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> by way of the tree’s branches, as the horizontal section of the tree has the status of a public domain, and one may not carry from one private domain to another via a public domain. 
The Gemara previously cited the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi that anything that is prohibited on Shabbat due to rabbinic decree is not prohibited during the twilight period. The Gemara now attempts to clarify the matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the source that originally cites <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is </span>the source which cites the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis? </span>
The Gemara cites the source of the disagreement: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If one placed </span>his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in a tree above ten</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handbreadths </span>from the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If he placed it <span class="gemarra-regular">below ten handbreadths, his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but he is prohibited to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> take it </span>on Shabbat in order to eat it because it is prohibited to use the tree on Shabbat. However, if the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">within three </span>handbreadths of the ground,<span class="gemarra-regular">he is permitted to take it </span>because it is considered as though it were on the ground and not in a tree. If <span class="gemarra-regular">one placed </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> basket and hung it on a tree, even above ten</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handbreadths, his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis </span>disagree and <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>situation in which the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was placed in <span class="gemarra-regular">a location where it is prohibited to take </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara clarifies: With regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to which </span>statement did <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis state </span>their opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>they were referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the latter clause </span>with respect to the basket hanging from the tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us say that the Rabbis hold </span>that using even <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sides </span>of a tree <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as making use of the basket is considered using the sides of a tree. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Rabbis’ statement must refer <span class="gemarra-regular">to the first </span><span class="gemarra-regular">clause, </span>in which Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says that if one put the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> below ten handbreadths, his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is valid, but he is prohibited to move it.
The Gemara clarifies further: <span class="gemarra-regular">This tree, what are its circumstances? If it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not four </span>by four handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is an exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> domain, </span>i.e., a neutral place with respect to the laws of carrying on Shabbat, from which an object may be carried into any other Shabbat domain. In that case, the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> should be valid even if it was placed higher than ten handbreadths in the tree. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is four </span>by four handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">when one places it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a basket, what of it? </span>What difference does it make? In any event it is in a private domain. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: The first clause </span>is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">is four </span>by four handbreadths wide. The <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is not valid if it was placed above ten handbreadths because the tree at that height constitutes a private domain, and the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> cannot be brought to the public domain below, where one wishes to establish his Shabbat residence. <span class="gemarra-regular">The latter clause, </span>however, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">is not four </span>by four handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the basket completes </span>the width of the tree at that spot <span class="gemarra-regular">to four. </span>

Daf 33b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, and he </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda.</span>
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">He holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who said </span>the following in the case of an arched gateway in which the lower, straight-walled section is three handbreadths high, and the entire arch is ten handbreadths high: Even if, at the height of ten handbreadths, the arch is less than four handbreadths wide, one considers it as if he <span class="gemarra-regular">carves out </span>the space <span class="gemarra-regular">to complete </span>it, i.e., the arch has the legal status as though it were actually enlarged to a width of four handbreadths.Similarly, in our case the basket is taken into account and enlarges the tree to a width of four handbreadths. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And he </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">We require </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> rest <span class="gemarra-regular">on a place </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>by four handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>a width of four handbreadths without taking the basket into account. 
The Gemara now asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the source of the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda? As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda says: If one stuck a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>into the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain and placed his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it, </span>if the cross beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide, </span>so that it has the status of a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but if not, his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara expresses surprise: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, </span>if the cross beam is not ten handbreadths high, why shouldn’t his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> be valid? <span class="gemarra-regular">He and his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are in the same</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> place, </span>i.e., in the public domain.<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is what he said: </span>If the cross beam is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten</span> handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high, it is necessary that its top be four</span> handbreadths wide, so that it can be considered its own domain; but if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high, it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not necessary that its top be four </span>handbreadths wide because it is considered part of the public domain. 
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion did Ravina offer his explanation, which maintains that we are dealing with a basket that completes the dimension of the tree to four handbreadths and yet it is not treated as a private domain? <span class="gemarra-regular">It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, son of Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one stuck a reed </span>into the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> public domain, and placed a basket [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">teraskal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> four by four handbreadths wide <span class="gemarra-regular">on top of it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and threw</span> an object from the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it landed upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it, he is liable </span>for carrying from a public domain to a private domain. According to Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, if a surface of four by four handbreadths rests at a height of ten handbreadths from the ground, this is sufficient for it to be considered a private domain. Ravina’s explanation of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s position, however, does not appear to accept this assumption. 
The Gemara refutes this and claims that this proof is not conclusive: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even if you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that Ravina’s explanation is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, </span>a distinction can be made: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of the basket resting on a reed, the sides of the basket constitute <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">surround </span>the reed on all sides, and we can invoke the principle of: Lower the partition, according to which the partitions are viewed as extending down to the ground. Consequently, a kind of private domain is created within the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>in the case of the basket hanging from the tree, the <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions </span>of the basket <span class="gemarra-regular">do not surround </span>the tree, and so they do not suffice to create a private domain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya said </span>that the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> can be explained in an entirely different manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">A basket is different, since one can tilt i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>in that way <span class="gemarra-regular">bring it to within ten </span>handbreadths of the ground. Without moving the entire basket, one can tilt it and thereby remove the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in order to eat it, without carrying it from one domain to another.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa sat and recited this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rav bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shabba raised an objection to Rav Pappa </span>from the following mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">What does one do </span>if a Festival occurs on Friday, and he wishes to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> that will be valid for both the Festival and Shabbat? <span class="gemarra-regular">He brings </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> to the location that he wishes to establish as his residence <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the eve of the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>day, i.e., the eve of the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">and stays </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">with it until nightfall, </span>the time when the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> establishes that location as his residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he takes it </span>with him <span class="gemarra-regular">and goes away</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that it does not become lost before Shabbat begins, in which case he would not have an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">On </span>the eve of the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>day, i.e., on Friday afternoon, he takes it back to the same place as the day before, and <span class="gemarra-regular">stays </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">with it until nightfall, </span>thereby establishing his Shabbat residence; and then he may then <span class="gemarra-regular">eat </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and go away, </span>if he so desires. 

Daf 34a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>must one actually bring the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> to the place where he wishes to establish his residence? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say: Since if he wished</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to bring </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> there <span class="gemarra-regular">he could bring it, even</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> though he did not bring it, it is considered as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> though he did bring it </span>there. This follows the same reasoning proposed by Rav Yirmeya in the case of the basket: Since one can tilt it. The fact that this reasoning is not employed here indicates that the potential to do something is insufficient; rather, the deed must actually be done.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: </span>The fact that one must bring his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> the day before to the spot that he wishes to establish as his place of residence, and the potential to bring it there does not suffice, is <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree due to a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that occurs after Shabbat. </span>In that case, the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is valid for the Festival only if it was brought there before Shabbat, for it cannot be carried there on Shabbat. Since one cannot actually bring the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> there, it cannot be said: It is considered as though he did bring it there because had he wished to bring the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> he could have. Consequently, the Sages decreed that in all cases, the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is only valid if it was actually brought to the designated spot, lest one come to think that even on a Festival that occurs after Shabbat it need not be brought there. 
Rav bar Shabba <span class="gemarra-regular">raised </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">objection </span>from a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to establish his Shabbat residence in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the public domain and placed his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a wall</span> that is more than four cubits away from that location; if he placed the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">below </span>a height of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handbreadths </span>above the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>but if he placed it <span class="gemarra-regular">above ten handbreadths, his</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> because he is in a public domain while his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is in a private domain. If <span class="gemarra-regular">one intended to establish his Shabbat residence on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> top of a dovecote or on top of </span>a large <span class="gemarra-regular">cupboard, </span>if he placed the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in the dovecote or cupboard <span class="gemarra-regular">above ten handbreadths </span>from the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> because both he and his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> are in a private domain; but if he placed it <span class="gemarra-regular">below ten handbreadths, </span>the area in which he placed his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is considered a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, and <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> because he cannot transport his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> from there to his own domain on Shabbat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>should this be so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, let us </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> should be valid even if it was placed below ten handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">since one can tilt </span>the cupboard <span class="gemarra-regular">and bring it to within ten </span>handbreadths from the ground, in which case he and his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> would be in the same domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya said: Here, we are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dealing with a cupboard that is nailed </span>to the wall so that it cannot be tilted. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Even if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a cupboard that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not nailed </span>to the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, we are dealing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>a very <span class="gemarra-regular">tall cupboard, </span>such <span class="gemarra-regular">that were one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to tilt it a little </span>in order to bring the top of the cupboard within ten handbreadths from the ground, the top of the cupboard <span class="gemarra-regular">would project beyond </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> four </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits </span>that constitute one’s Shabbat residence.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span>exactly, <span class="gemarra-regular">are the circumstances? If </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the cupboard <span class="gemarra-regular">has a window, and </span>one has <span class="gemarra-regular">a rope </span>at hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him bring it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by means of the window and rope. </span>In other words, let him lower the rope through the cupboard’s window and bring the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with it, and he will not have to move the entire cupboard. The Gemara answers: Here we are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have a window, and </span>he does not have <span class="gemarra-regular">a rope </span>at hand.
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If one placed</span> the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in a pit, even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hundred cubits deep, </span>his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is a valid <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This pit, where is it situated? If you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say that it is situated in the private domain, </span>

Daf 34b

<span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">obvious, </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the private domain ascends to the sky, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">just as it ascends upward, so </span>too, <span class="gemarra-regular">it descends downward </span>to the bottom of the pit, even if it is more than ten handbreadths deep. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>we must say <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">is situated in the public domain.</span>
The Gemara now clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where </span>did one <span class="gemarra-regular">intend to establish his Shabbat residence? If </span>he intended to establish his residence <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>the pit in the public domain, this is a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he is in one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> place and his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in another place, </span>i.e., in a private domain, and therefore his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is not valid. Alternatively, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>one intended to establish his Shabbat residence <span class="gemarra-regular">below, </span>in the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are in one place. </span>
The Gemara answers: This ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">is situated in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and he intended to establish his Shabbat residence above </span>the pit in the <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to the question of how this <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> can be valid, as one cannot bring the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> from the pit to the <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, the answer is that the mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">who said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anything that is </span>prohibited on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rabbinic decree [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shevut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], they did not issue the decree </span>to apply <span class="gemarra-regular">during twilight. </span>Since carrying from the pit to the <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> is only prohibited as a <span class="it-text">shevut</span>, a person may carry from the pit to the <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> during twilight, the time when the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> establishes one’s Shabbat residence.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">one placed</span> his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on top of a ree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">top of a pole [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kundas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], when </span>the reed or pole <span class="gemarra-regular">is detached </span>from its original place <span class="gemarra-regular">and stuck </span>into the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a hundred cubits high</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as one can remove the reed or pole from the ground and take his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Mattana raised a contradiction before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rava </span>concerning two tannaitic rulings: The mishna states that if the reed <span class="gemarra-regular">was detached </span>from its place of growth <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">stuck </span>into the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is valid. That indicates that if it <span class="gemarra-regular">was not detached and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">stuck </span>back into the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is not valid. In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is this mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: Anything that is </span>prohibited on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">due to rabbinic</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> decree [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shevut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>such as using a tree on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> issued the decree </span>to apply even <span class="gemarra-regular">during twilight. </span>Therefore, if the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was on top of a reed that was still attached to the ground in its original place of growth, since it is prohibited by rabbinic decree to make use of trees on Shabbat, one cannot remove the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> from its place at the time that he must establish his Shabbat residence, and therefore his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is invalid. But <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause, </span>i.e., the previous mishna, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi? How can you say that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first clause </span>is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">and the latter clause </span>is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis?</span>
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Adda: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥama already raised this contradiction before Rav Ḥisda, and </span>Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">answered him: </span>Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the latter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">clause </span>is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>You can, in fact, say that <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is all Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the latter clause, </span>i.e., the mishna that insists that the reed be detached and inserted, is not based upon the prohibition of utilizing trees on Shabbat. Rather, in that case there is a unique <span class="gemarra-regular">decree lest he break </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> from the ground if the reed is relatively soft. Therefore, the mishna requires one to use something that has already been detached from the ground and reinserted. However, the previous mishna is referring to someone who placed his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in a tree, where this concern is not relevant. 
The Gemara relates <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a certain <span class="gemarra-regular">army</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pulmosa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> once <span class="gemarra-regular">came to Neharde’a </span>and took quarters in the study hall, so that there was not enough room for the students. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said to </span>the students: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go out and create </span>seats by <span class="gemarra-regular">compressing </span>reeds <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the marshes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and tomorrow, </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">we will go </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and sit on them </span>and study there. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama raised an objection to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Naḥman, and some say </span>that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ukva</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Abba </span>who raised the objection <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Naḥman, </span>from the mishna that states that if the reed <span class="gemarra-regular">was detached</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">stuck </span>into the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes; </span>but if it <span class="gemarra-regular">was not detached and not stuck </span>into the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This shows that it is not enough to compress the reeds, and they must actually be detached from the ground before they may be used on Shabbat.
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: There, </span>in the mishna, we are dealing with <span class="gemarra-regular">hard</span> reeds, which may not be bent and used on Shabbat, unlike soft reeds.He adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where do you say that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we distinguish between hard </span>reeds <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>reeds <span class="gemarra-regular">that are not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hard? As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Reeds, boxthorn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and thistle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are species of trees, and </span>therefore they <span class="gemarra-regular">are not </span>included in the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">food crops </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in a vineyard, </span>which applies only to herbs planted among vines. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it was taught in another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Reeds, cassia</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and bulrushes are species of herbs, and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">they are</span> included in the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">food crops in a vineyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>These two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">contradict one another, </span>as one states that reeds are trees, while the other says that they are considered herbs.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, conclude from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>that we must distinguish between them as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>in the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to hard </span>reeds, which are like trees; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>reeds <span class="gemarra-regular">that are not hard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from this </span>that our resolution of the contradiction is correct. 
The Gemara raises a question with regard to the previously cited <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is cassia a type of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> herb? Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not graft ru</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to white cassia, as this </span>involves the grafting of <span class="gemarra-regular">herbs to a tree? </span>This proves that white cassia is a tree. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>There is no difficulty, as <span class="gemarra-regular">cassia is distinct </span>and is considered a type of herb, <span class="gemarra-regular">and white cassia is distinct </span>and is considered a type of tree. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">If one put </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in a cupboard </span>and locked it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the key </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was lost, </span>so that he is now unable to open the cupboard and access the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>nonetheless a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rabbi Eliezer says: If he does not know</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that the key is in its place, it is not</span> a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why </span>should the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> be valid if the key was lost? <span class="gemarra-regular">He is in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one place and his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in a different place, </span>since he cannot access the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was Rav and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel who both said: Here, we are dealing with a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cupboard </span>made <span class="gemarra-regular">of bricks</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who said: One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may create a breach </span>in a brick wall on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and take </span>produce from the other side. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a house filled with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">produce </span>had been <span class="gemarra-regular">sealed and was </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">breached, one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> take out </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">from the place of the breach</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: One may </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">create a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> breach </span>in the wall of the house <span class="gemarra-regular">and take </span>produce <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Consequently, according to Rabbi Meir it is permissible to make a hole in the cupboard in order to remove the produce found inside. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman bar Adda say that Shmuel said </span>that that very mishna cited as a proof is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a structure built from <span class="gemarra-regular">layers of bricks </span>piled one atop the other without cement or mortar between them, in which case making a hole cannot be considered dismantling a bona fide structure? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>we are dealing with a cupboard made from <span class="gemarra-regular">layers of bricks.</span>
The Gemara raises another difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rabbi Zeira say: </span>The Sages in the aforementioned mishna, who discussed the breaching of a wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">spoke </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a Festival, but not with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to Shabbat? </span>Therefore, it cannot be derived from that mishna that it is permitted to breach the cupboard on Shabbat in order to access the food inside. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case where the person needed an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival </span>but not for Shabbat. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>that the mishna is referring only to a Festival, there is a difficulty with <span class="gemarra-regular">that which was taught about it </span>in the following <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: If </span>the key <span class="gemarra-regular">was lost in a city, his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and if it was lost in a field, his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>for within a city it is possible to carry the key by way of courtyards that have joined together in an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> or the like, but in a field it is impossible to carry it, as the field has the status of a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a Festival, what </span>is the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>whether the key was lost in a <span class="gemarra-regular">city </span>or a <span class="gemarra-regular">field? </span>On a Festival there is no prohibition against carrying from a private to a public domain, and therefore if the key was lost even in a field, the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> should still be valid. 

Daf 35a

The Gemara answers: The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and it teaches the following: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one placed </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in a cupboard and locked it, and the key is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lost</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is </span>nonetheless a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. In what</span> case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? On a Festival; however, on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shabbat, his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> key is found</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whether in a city or in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a field, his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eliezer </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>If it is found <span class="gemarra-regular">in a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> city, his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>but if it is found <span class="gemarra-regular">in a field, his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara now explains the difference: If the key is found <span class="gemarra-regular">in a city, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, who said: Roofs, courtyards, and enclosed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fields [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpeifot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] are all one domain </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to utensils </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that began Shabbat in them. </span>Accordingly, a utensil that was left on a roof at the beginning of Shabbat may be carried into a courtyard or a <span class="it-text">karpef</span>. It is possible to transfer anything located in a city from one place to another in a similar manner. If, however, the key is found <span class="gemarra-regular">in a field, his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> due to the prohibition to carry in a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>. Although carrying there is merely a <span class="it-text">shevut</span>, the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is not valid.
The discussion above constitutes one understanding of the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba and Rav Yosef, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">both said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Here, we are dealing with a wooden cupboard, </span>and the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> disagree with regard to the following point: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>first, anonymous <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>who rules that the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is valid, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the cupboard <span class="gemarra-regular">is a utensil, and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is no </span>prohibited labor of <span class="gemarra-regular">building utensils, and </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is no dismantling of utensils. </span>Since dismantling a utensil is not included in the prohibited labor of dismantling, one may make a hole in the cupboard in order to access the food used for the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>Rabbi Eliezer, who invalidates the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the cupboard <span class="gemarra-regular">is a tent. </span>A wooden implement of such a large size is no longer classified as a utensil; rather, it is considered a building, and therefore it is subject to the prohibitions against building and dismantling on Shabbat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>their dispute is parallel to <span class="gemarra-regular">the dispute between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as we learned </span>in a mishna with regard to the ritual impurity of a <span class="it-text">zav</span>: One of the unique laws of a <span class="it-text">zav</span> is that he imparts impurity to an object simply by moving it, even if he does not touch it directly. If a <span class="it-text">zav</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">knocked</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on a carriage, crate, or cupboard, </span>even if he did not actually come into direct contact with them, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>nonetheless ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure </span>because he caused them to move when he struck them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Shimon </span>disagree and <span class="gemarra-regular">render </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">pure.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What, are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they not disagreeing about this </span>point: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage holds </span>that a carriage, crate, or cupboard <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>categorized as <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">utensil, </span>and therefore it contracts ritual impurity when a <span class="it-text">zav</span> causes it to move; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a tent, </span>and a building does not contract ritual impurity in any way from a <span class="it-text">zav</span>? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>in refutation of this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">you think </span>that this is a reasonable explanation of the mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If a <span class="it-text">zav</span> shook a real <span class="gemarra-regular">tent, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and it moved, it is </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure; </span>and if he shook <span class="gemarra-regular">a utensil and it did not move, it is</span> ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">pure? </span>This indicates that the critical factor is not whether the article is classified as a tent or as a utensil but whether or not it actually moves when shaken. Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught in the latter clause </span>of that <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if they moved, they are </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the principle: </span>If a utensil or a tent <span class="gemarra-regular">moved due to the </span>direct <span class="gemarra-regular">force </span>of the <span class="it-text">zav</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure. </span>But if it moved <span class="gemarra-regular">due to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> vibrations</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> e.g., if the <span class="it-text">zav</span> knocked on the floor or on the platform upon which the object is located, and the vibrations of the floor or the platform caused the object to move, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">pure, </span>as it was not moved by the direct force of the <span class="it-text">zav</span>. Once again, the determining factor is not the object’s classification as a tent or a utensil but whether it was actually moved by the <span class="it-text">zav</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Abaye said </span>that the dispute between the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> and Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Shimon should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">All </span>agree that <span class="gemarra-regular">movement</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> due to </span>the direct <span class="gemarra-regular">force </span>of the <span class="it-text">zav</span> causes the object to become ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure, </span>whether it is a tent or a utensil. Conversely, if the movement was <span class="gemarra-regular">due to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> vibrations </span>of the floor or base, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">pure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And here, we are dealing with </span>a case where the object <span class="gemarra-regular">vibrated because of </span>the direct <span class="gemarra-regular">force </span>of the <span class="it-text">zav</span>, i.e., where he banged upon the object itself, causing it to vibrate but not to move. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span><span class="it-text">’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to the following </span>point: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage holds </span>that this, too, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">movement; and the</span> other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that vibration <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">movement. </span>Therefore, Abaye rejects Rabba and Rav Yosef’s proof for their explanation of the mishna. 
The Gemara therefore proceeds to ask: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">how is the mishna </span>with regard to <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to be interpreted? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rava both said: We are dealing </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">with a lock</span> that is <span class="gemarra-regular">tied with a leather strap</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> knife is required to cut i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> if there is no key. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>anonymous <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, who said: All utensils may be moved on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, except for a large saw and the blade of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a plow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Consequently, one may take a knife, cut the strap, and remove his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> from the cupboard. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Neḥemya, who said: Even a cloak, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">even a spoon, </span>which are certainly used only for activities permitted on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">may be moved </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">only for the purpose of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">use. </span>The same applies to a knife, which may be moved only in order to cut food, but not for any other purpose. Consequently, one cannot cut the strap around the lock of the cupboard, and therefore his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is invalid unless the key is located in town and he can transport it via courtyards. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one’s <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">rolled beyond the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and he no longer has access to his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> since he may not go beyond his limit, or if <span class="gemarra-regular">a pile </span>of stones <span class="gemarra-regular">fell on it, or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it was burnt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or if the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and it became </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure; </span>if any of these occurrences took place <span class="gemarra-regular">while </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was still day, </span>prior to the onset of Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>since one did not have an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> at twilight, which is the time one’s Shabbat residence is established. However, if any of these occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">after dark, </span>when it was already Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span> a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as it was intact and accessible at the time one’s Shabbat residence is determined. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the matter is <span class="gemarra-regular">in doubt, </span>i.e., if he does not know when one of the aforementioned incidents occurred, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda say: This </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in the position of both <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey driver, </span>who must prod the animal from behind, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a camel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">driver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who must lead the animal from the front, i.e., he is a person who is pulled in two opposite directions. Due to the uncertainty concerning his Shabbat border, he must act stringently, as though his resting place were both in his town and at the location where he placed the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. He must restrict his Shabbat movement to those areas that are within two thousand cubits of both locations.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon </span>disagree and <span class="gemarra-regular">say:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> An </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> whose validity is <span class="gemarra-regular">in doubt is </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">valid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rav Yosei said: </span>The Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">Avtolemo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> testified in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">name of five Elders that an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> whose validity is <span class="gemarra-regular">in doubt is valid.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna: If one’s <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">rolled beyond the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit </span>prior to the onset of Shabbat, it is not a valid <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: They only taught </span>this in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one established his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> at the edge of his town’s Shabbat limit and the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">rolled more than four cubits </span>outside that limit; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, </span>if it remained <span class="gemarra-regular">within four cubits </span>of the Shabbat limit, it is a valid <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. The principle is that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who places his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> in a particular location <span class="gemarra-regular">has four cubits </span>around it, since he has established his Shabbat residence there. 
The mishna continues: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a pile </span>of stones <span class="gemarra-regular">fell on </span>the <span class="it-text">eiru</span><span class="it-text">v</span> prior to the onset of Shabbat, it is not a valid <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span>might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind </span>to say that the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if one wanted he could take </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, i.e., where it is physically possible to clear the stones and remove the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> from underneath them. The only reason he cannot do so is because of the rabbinic prohibition to handle items that are set-aside, such as stones, on Shabbat.
If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us say that the mishna is not in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if </span>you say that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, there is a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anything prohibited due to rabbinic </span><span class="gemarra-regular">decree, they did not issue the decree to apply during </span><span class="gemarra-regular">twilight? </span>The prohibition to handle items that are set-aside is also a rabbinic decree, and therefore, according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, since the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was accessible at twilight, it should be valid. 
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even if you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, we can say that this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">was necessary only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where a hoe or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a spade would be required </span>in order to remove the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> from under the stones, i.e., one would have to dig, which is a Shabbat labor prohibited by Torah law, not only by rabbinic decree.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>both rulings, the ruling concerning an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> that rolled beyond the Shabbat limit and the ruling concerning an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> that became buried under a pile of rocks, <span class="gemarra-regular">are necessary. As, if </span>the mishna had only <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the case of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">rolled </span>away, we might have said that the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is invalid <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is not near him, but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">a pile </span>of rocks <span class="gemarra-regular">fell on </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, since <span class="gemarra-regular">it is near him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>you might <span class="gemarra-regular">say that it should be </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as one does not actually have to eat the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the mishna had only <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">a pile </span>of rocks <span class="gemarra-regular">fell on </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, we might have said that the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is invalid <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is covered, but </span>in the case where it <span class="gemarra-regular">rolled </span>away, since <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes a wind comes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and brings it </span>back, <span class="gemarra-regular">you might say that it should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be a </span>valid <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. Therefore, it was necessary to teach both cases.
The mishna further states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>if the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was burnt, </span>or if the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that became </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure </span>before Shabbat, it is not a valid <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I need </span>to teach these two cases? The essential point of both cases is the same: The <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is no longer fit to be eaten. The Gemara answers: The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the case where the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">burnt</span>

Daf 35b

<span class="gemarra-regular">to convey the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> far-reaching nature of Rabbi Yosei’s </span>statement, as he is lenient in a case of uncertainty whether the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was burnt the previous day or only after nightfall, even though the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is now entirely destroyed. Additionally, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that became </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to convey the far-reaching nature of Rabbi Meir’s </span>statement, as he is stringent even though the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> itself is still present, and there is only an uncertainty about when it became impure.
The Gemara questions the mishna’s ruling itself: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does Rabbi Meir </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">hold </span>that in cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">doubt</span> one must be <span class="gemarra-regular">stringent? Didn’t we learn </span>the following in a mishna: If a ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">descended to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> immerse </span>in a ritual bath, and there is <span class="gemarra-regular">doubt</span> whether he actually <span class="gemarra-regular">immerse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or he did not immerse; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and even if he </span>certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">immersed, </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">doubt </span>whether he <span class="gemarra-regular">immersed in </span>a ritual bath containing <span class="gemarra-regular">forty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of water, the minimal amount of water necessary for the ritual bath to be valid, <span class="gemarra-regular">or he did not immerse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in forty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and similarly, </span>if there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span> adjacent <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual baths, one </span>of which <span class="gemarra-regular">has forty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> of water <span class="gemarra-regular">in it </span>and is therefore valid, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of which <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have forty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of water <span class="gemarra-regular">in it, and he immersed in one of them, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but he does not know in which of them he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">immersed; </span>in each of these cases, owing to <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> doubt, he </span>remains ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">In what case is this statement, </span>which maintains that in cases of doubt one is considered impure, <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to severe </span>forms of ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity, </span>i.e., those imparted by a primary source of ritual impurity. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, with regard to lenient </span>forms of ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity </span>imposed only by rabbinic decree, <span class="gemarra-regular">such as one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who ate </span>half a half-loaf of <span class="gemarra-regular">impure foods; and</span> similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who drank impure liquids; and one whose </span><span class="gemarra-regular">head and most of his body came under drawn water,</span> as opposed to spring water or rainwater, in which case the Sages decreed that person to be ritually impure; <span class="gemarra-regular">or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if three </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of drawn water fell on one’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> head and most of his body, </span>in which case the Sages also decreed that person to be impure; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>if in any of these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">one descended to immerse </span>himself in a ritual bath to purify himself of the rabbinically decreed impurity, and there is <span class="gemarra-regular">doubt </span>whether he actually <span class="gemarra-regular">immersed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or he did not immerse; and even if he </span>certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">immersed, </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">doubt </span>whether he <span class="gemarra-regular">immersed in forty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’a</span> of water <span class="gemarra-regular">or he did not immerse in forty</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and similarly, </span>if there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two ritual baths</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, one </span>of which <span class="gemarra-regular">has forty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of water <span class="gemarra-regular">in it and one </span>of which <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have forty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of water <span class="gemarra-regular">in it, and he immersed in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one of them, but he does not know in which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of them he immersed; </span>in all of these cases, owing to <span class="gemarra-regular">his doubt, he is </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">pure. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">renders him </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure. </span>In any event, it is clear that, according to the unattributed mishna, which is generally presumed to reflect the opinion of Rabbi Meir, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is lenient in cases of doubt relating to ritual impurity that is due to rabbinic decree. Why, then, doesn’t Rabbi Meir agree that we should be lenient in cases of doubt relating to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, which is also of rabbinic origin?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that the prohibitions relating to Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits are </span>prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law, </span>and therefore the uncertainties in the mishna involve a Torah prohibition, with regard to which one may not be lenient. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Meir </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">hold </span>that the prohibitions of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits are </span>prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law? Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna: When taking measurements related to Shabbat boundaries, if a fifty-cubit rope is held at either end by two people, the distance between them is deemed to be fifty cubits, even if the distance on the ground is greater, owing to inclines and depressions? If there is a hill or incline between them that <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot be swallowed </span>by the fifty-cubit measuring rope, so that the usual mode of measurement cannot be used, <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>situation, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dostai said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the name of Rabbi Meir: I heard that we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pierce mountains</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., we measure the distance as if there were a hole from one side of the hill to the other, so that in effect we measure only the horizontal distance and ignore the differences in elevation. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it should enter your mind</span> to say that the prohibitions relating to Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits are</span> prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law, would </span>it be permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">pierce</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the mountains? Didn’t Rav Naḥman say that Rabba bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Avuh said: We may not pierce </span>mountains <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>measuring the boundaries of <span class="gemarra-regular">cities of refuge nor </span>when measuring which city is closest to a corpse and is therefore obligated to perform the rite of the <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer whose neck is broken</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, because those </span>laws <span class="gemarra-regular">are from the Torah; </span>therefore, a more stringent policy is used to measure the distances precisely? 
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as there is no contradiction between the two statements. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>statement, according to which Shabbat limits are by Torah law, <span class="gemarra-regular">is his; that </span>statement, in which he is lenient, <span class="gemarra-regular">is his teacher’s. </span>The language of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise </span>according to this explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned: In this </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dostai bar Yannai</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said in the name of Rabbi Meir: I have heard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that we pierce mountains. </span>This formulation indicates that Rabbi Meir did not state his own opinion. Rather, he transmitted a ruling that he had heard from his teacher, even though he did not agree with it himself. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from this </span>that this resolution is correct. 
The Gemara continues: There is still room <span class="gemarra-regular">to raise a contradiction </span>between one ruling with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah law and </span>another ruling with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah </span><span class="gemarra-regular">law, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">touched one</span> other person <span class="gemarra-regular">at night, and he does not know whether</span> the person he touched was <span class="gemarra-regular">alive or dead</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the following day he arose and found him dead, </span>and he is in doubt as to whether or not he contracted ritual impurity as a result of having come into contact with a corpse, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir renders him </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">pure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>It is assumed that the deceased was still alive until the point that it is known with certainty that he is dead. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis render him </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure because</span> it is assumed that <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure </span>items had already been in the same state as they were <span class="gemarra-regular">at the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> time they were discovered. </span>Just as the deceased was found dead in the morning, so too, it may be presumed that he was dead when he was touched in the middle of the night. Therefore, Rabbi Meir is lenient even with respect to an uncertainty relating to a Torah law, and he holds that a person is presumed to be alive until it is known with certainty that he died. Why, then, is he stringent concerning doubt as to whether the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> had already become impure on the previous day or only after nightfall? Here too, one should assume that the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is ritually pure until he knows with certainty that it became defiled, and so the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> should be valid, even if Shabbat limits are considered Torah law. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya said: The mishna </span>is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where a creeping animal </span>that imparts ritual impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">was on </span>the <span class="it-text">terum</span><span class="it-text">a</span> that was used to establish the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for the entire twilight </span>period. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, in that case, would Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosei say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> whose validity is <span class="gemarra-regular">in doubt </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is valid? </span>There is no uncertainty in this case. 
It was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba and Rav Yosef who both said: </span>The doubt here does not result from the facts of the case themselves, but from conflicting testimonies and an inability to decide between them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, we are dealing with two sets of witnesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>of which <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">became impure while </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was still day, </span>before the onset of Shabbat; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of which <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The <span class="it-text">teruma</span> became impure only <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nightfall. </span>

Daf 36a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>That is not the way to resolve the apparent contradiction between the two rulings; rather, there is a difference between the cases with regard to the ritual impurity itself: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>with regard to touching a person who was later found dead, there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two presumptions </span>supporting <span class="gemarra-regular">leniency, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with respect to the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> being used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, there is only <span class="gemarra-regular">one presumption </span>supporting <span class="gemarra-regular">leniency. </span>How so? With regard to one who touched another person who was later found to be dead, there are two presumptions of purity: Firstly, the person who was found dead was previously alive, and the presumption is that he remained in that state until we know with certainty that he was dead. Secondly, the one who touched that person was previously pure, and he remains in that presumptive state until we know with certainty that he became impure. Therefore, Rabbi Meir had adequate reason to be lenient. However, with regard to <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, only one presumption exists, that the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> was previously pure and presumably remained in that state until proven otherwise. Since there is no additional presumption, Rabbi Meir ruled stringently. 
All the difficulties raised above are based on the seemingly conflicting statements of Rabbi Meir. Yet it would appear that there is also <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contradiction between </span>one statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei and </span>another statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>for he was stringent with regard to the doubts involving ritual baths but lenient with regard to doubts involving <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The law with regard to ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity is different, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">since it has a basis in the Torah. </span>Therefore, Rabbi Yosei was stringent even with respect to immersion performed in order to remove impurity that is only of rabbinic origin. The Gemara asks: The prohibitions of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>limits <span class="gemarra-regular">are also </span>prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law; </span>why isn’t Rabbi Yosei stringent about them as well? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei holds: </span>The laws of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits </span>are by <span class="gemarra-regular">rabbinic </span>law, not by Torah law.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>stringent ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is his; that </span>lenient ruling with regard to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is his teacher’s. </span>The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise </span>according to this explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we learned </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said: </span>The Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">Avtolemos testified in the name of five Elders that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> whose validity is <span class="gemarra-regular">in doubt is valid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This formulation indicates that Rabbi Yosei was merely reporting a ruling that he had heard from his teacher, although he may not have accepted it. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from this </span>that this resolution of the contradiction is correct. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that a different resolution of the contradiction may be suggested: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>with regard to ritual baths, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the reason </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s </span>opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Keep the impure </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">in his presumptive state</span> of ritual impurity, <span class="gemarra-regular">and say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not </span>properly <span class="gemarra-regular">immerse </span>himself.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, keep</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the ritual bath in its presumptive state </span>of validity <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say that </span>the ritual bath <span class="gemarra-regular">was not lacking </span>the requisite measure of water. The Gemara answers: We are dealing here with <span class="gemarra-regular">a ritual bath that had not been </span>previously <span class="gemarra-regular">measured </span>to determine whether it contained forty <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, and therefore it had no prior presumption of validity.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what case did Rabbi Yosei say that an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> whose validity is <span class="gemarra-regular">in doubt is </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">valid? </span>For example, if <span class="gemarra-regular">one established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> that had been ritually pure but later became impure, and there is <span class="gemarra-regular">doubt whether</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it became impure while it was still day, </span>before the onset of Shabbat, or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether it became impure </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">after</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nightfall, and similarly, </span>if one made an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>untithed <span class="gemarra-regular">produce </span>that was later tithed and thereby became permissible for eating, and there is <span class="gemarra-regular">doubt whether it was rendered fit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> while it was still day, </span>before the onset of Shabbat, or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether it was rendered fit </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">after nightfall, this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> whose validity is <span class="gemarra-regular">in doubt </span>which Rabbi Yosei said <span class="gemarra-regular">is valid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, if one established</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> about which <span class="gemarra-regular">there was doubt whether</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it was </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">pure or </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure </span>from the outset; <span class="gemarra-regular">and similarly, </span>if one established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with produce </span>about which <span class="gemarra-regular">there was doubt </span>from the outset <span class="gemarra-regular">whether it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">had been </span>tithed and thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered fit </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">had not been </span>tithed and thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered fit, this is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> whose validity is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">doubt </span>that Rabbi Yosei said <span class="gemarra-regular">is valid.</span>
The Gemara raises a question in order to clarify the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>we <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Keep the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its presumptive state </span>of ritual purity, <span class="gemarra-regular">and say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it was </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">pure </span>at the onset of Shabbat, since it had been previously pure and it is not known when it became impure? According to that reasoning, with regard to untithed <span class="gemarra-regular">produce [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tevel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>it should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Keep </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the untithed produce in its presumptive state, </span>as the produce had certainly been untithed originally, <span class="gemarra-regular">and say that it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>tithed and thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered fit </span>prior to the onset of Shabbat. 
Rather, emend the wording of the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not say: </span>There is <span class="gemarra-regular">doubt whether it was rendered fit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day, </span>before the onset of Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say: </span>There is <span class="gemarra-regular">doubt whether </span>regular produce <span class="gemarra-regular">became mixed </span>with untithed produce <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it became mixed </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">after nightfall. </span>In other words, one used regular food to establish his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, but then <span class="it-text">tevel</span> was mixed with that food, prohibiting the entire mixture from being consumed until tithes are separated for the <span class="it-text">tevel</span>. However, there is doubt whether the produce became mixed with the <span class="it-text">tevel</span> while it was still day, in which case the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is invalid, or whether it became mixed only after nightfall, in which case the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is valid. In that case, we say: Keep the produce in its presumptive state and say that it was not mixed with <span class="it-text">tevel</span> during the day, and therefore the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is valid. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak raised </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a dilemma to Rav Huna: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">there were two loaves </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>someone, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>that was ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>that was ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">pure, </span>and he did not know which one was pure; <span class="gemarra-regular">and he said: Establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">teḥumin</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me with the pure </span>loaf, <span class="gemarra-regular">wherever it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., even though I do not know which it is, I wish to establish my Shabbat residence at the location of the pure loaf, and those present placed both loaves in the same place, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is this a valid <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> or not? 
The Gemara clarifies: The question may <span class="gemarra-regular">be asked according to </span>the stringent opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>and it may <span class="gemarra-regular">be asked</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> according to </span>the lenient opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei. </span>The question may <span class="gemarra-regular">be asked according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir</span> in the following manner: Perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir only stated </span>his stringent opinion with regard to a questionable <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">there, where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there is no </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> that is definitely <span class="gemarra-regular">pure </span>present, but only <span class="it-text">teruma</span> whose purity is in doubt. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>definitely <span class="gemarra-regular">is a pure </span>loaf, and therefore even Rabbi Meir may agree to rule leniently. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>it may be argued that <span class="gemarra-regular">even according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosei, he only said </span>that we are lenient with regard to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> whose validity is in doubt in the case dealt with <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>where, <span class="gemarra-regular">if indeed </span>the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pure, he knows </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>is; <span class="gemarra-regular">but here, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not know </span>how to identify <span class="gemarra-regular">it.</span>
Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to both </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, we require </span>that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> consist of <span class="gemarra-regular">a meal that is fit </span>to be eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">while it is still day, </span>prior to the onset of Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">there is none. </span>Due to the uncertainty as to which loaf is pure and which is impure, neither of the two loaves may be eaten, and an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> made with food that may not be eaten while it is still day is not a valid <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma to Rav Naḥman: </span>If one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This loaf </span>shall remain <span class="gemarra-regular">unconsecrated today, and tomorrow </span>it shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Establish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me with this </span>loaf, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Do we say that since the twilight period’s status as part of the previous day or part of the day that follows is questionable, the consecration of the loaf may take effect before the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> establishes one’s Shabbat residence, and since an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> cannot be made with a consecrated object, the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is not valid? Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rava: In that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
Rava then asked about one who made the opposite statement: This loaf shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated today, and tomorrow </span>it shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">unconsecrated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., it shall be redeemed with money that I have in my house, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Establish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me with this </span>loaf, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: His </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not</span> a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Rava asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>between the two cases? If we are lenient with regard to the twilight period, we should be lenient in both cases. 
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rava in jest: <span class="gemarra-regular">After you eat a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of salt over it, </span>and analyze the matter at length, you will be able to understand the difference. The difference is obvious: When one says that <span class="gemarra-regular">today </span>the loaf shall remain <span class="gemarra-regular">unconsecrated, and tomorrow </span>it shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated, </span>we do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>assume <span class="gemarra-regular">out of doubt </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctity has descended upon </span>the loaf. Therefore, the loaf remains in its presumptive state of being unconsecrated during the twilight period, and the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is valid. With regard to the opposite case, however, when one says that <span class="gemarra-regular">today </span>the loaf shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated, and tomorrow </span>it shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">unconsecrated, </span>we do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>assume <span class="gemarra-regular">out of doubt </span>that the loaf’s <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctity has departed from it. </span>The loaf remains in its presumptive state of consecration for the duration of the twilight period, and therefore the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is invalid.
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one filled a flas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was immersed during the day</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tevul</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">yom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>but does not become fully ritually pure until night <span class="gemarra-regular">from a barrel of tithe </span>that was still <span class="gemarra-italic">tevel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>meaning that the produce inside was first tithe from which <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe had not yet been separated, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he said: Let </span>the contents of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>flask <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the tithe </span>for the contents of the barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">when</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> night falls</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his statement takes effect. </span>If he were to say that the designated portion should immediately become <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe, the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe would be defiled by the flask that is still a <span class="it-text">tevul</span> <span class="it-text">yom</span>. Once night falls, however, the flask is absolutely pure, and if the designation of the flask’s contents as <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe takes effect at that time, the produce remains pure. The mishna teaches that <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe can be separated in this manner.
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me with </span>the contents of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>flask, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not said anything, </span>as the contents of the flask are still <span class="it-text">tevel</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: That is to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the end of the day </span>is when <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> acquires </span>one’s Shabbat residence. The critical time with respect to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is the last moment of Shabbat eve, rather than the first moment of Shabbat.

Daf 36b

<span class="gemarra-regular">As, if it should enter your mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> acquires </span>one’s Shabbat residence at <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">beginning of the day </span>of Shabbat, then <span class="gemarra-regular">if he said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me with </span>the produce in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>flask, <span class="gemarra-regular">why hasn’t he said anything? </span>After nightfall, when Shabbat begins, the flask is already pure, and therefore the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe inside it is also pure and is suitable for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>This is no proof; <span class="gemarra-regular">even if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> acquires </span>one’s Shabbat residence at <span class="gemarra-regular">the beginning of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the day </span>of Shabbat, nonetheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">we require a meal that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is fit </span>to be eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">while it is still day, </span>prior to the onset of Shabbat, in order for the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> to be valid, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there is none </span>in this case. While it was still day, it was certainly prohibited to consume the contents of the flask, which were still <span class="it-text">tevel</span>, and therefore it could not be used as an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">make a condition with regard to his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> of Shabbat borders. In other words, he need not decide in advance in which direction his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> should take effect. For example, he may deposit an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> on each of two opposite sides of his town, <span class="gemarra-regular">and say: If gentiles come </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from the east, my </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in the west, </span>so that I can escape in that direction; and if they come <span class="gemarra-regular">from the west, my </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">east. If they come from here and from there, </span>i.e., from both directions, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will go wherever I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wish, </span>and my <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> will retroactively take effect in that direction; and <span class="gemarra-regular">if they do not come </span>at all, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from here nor from there, I will be like </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the inhabitants of my town </span>and give up both <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span> that I deposited, leaving me with two thousand cubits in all directions from the town. 
Similarly, one may say: <span class="gemarra-regular">If a Sage comes from the eas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and he is spending Shabbat beyond the boundaries of my town, <span class="gemarra-regular">my </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in the east, </span>so that I may go out to greet him there; and if he comes <span class="gemarra-regular">from the west, my </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in the west. </span>If one Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">comes from here, and </span>another Sage comes <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, I will go wherever I wish; and </span>if no Sage comes, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither from here nor from there, I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will be like </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the inhabitants of my </span><span class="gemarra-regular">town. Rabbi Yehuda says: If one of </span>the Sages coming from opposite directions <span class="gemarra-regular">was his teacher, he may go </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">to his teacher, </span>as it is assumed that was his original intention. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if they were both his teachers, </span>so that there is no reason to suppose that he preferred one over the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may go wherever he wishes. </span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rabbi Yitzḥak came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">he taught all </span>of the laws in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna in the opposite </span>manner. That is to say, according to him, if the gentiles came from the east, his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> would be to the east, and, conversely, if the Sage came from the east, his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> would be to the west. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult </span>because if this is correct, there is a contradiction <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the ruling concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">gentiles </span>in the mishna and the ruling concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">gentiles</span> in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>similarly there is a contradiction <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the ruling concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a Sage </span>in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the ruling concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a Sage </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara answers: The apparent contradiction <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the ruling concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">gentiles </span>in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the ruling concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">gentiles </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: This </span>case in the mishna is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a tax collector [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">parhagabena</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> from whom one wishes to flee; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the lord of the town</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> with whom he wishes to speak. Therefore, there are times that one wants to go out toward the gentile, while at other times one wants to flee from him.
Similarly, the apparent contradiction <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the ruling concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a Sage </span>in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the ruling concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sage </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: This </span>case in the mishna is referring to a scholar <span class="gemarra-regular">who sits </span>and delivers public Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">lectures, </span>and one wishes to come and learn Torah from him; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who teaches </span>children how to <span class="gemarra-regular">recite </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">Shema</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., one who teaches young children how to pray, of whom he has no need. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that if a scholar came from one direction to deliver a public lecture and the school teacher came from the opposite direction, his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is in the direction of the scholar. 
We learned in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda says: If one of </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>his teacher, he may go only to his teacher, as we can assume that this was his original intention. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what is the reason that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>do not accept this straightforward argument? The Gemara answers: The Rabbis maintain that <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">prefers </span>to meet the Sage who is <span class="gemarra-regular">his colleague rather than </span>the Sage who is <span class="gemarra-regular">his teacher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as sometimes one learns more from his peers than from his teachers.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>This version of <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> be accepted <span class="gemarra-regular">because of what </span>the Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">Ayo taugh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> to the opposite effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Ayo taught </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: A person cannot make conditions about two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">things at once, </span>i.e., he cannot say that if one Sage comes from one direction and another Sage comes from the other direction, he will go wherever he wishes. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>he may say that <span class="gemarra-regular">if a Sage came from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the east, his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in the east, and if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Sage came from the west, his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the west. But </span>he may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>say that if one Sage came <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, and </span>another Sage came <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>he will go wherever he wishes.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about a case in which one stipulated that if Sages came <span class="gemarra-regular">from here and from there </span>he may go to whichever side he chooses, such <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>effective? Apparently, this is due to the principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no retroactive designation, </span>meaning that a doubtful state of affairs cannot be clarified retroactively. However, according to this principle, when one established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">east </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">to the west </span>in order to be able to travel in the direction of one Sage who comes toward the town in a case where one does not know in advance from which direction he will come, we should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>invoke the principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no retroactive </span><span class="gemarra-regular">designation. </span>Therefore, even if one deposited an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> at both ends of his town for the sake of one Sage who might come from either side, he should not be able to rely on what becomes clarified afterward and decide retroactively which <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> he is interested in. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>This is not a true case of retroactive designation, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sage had already come </span>by twilight but the person who established the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> did not yet know which side of the town the Sage had come toward. Therefore, at the time the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> establishes his Shabbat residence it is clear which <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> the person wants, even though he himself will only become aware of that later. 
The Gemara poses a question with regard to Rav’s statement cited above: Why should we reject the mishna because of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">On the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contrary, </span>let us say that the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ayo </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be accepted <span class="gemarra-regular">because of the mishna. </span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It should not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enter your mind </span>to uphold the mishna’s ruling because it contradicts other sources, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we have </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">heard that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehuda does not </span>accept the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">retroactive designation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. As it was taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who buys</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wine from among the Samaritans [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Kutim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>who do not tithe their produce properly, 

Daf 37a

<span class="gemarra-regular">may say: Two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span> of the hundred <span class="it-text">log</span> present here, <span class="gemarra-regular">which I will separate in the future, </span>when I have finished drinking, <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be </span>the great <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> given to a priest; <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span><span class="it-text">log</span> shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">first tithe; </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="it-text">log</span>, which are a tenth of the remaining ninety <span class="it-text">log</span>, shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">second tithe. He </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">redeems </span>the second-tithe with money because in its sanctified state second tithe may only be consumed in Jerusalem, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he may </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately drin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> the wine, and the wine remaining at the end will be <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes.One may rely on the principle of retroactive designation and say that when he is finished drinking, the wine that is left becomes retroactively designated as <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes, such that the wine he drank was permitted for consumption. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> statement of Rabbi Meir. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Yosei, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Shimon prohibit </span>drinking the wine in this manner. Therefore, it would appear that Rabbi Yehuda rejects the principle of retroactive designation, contrary to the ruling of the mishna and in accordance with the opinion of Ayo. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla </span>also took note of this contradiction between the statements of Rabbi Yehuda, but he <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>the opposite: The statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ayo </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be accepted <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it contradicts what is stated in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna. </span>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But that which was taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Yosei, and Rabbi Shimon prohibit</span> drinking the wine in this manner, indicates, as was demonstrated above, that Rabbi Yehuda rejects the principle of retroactive designation.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>the names of the authorities mentioned in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> dealing with wine <span class="gemarra-regular">in pairs, </span>as follows: The allowance mentioned in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> is according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon prohibit </span>drinking the wine in this manner. Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda agrees with Rabbi Meir and accepts the principle of retroactive designation, in accordance with the mishna. 
To this point, it has been accepted that Rabbi Yosei clearly prohibits the procedure described in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>. Therefore, he apparently rejects the principle of retroactive designation. With regard to this point, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does Rabbi Yosei </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">hold that there is no retroactive</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> designation? Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna elsewhere that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">two women took their birds’ nests</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> pairs of turtledoves or pigeons as purification offerings following childbirth, <span class="gemarra-regular">jointly </span>and without specifying which pair of birds was for which woman, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they gave their birds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’ nests to a priest </span>but did not inform him which birds were consecrated as sin-offerings and which as burnt-offerings, <span class="gemarra-regular">whichever the priest wishes he may offer as a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> burnt-offering, and whichever he wishes he may offer as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a sin-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, Rabbi Yosei must accept the principle of retroactive designation, such that when the priest offers any of the birds as a sacrifice, it is retroactively clarified that the bird had been selected for that woman and as that sacrifice.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>There is no proof from there, with regard to retroactive designation, as the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>deals with a special case, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the women <span class="gemarra-regular">stipulate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> from the outset that the priest would decide which bird would be offered for which woman and as what sacrifice. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so, what </span>need was there for the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">to say</span> anything? If they made an explicit stipulation to that effect, then the priest certainly has the power to fulfill their condition. The Gemara answers: The mishna nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the law is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥisda, as Rav Ḥisda said: Birds’ nests become designated </span>as burnt-offerings or sin-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">only</span>

Daf 37b

<span class="gemarra-regular">when they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are purchased by their owner, </span>if the owner explicitly consecrated it as a burnt-offering or sin-offering when he purchased it, <span class="gemarra-regular">or through the actions of the priest </span>when he offers the birds as sacrifices. Therefore, even if the women did not verbalize their intentions, it is considered as if they had made a stipulation from the outset. Therefore, this case is not an instance of retroactive designation. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And still </span>the question may be raised: Does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no retroactive</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> designation? Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">am</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha’aretz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who is not known to be scrupulous in separating tithes, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one known to be meticulous in his observance of <span class="it-text">halakha</span> and especially the laws of <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes, before the <span class="it-text">ḥaver</span> went to the market to buy himself vegetables from another <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Buy for me </span>as well <span class="gemarra-regular">a bundle </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of vegetables or a cake [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">geluska</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>the <span class="it-text">ḥaver</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not need to tithe </span>the food that he gives to the <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span>. The only reason the food needs to be tithed is because it is <span class="it-text">demai</span>, and an <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span> is not particular about that issue. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yosei. </span>It can be deduced from this ruling that Rabbi Yosei accepts the principle of retroactive designation, as the <span class="it-text">ḥaver</span> purchased bundles of vegetables without specifying which was for himself and which was for the <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span>, and when he gave one to the <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span>, it became retroactively clear that he had purchased that bundle for the <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span> from the start, and therefore he does not need to separate tithes from it as <span class="it-text">demai</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He must tithe </span>it. Since we do not accept the principle of retroactive designation, everything that the <span class="it-text">ḥaver</span> bought was bought for himself, and the fact that he later gave part of it to the <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span> does not exempt him from his original obligation to separate tithes from the <span class="it-text">demai</span>. In any case, it seems that Rabbi Yosei’s opinion in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> contradicts his opinion in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> cited above with regard to wine. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Reverse </span>the opinons in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and say that according to Rabbi Yosei he must tithe the produce he gives to the <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span>, while the Rabbis permit him to proceed without tithing.
The Gemara attempts to bring another proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a different <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: </span>The second <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I have in my house shall be redeemed upon the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span> coin <span class="gemarra-regular">that will </span>happen to <span class="gemarra-regular">come up in my </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hand </span>when I remove it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the pouch</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he did not have a particular coin in mind, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span>The second tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">is redeemed. </span>When the coin is removed from the pouch, it is retroactively clarified that this is the coin that he had in his mind from the outset. This indicates that Rabbi Yosei accepts the principle of retroactive designation.
The Gemara answers again: <span class="gemarra-regular">Reverse </span>the attributions, and <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: He has not redeemed</span> the second tithe. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did you see that you reversed two </span>sources <span class="gemarra-regular">because of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one, </span>and made the two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> conform to the mishna, which indicates that Rabbi Yosei holds that there is no retroactive designation? Perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">I should reverse one </span>source, i.e., the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">because of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="it-text">baraitot</span> and say that in fact Rabbi Yosei accepts the principle of retroactive designation, and it is the lone source that indicates otherwise that must be revised. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> was <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught in reverse, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause states: And Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosei concedes with regard to one who says: The </span>second <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe that I have in my house shall be redeemed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with the new </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span> coin <span class="gemarra-regular">that will </span>happen to <span class="gemarra-regular">come</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> up in my hand </span>when I remove it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pouch, that he has redeemed </span>the second tithe. The Gemara makes the following inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here that he has redeemed </span>the second tithe, it can be proven <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that there, </span>in the first clause of the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not redeem </span>the second tithe. Therefore, the wording found in the earlier part of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is clearly incorrect and must be reversed. 
The Gemara raises a question with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> cited in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">This new </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its circumstances? If </span>it is referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there are two </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>coins in his pouch, so that it is not clear which coin he is referring to, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there is </span>the possibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">retroactive designation, this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>exactly the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>case. Why does he rule here, as opposed to the earlier case, that there is retroactive designation? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must refer to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where he has only one </span>coin in his pouch. But if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the meaning of the expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">Will </span>happen to <span class="gemarra-regular">come up? </span>
The Gemara answers: In fact, it is referring to a case where one has only one coin in his pouch, and the wording of the latter clause is imprecise. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since the first clause taught </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> using this expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">Will </span>happen to <span class="gemarra-regular">come up, the latter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">clause also taught </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> using this same expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">Will </span>happen to <span class="gemarra-regular">come up, </span>even though he was referring to the only new coin that he has in his pouch.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rav Naḥman: Who is this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">does not accept </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">retroactive designation </span><span class="gemarra-regular">even concerning rabbinic decrees? As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one person <span class="gemarra-regular">said to five </span>people: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hereby establishing an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for whichever one of you I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will choose, </span>so that the person <span class="gemarra-regular">I have chosen will </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">walk </span>two thousand cubits from the spot of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, whereas whomever <span class="gemarra-regular">I have not chosen will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">walk </span>two thousand cubits from the location of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, the following distinction applies: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">chose </span>the person for whom he was making the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> before Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day, his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>but if he only chose him <span class="gemarra-regular">after</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nightfall, his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> apparently rejects the principle of retroactive designation, even with regard to rabbinic enactments, as if that were not the case, the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> should be valid even if he only chose the person for whom he was making the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> after nightfall.
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">silent and did not say anything to </span>Rava. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is the opinion of a Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">of the school </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Ayo, </span>in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, which maintains that even with regard to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> there is no retroactive designation. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accept </span>Ayo’s version of Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion and considered it incorrect. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said, </span>in his unique style: Have <span class="gemarra-regular">you removed the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">im</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the world? </span>Is there no <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who holds this position? The possibility of retroactive designation with regard to rabbinic enactments <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a dispute among <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: One said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hereby establishing an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the entire</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that <span class="gemarra-regular">if I want </span>to make use of it, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">walk </span>two thousand cubits from the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, and <span class="gemarra-regular">if I do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">want </span>to do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not walk. If he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wanted </span>to make use of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for a particular Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day, his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for that Shabbat. However, if he only decided <span class="gemarra-regular">after nightfall </span>that he wanted the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> to be in effect, the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> disagree: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: His </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and the Rabbis say: His</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This indicates that according to the Rabbis there is no retroactive designation, even with regard to <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span>, while Rabbi Shimon holds that his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is in effect because of the principle of retroactive designation.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we hear</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that Rabbi Shimon does not accept </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">retroactive</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> designation </span>in the case of wine from <span class="it-text">Kutim</span>? The contradiction between one ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon and </span>another ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reverse </span>the opinions and say that it is Rabbi Shimon who holds that his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is not valid, and therefore he can be identified as the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who holds that there is no retroactive designation at all, even with regard to rabbinic decrees. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the difficulty </span>here? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is with regard to Torah law that Rabbi Shimon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not accept </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">retroactive designation, but with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to rabbinic </span>decrees, <span class="gemarra-regular">he does accept </span>the principle of retroactive designation. Therefore, it is not necessary to reverse the opinions. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who accepts </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">retroactive designation accepts it </span>in all cases; <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">no difference </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah law and rabbinic </span>decrees. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who does not accept </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">retroactive designation does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not accept it </span>at all; <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no difference </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah law and rabbinic </span>decrees. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The distinction between the case of the wine and the other cases is not related to the principle of retroactive designation. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the case of the wine of a <span class="it-text">Kuti</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">is different, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we require </span>that the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> be <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>of your produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">whose remnants are recognizable. </span>Since <span class="it-text">teruma</span> is called the first, if it is not clear which portion was separated and which portion is left over, the designation of part of the wine as <span class="it-text">teruma</span> is not effective, despite the fact that Rabbi Shimon accepts the principle of retroactive designation. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: </span>Do you really think that this ruling is correct? <span class="gemarra-regular">But if that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">there were two pomegranates </span>that were <span class="gemarra-italic">tevel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he said: If rain falls today, this</span> pomegranate <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for that </span>other pomegranate, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rain does not fall today, that </span>second pomegranate <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for this </span>first one, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, whether </span>rain <span class="gemarra-regular">fell</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or did not fall, there is no </span>significance to <span class="gemarra-regular">his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> statement </span>because the remnants that are not <span class="it-text">teruma</span> are not immediately recognizable. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that indeed, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is so, </span>there is a difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna that if one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of this pile </span>of produce <span class="gemarra-regular">and its tithes shall be inside it, </span>without specifying the location of the produce that he is designating for these purposes, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>similarly, if one says about a pile of first-tithe produce: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of this tithe shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be inside it, </span>without specifying the location, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: He has given it a name, </span>i.e., the designation of the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes take effect, even though it is impossible to distinguish between them and the permitted portion of the produce? Therefore, it is not necessary for the remnants of the act of separation to be recognizable. 
Rava refutes this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>with regard to a pile of produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is different because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there are </span>recognizable remnants <span class="gemarra-regular">around it. </span>He specified that the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> should be inside the heap, which indicates that it is in the middle of the pile, and therefore the produce on the perimeter of the pile is certainly not <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, and some of the remnants of the act of separation are recognizable. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, </span>you can reconcile the difference between the case of separating <span class="it-text">teruma</span> from wine and the other cases and <span class="gemarra-regular">say in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with the reason that was taught </span>in the case of the wine: The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rabbi Meir: Don’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you concede </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps the </span>leather <span class="gemarra-regular">flask will burs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> before he manages to separate the <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and retroactively this </span>person would have been <span class="gemarra-regular">drinking </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tevel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Since he never ended up separating <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, the wine remained <span class="it-text">tevel</span> all along. Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: When it bursts, </span>I will consider the matter, but presently I am not concerned that the bottle might burst. Therefore, we see that these <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> do not disagree about the principle of retroactive designation but over the likelihood that the flask will burst. 
The Gemara now asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to what initially</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> entered our minds, </span>which is <span class="gemarra-regular">that we require </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> that is <span class="gemarra-regular">the first, whose remnants are recognizable what did </span>the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>Rabbi Meir about that? That is the objection they should have raised against him. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what they said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: According to our </span>own opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> that is <span class="gemarra-regular">the first, whose remnants are recognizable; according to your</span> opinion, 

Daf 38a

<span class="gemarra-regular">don’t you </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">concede </span>that we must be concerned that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps the </span>leather <span class="gemarra-regular">flask will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">burst, and retroactively this </span>person would have been <span class="gemarra-regular">drinking </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tevel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: When it bursts</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> I will consider the matter, but now I am not concerned about this possibility.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival adjacent to Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">whether before it, </span>on a Friday, <span class="gemarra-regular">or after it, </span>on a Sunday, <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span> of Shabbat borders [<span class="it-text">teḥumin</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">and say </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">My </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>day shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">to the east, and on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the second </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">to the west. </span>Alternatively, one may say: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the first </span>day it shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">to the west</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and on the second </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">to the east. </span>Similarly, one may say: <span class="gemarra-regular">My </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> shall apply <span class="gemarra-regular">on the first </span>day, <span class="gemarra-regular">but on the second </span>day I shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the inhabitants of my town, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">My </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> shall apply <span class="gemarra-regular">on the second </span>day, <span class="gemarra-regular">but on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>day I shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inhabitants of my town.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis </span>disagree and <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that such a split is impossible. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">he either establishes an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">direction </span>for both days, <span class="gemarra-regular">or he establishes no </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all; either he establishes an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">two days, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or he establishes no </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at all. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What does one do </span>to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> that will be valid for both the Festival and Shabbat? <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>or his agent <span class="gemarra-regular">brings </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> to the location that he wishes to establish as his residence <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the eve of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>day, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he stays </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it until nightfall, </span>the time when the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> establishes that location as his residence for the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">takes it </span>with him <span class="gemarra-regular">and goes away</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span>so that it will not become lost before the following evening, in which case he would not have an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the second day. <span class="gemarra-regular">On </span>the eve of the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>day, he takes it back to the same place as the day before, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he stays </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">with it until nightfall, </span>thereby establishing his residence for Shabbat, and then he may <span class="gemarra-regular">eat </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and go away, </span>if he so desires. <span class="gemarra-regular">Consequently</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he benefits </span>in that he is permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">walk </span>in the direction that he desires, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he benefits </span>in that he is permitted to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
However, if the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was eaten</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>day, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> is effective <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>day, <span class="gemarra-regular">and his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span>effective <span class="gemarra-regular">for the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> second </span>day.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer said to them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">you agree with me that </span>Shabbat and a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">constitute two </span>distinct <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctities, </span>as if not, the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> that went into effect during the twilight period on the eve of the first day should have remained in effect for both days, even if it was eaten during the first day. This being the case, you should also agree with me that one can make two separate <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span> for the two days in two different directions. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the wording employed by the Rabbis: First, the Rabbis state that one may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in one direction. What does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>mean? He must establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in that direction <span class="gemarra-regular">for two days. </span>Then they state that he may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for two days. What does this </span>mean? He must establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the two days <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one direction. </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>exactly the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>clause. 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what the Rabbis said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Eliezer: Don’t you concede that </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one day, one may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for half </span>the day <span class="gemarra-regular">to the north and </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of it to the south</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Rabbi Eliezer <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them: Indeed, </span>I agree. They then said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as one may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for one day, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the day <span class="gemarra-regular">to the north and half </span>the day <span class="gemarra-regular">to the south, so too, one may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for two </span>consecutive <span class="gemarra-regular">days </span>of sanctity, <span class="gemarra-regular">one day to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the east and one day to the west.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span>respond? He holds as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>one day constitutes <span class="gemarra-regular">one sanctity, </span>and it is impossible to impossible to divide the day such that the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> applies to one direction for one half of the day and to another direction for the other half of the day. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>where Shabbat and a Festival fall out on consecutive days, they are <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctities, </span>and therefore one can establish separate <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span> for the two days.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Eliezer said to </span>the Rabbis: <span class="gemarra-regular">Don’t you concede that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if one established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his fee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> by actually going to the place where he desires to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the eve of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first day </span>and remaining there during the twilight period, as opposed to depositing food there beforehand, he nonetheless must <span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span>another <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> feet on </span>the eve of <span class="gemarra-regular">the second day, </span>and one <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> does not suffice; similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was eaten</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the first day, he may not </span>rely <span class="gemarra-regular">on it</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">go out </span>beyond the limit permitted to the rest of the inhabitants of his town <span class="gemarra-regular">on the second day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>
The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: Indeed, </span>that is correct. Rabbi Eliezer then <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to them: </span>Then <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it </span>correct that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two </span>distinct <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctities, </span>and therefore one should be permitted to establish two separate <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span> for the two days? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how do <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>respond? <span class="gemarra-regular">They are in doubt </span>about this issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore their ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">here is stringent </span>and prohibits establishing separate <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span> for the two days in different directions, in case the two days are considered a single sanctity; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>their ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">here is stringent </span>and they require a separate <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for each day, in case the two days are considered distinct sanctities. 
The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rabbi Eliezer: Don’t you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">concede that one may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> initially on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival for Shabbat, </span>i.e., if a Festival occurs on a Friday and one forgot to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> on the eve of the Festival, he may not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for Shabbat on the Festival itself? Rabbi Eliezer <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Indeed, </span>that is correct. They said to him: Then <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it </span>correct that the two days constitute <span class="gemarra-regular">one sanctity? </span>
The Gemara responds that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span>holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is so not because the two days constitute a single sanctity, but <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">preparatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> on a Festival for Shabbat, which includes establishing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his feet </span>by going to the place he wished to establish as his residence <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span> the eve of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first day </span>and remaining there during the twilight period, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span>another <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his feet on </span>the eve of <span class="gemarra-regular">the second day. </span>Similarly, if he had established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> by depositing food in the place he wished to establish as his residence, and <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was eaten on the first day, he may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>rely <span class="gemarra-regular">on it </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">go out </span>beyond the limit permitted to the rest of the inhabitants of the town <span class="gemarra-regular">on the second day. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi</span> Yehuda HaNasi. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says:</span>

Daf 38b

<span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in the position of both <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey driver, </span>who must prod the animal from behind, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a camel driver, </span>who must lead the animal from the front, i.e., he is pulled in two opposing directions. Since we are unsure whether the two days constitute one sanctity or two, he must act stringently as though the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> established for the first day is both effective and not effective for the second day, i.e., he must restrict his Shabbat movement to those areas where he would be permitted to go in both cases. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, say: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his feet on </span>the eve of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>day, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his feet on </span>the eve of <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>day, as his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> remains effective for the second day as well. Similarly, if he had made an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> by depositing food in the place where he wished to establish his residence, and <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was eaten on the first day, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may </span>still rely <span class="gemarra-regular">on it </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">go out </span>beyond the limit permitted to the rest of the inhabitants of the town <span class="gemarra-regular">on the second </span>day, as the two days constitute one sanctity; from the outset, the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> acquired his place of rest for both days.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span><span class="gemarra-regular">four Elder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eliezer, who said: </span>When Shabbat and a Festival occur on consecutive days, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>constitute <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>distinct <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctities</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these are the four </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elders</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel; Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka; Rabbi Eliezer, son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon; and Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda, the </span>one whose opinions were often recorded as <span class="gemarra-regular">unattributed </span><span class="it-text">mishnayot</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say: One of them is Rabbi Elazar, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and remove </span>from the list <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda, the </span>one whose statements were often recorded as <span class="gemarra-regular">unattributed </span><span class="it-text">mishnayot</span>. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we hear that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, </span>maintain <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> opposite </span>opinion in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited above, namely that the two days constitute a single sanctity? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Reverse</span> the attributions in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, this is </span>exactly what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi said. What is their dispute? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that there is no disagreement between them, and the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should read as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">And so too, Rabban </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon ben Gamliel said </span>that he agrees with what was stated above. 
The Gemara now asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us also count Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi among these Elders, as he too holds that the two days are distinct sanctities. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">taught this </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he himself <span class="gemarra-regular">did not hold</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>to be correct. He transmitted a ruling that he received from his teachers, but his own opinion was otherwise.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: If so, let us also say that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and Rabbi Yishmael <span class="gemarra-regular">also taught </span>this law, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">did not hold it </span>to be correct. What proof is there that this represents their own opinions? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>did not rely on the wording of these sources; rather, he <span class="gemarra-regular">learned by </span>way of a definite <span class="gemarra-regular">tradition </span>that these four Elders maintained this position.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rav Huna, </span>Rav’s preeminent student, <span class="gemarra-regular">passed away</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ḥisda entered </span>the study hall <span class="gemarra-regular">to raise a contradiction between </span>one statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and</span> another statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav: Did Rav </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the four Elders</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that when Shabbat and a Festival fall out on consecutive days, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>constitute <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>distinct <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctities? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it stated </span>that with regard to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat and a Festival </span>occur on consecutive days, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>An egg that <span class="gemarra-regular">was laid on one is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited on the other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> just as an egg that was laid on a Festival day is prohibited on that same day? This statement indicates that the two days constitute a single sanctity. How, then, can he say here that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion that they are two distinct sanctities? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said </span>that a distinction may be drawn between the cases: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the egg is prohibited on the second day not because the two days constitute a single sanctity but <span class="gemarra-regular">because of </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">preparation, </span>i.e., because it is prohibited to prepare things on a Festival for Shabbat or on Shabbat for a Festival. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse that states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it shall come to pass, on the sixth day, when</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they shall prepare </span>that which they bring in” (Exodus 16:5), indicates as follows: On an ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">weekday one may prepare</span> what is needed <span class="gemarra-regular">for Shabbat, and </span>similarly, on an ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">weekday one may prepare </span>what is needed <span class="gemarra-regular">for a Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>However, on <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival one may not prepare for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, and </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat one may not prepare for a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival. </span>Therefore, an egg that was laid on a Festival is prohibited on Shabbat not because they constitute a single sanctity, but because it is prohibited to prepare on one sanctified day for another. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But </span>what about <span class="gemarra-regular">that which we learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">What does he do </span>if a Festival occurs on Friday, and he wishes to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> that will be valid for the Festival and Shabbat? <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>or his agent <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> to the spot that he wishes to establish as his residence <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the eve of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>day, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he stays </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">with it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">until nightfall, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he takes it </span>with him <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">goes away. On the </span>eve of the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>day, i.e., on Friday afternoon, he or his agent takes the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> back to the same place <span class="gemarra-regular">and stays </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it until nightfall, and </span>then he may <span class="gemarra-regular">eat </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and go away, </span>if he so desires. <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> preparing on a Festival for Shabbat? </span>According to Rabba, this should be considered a prohibited act of preparation. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said to him: Do you think that the</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> acquires </span>one’s residence <span class="gemarra-regular">at the end of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day, </span>i.e., at the last moment of Shabbat eve, which in this case is a Festival, so that this would involve prohibited preparation? <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> acquires </span>his residence <span class="gemarra-regular">at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the beginning of the day, </span>i.e., at the first moment of Shabbat, which means that no preparations were made for Shabbat on the Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">prepare for </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">itself.</span>
Abaye asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if that is so, one should </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with flasks </span>of wine that were filled from a barrel of first-tithe that was still <span class="it-text">tevel</span> with respect to <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe, and with regard to which one said: Let this wine in the flask be <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe for the wine in the barrel only after nightfall. If you say that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> acquires one’s residence at the beginning of the day, why was it determined that one may not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with such wine?
The Gemara answers: In that case the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is not valid for a different reason: <span class="gemarra-regular">We require a meal that is fit</span> to be eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">while it is still day, and there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is none, </span>as the wine in the flask remains <span class="it-text">tevel</span> and therefore unfit for drinking until nightfall. 
Abaye asked further: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>what about <span class="gemarra-regular">that which we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival is adjacent to Shabbat, whether before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it or after it, a person may establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Why are these <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span> valid? <span class="gemarra-regular">Don’t we require a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">meal that is fit </span>to be eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">while it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">still day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and there is none? </span>Since one established his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in one direction for the first day, he can only travel within a two-thousand-cubit radius of that location. Therefore, if he established his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the second day in the opposite direction, he cannot access that <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> during the first day. 
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you think that </span>we are dealing with a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he placed </span>one <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in the furthest possible spot <span class="gemarra-regular">at the end of two thousand cubits in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>direction, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he placed the other <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in the furthest possible spot <span class="gemarra-regular">at the end of two thousand cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in that </span>direction, and he is therefore unable to go from one to the other on one day? <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the case is <span class="gemarra-regular">that he placed </span>one <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">at the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">end of one thousand cubits in the this direction, and </span>he placed the other <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">at the end of one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thousand cubits in that </span>direction, so that even after acquiring his residence on one side of the town by means of the first <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, he can still go to the spot where he left the other <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the second day.
Abaye raised yet another difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>what about <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his feet </span>for the <span class="gemarra-regular">first day, he may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his feet </span>for the <span class="gemarra-regular">second day; </span>and if <span class="gemarra-regular">he established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with bread on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first day, he may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with bread on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Isn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he preparing from a Festival to Shabbat? </span>
Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Do you think that one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">must go and say something </span>at the site of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, therefore performing an act of preparation? <span class="gemarra-regular">He goes, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and is silent, and sits </span>there, and he automatically acquires his residence without having to say or do anything. This does not fall into the category of prohibited preparation.
Abaye asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion do you say that nothing must be said when establishing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">teḥumin</span>? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, who said: </span>A sleeping person acquires a Shabbat residence in the spot where he is sleeping. Even though he is comparable to ownerless property, <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless property </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires a Shabbat residence </span>and has its own Shabbat boundary, and there is no need for a person to establish a residence for it in a particular spot.
Rabba replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even if you say </span>that my statement is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri </span><span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to a sleeping person, who cannot say </span>anything, as he is asleep. Consequently, he cannot acquire a Shabbat residence. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, with regard to </span>one who is <span class="gemarra-regular">awake, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">if he wanted to speak he could speak, even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">though he did not say </span>that he is acquiring his Shabbat residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is considered as one who did say </span>that statement. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Ḥanin said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Abaye: If the Master, </span>Rabba, <span class="gemarra-regular">had heard that which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was taught </span>in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> walk to the end of his field </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> determine what </span>work and repair <span class="gemarra-regular">it requires, </span>which will be done after Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Similarly, </span>

Daf 39a

<span class="gemarra-regular">a person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not stroll at the entrance to the city </span>toward the end of Shabbat or a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enter a bathhous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> immediately </span>upon the conclusion of Shabbat, then Rabba would have <span class="gemarra-regular">retracted his </span>statement with regard to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> indicates that even walking on Shabbat for something one needs after Shabbat falls into the category of prohibited preparation.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is not </span>correct. Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">heard this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but did not retract </span>his ruling, as a distinction can be drawn between the cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> pertaining to one who walks to the end of his field, or one who strolls at the entrance to the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is clear </span>to all observers that he is doing so in order to determine what work the field needs after Shabbat, or to enter the bathhouse immediately after Shabbat, respectively. Whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not clear </span>to others that one’s actions are for the purpose of establishing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he is a Torah scholar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzurva</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">merabbanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we, </span>the observers, would <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>Perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> study pulled him, </span>i.e., he was engrossed in his study and was not paying attention to where he was going. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he is an ignoramus, we </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">he lost </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">donkey </span>and went to look for it. His actions give no indication that he is going to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the following day, as establishing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> does not require any recognizable action. 
The Gemara now examines Rav Yehuda’s statement <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, </span>which was cited in the course of the previous discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his feet on </span>the eve of the <span class="gemarra-regular">first day, he may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">feet on </span>the eve of <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>day as well. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with bread </span>that he deposited in the place where he wishes to acquire his place of rest <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the eve of the <span class="gemarra-regular">first day, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with bread on </span>the eve of the <span class="gemarra-regular">second day </span>as well. 
If <span class="gemarra-regular">he established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with bread on </span>the eve of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>day, and his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was eaten, he may change and <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his feet</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on </span>the eve of <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>day. However, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his feet on </span>the eve of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>day, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with bread on </span>the eve of <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>day, as <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not initially establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with bread </span>on a Festival for the sake of Shabbat because it is prohibited to prepare on a Festival for Shabbat. 
With regard to the statement: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with bread on </span>the eve of the <span class="gemarra-regular">first day, he may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bread on </span>the eve of the <span class="gemarra-regular">second day, Shmuel said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Only <span class="gemarra-regular">with the same bread</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>The wording of <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna is also precise </span>according to this understanding, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned: What does he do </span>if a Festival occurs on Friday, and he wishes to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> that will be valid for both the Festival and Shabbat? <span class="gemarra-regular">He brings </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> to the spot that he wishes to establish as his residence <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the eve of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>day, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he stays </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">with it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">until nightfall, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he takes it </span>with him <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">goes away. On </span>the eve of <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>day, he takes the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> back to the same place as the day before, and <span class="gemarra-regular">stays </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">with it until nightfall, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">eat </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and go away. </span>The wording of the mishna indicates that he must establish his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the second day with the same bread that he used for the first day, as argued by Shmuel. 
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who do not accept the opinion of Shmuel, argue that this is no proof, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps there, </span>the mishna is merely <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us good advic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> as to how one can rely on a single <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> and avoid having to prepare an additional <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the second day. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> During the time period when the Jewish calendar was established by the court according to the testimony of witnesses who had seen the new moon, Rosh HaShana would be observed for only one day if witnesses arrived on that day, and for two days if witnesses failed to arrive and the month of Elul was declared to be an extended, thirty-day month. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rosh HaShana, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">feared that </span>the month of Elul <span class="gemarra-regular">might be extended, </span>and he wanted to travel in two different directions on the two days that could be Rosh HaShana, this <span class="gemarra-regular">person may establish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and say: My </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the first </span>day shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">to the east and on the second </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">to the west, </span>or alternatively: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the first </span>day it shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">to the west, and on the second </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">to the east. </span>Similarly, he may say: <span class="gemarra-regular">My </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> shall apply <span class="gemarra-regular">on the first </span>day, <span class="gemarra-regular">but on the second</span> day I shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the inhabitants</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of my town, </span>or alternatively: <span class="gemarra-regular">My </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> shall apply <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the second </span>day, <span class="gemarra-regular">but on the first </span>day I shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the inhabitants of my town</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And the Rabbis did not agree with him </span>that the two days of Rosh HaShana can be divided in such a manner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehuda said further, </span>with regard to the two days of Rosh HaShana that one observes because he does not know which is the real day of the Festival: <span class="gemarra-regular">A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person may make a condition </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a basket</span> of <span class="it-text">tevel</span> produce <span class="gemarra-regular">on the first day of the Festival</span> and say as follows: If today is the Festival and tomorrow is an ordinary weekday I will separate the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes tomorrow, and I have performed nothing today; if today is an ordinary weekday, I hereby separate the appropriate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes now. <span class="gemarra-regular">He may </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">eat </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">on the second </span>day of the Festival, since one of his two acts of tithing was certainly performed on an ordinary weekday.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an egg that was laid on the first </span>day of the Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">may be eaten on the second </span>day, since one of the days is certainly an ordinary weekday. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis did not agree with him </span>even with regard to these two days. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa ben Harekinas says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One who passes before the ark </span>in the synagogue and leads the congregation in prayer <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the first day of <span class="gemarra-regular">the festival of Rosh HaShana says: Strengthen us</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> O </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lord our God, on this day of the New Moon,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whether </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">today or tomorrow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the following day he says: Whether </span>Rosh HaShana is <span class="gemarra-regular">today</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or yesterday. And the Rabbis did not agree with hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> that one should formulate his prayer in this conditional manner. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>the Sages who <span class="gemarra-regular">did not agree with </span>Rabbi Yehuda? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: It is </span>those who follow the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, as it was taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: Even though <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>disagree with him about a Festival and Shabbat that occur on consecutive days and say that one cannot make two separate <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span> for the two days, they <span class="gemarra-regular">concede to Rabbi Eliezer </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rosh HaShana that</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">a person feared that </span>the month of Elul <span class="gemarra-regular">might</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be extended, he may establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and say: My</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the first </span>day shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">to the east</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and on the second </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">to the west, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">On</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the first </span>day it shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">to the west, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the second </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">to the east, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">My </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> shall apply <span class="gemarra-regular">on the first </span>day, <span class="gemarra-regular">but on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>day I shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inhabitants of my town, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">My </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> shall apply <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>day, <span class="gemarra-regular">but on the first </span>day I shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the inhabitants of my town. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei prohibits </span>it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosei said to </span>the Rabbis: <span class="gemarra-regular">Don’t you concede that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if witnesses came from the </span>time of <span class="gemarra-italic">minḥa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> on the first day of Rosh HaShana and testified that they had seen the new moon, we do not rely on their testimony to sanctify that day as Rosh HaShana; rather, since their testimony was not given on time, <span class="gemarra-regular">we observe that day as sanctified and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">the following</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day as sanctified? </span>This indicates that the two days of Rosh HaShana are not observed out of doubt as to which is the proper day; rather, it is as though the two days are one long day that are imbued with one unified sanctity. Therefore, it should not be possible to divide them.

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>hold that <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the first day is not observed as a Festival by Torah law but due to rabbinic decree, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">will not demean </span>the day in future years and end up desecrating the Festival should the witnesses come on time. However, by Torah law it is an ordinary weekday, and therefore one can establish two separate <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span> for the two days. 
We learned in the mishna that in addition to his ruling with regard to <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span> for the two days of Rosh HaShana, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said further </span>that the two days can be split with regard to a basket of <span class="it-text">tevel</span> produce and an egg laid on the first day of the Festival. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach us all three laws, as they could not have been derived from one another. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if he had </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to establishing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the two days of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rosh </span><span class="gemarra-regular">HaShana, </span>one might have said that only <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>case does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda say </span>his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">do anything </span>on the Festival itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a basket, where it appears</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as though one is rendering </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tevel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fit </span>on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes to the Rabbis </span>that it is decreed prohibited. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And had he taught us</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">these two </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span>, we might have said that Rabbi Yehuda is lenient <span class="gemarra-regular">because there is no </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">to issue</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a decree </span>prohibiting <span class="gemarra-regular">them, </span>as the potential prohibitions involved are not so severe. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">egg </span>that was laid on the first day of a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">to issue a decree </span>prohibiting <span class="gemarra-regular">it, </span>as explained in tractate <span class="it-text">Beitza</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">because of fruit that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fall </span>from a tree or <span class="gemarra-regular">due to liquids that oozed </span>from fruit on a Festival, both of which the Sages prohibited as a safeguard against violating Torah prohibitions, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>which maintains that this egg may not be eaten even on the second day of the Festival. It was therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary</span> to teach us all three cases.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>is one to carry out what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">make a condition </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a basket </span>of <span class="it-text">tevel</span> produce <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first day of the Festival and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">eat </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">on the second </span>day? If <span class="gemarra-regular">there were two baskets of</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tevel</span> produce <span class="gemarra-regular">before him, he says </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> today is </span>an ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">weekday and tomorrow is sanctified, let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>basket <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for that </span>basket; <span class="gemarra-regular">and if today</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is sanctified and tomorrow </span>is an ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">weekday, my statement</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has no </span>significance. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he bestows upon </span>the basket <span class="gemarra-regular">the name </span>of <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and sets it aside. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And on the next day he says </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">If today is </span>an ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">weekday, let this </span>basket <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for that </span>basket; <span class="gemarra-regular">and if today is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sanctified, my statement has no </span>significance. <span class="gemarra-regular">And He bestows upon </span>the basket <span class="gemarra-regular">the name </span>of <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he may then <span class="gemarra-regular">eat </span>the produce in the other basket, as <span class="it-text">teruma</span> has definitely been separated on a weekday. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei prohibits</span> this. <span class="gemarra-regular">And, so too, Rabbi Yosei would prohibit </span>this procedure even <span class="gemarra-regular">on the two Festival days of the Diaspora, </span>even though the second day is only observed because of a doubt as to the proper day on which to observe the Festival.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">a particular young deer was brought </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the house of the Exilarch. </span>The deer <span class="gemarra-regular">was trapped </span>by a gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">on the first day of a Festival </span>observed <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Diaspora and slaughtered on the second day </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The question arose whether it was permitted to eat it, based on the fact that one of these two days was certainly an ordinary weekday. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman and Rav Ḥisda ate </span>from it, but <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet did not eat </span>from it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said </span>in a jesting manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">What can I do for Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sheshet, who does not eat deer meat? Rav Sheshet said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: How can I eat </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Isi taught, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and some say </span>that this should be read as a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Isi teach: And, so too, Rabbi Yosei </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would prohibit </span>this procedure even <span class="gemarra-regular">on the two Festival days </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the Diaspora? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">What is the difficulty? Perhaps this is what he said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And, so too, Rabbi Yosei would prohibit </span>this procedure even <span class="gemarra-regular">on the two Festival days of Rosh HaShana in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Diaspora</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but with regard to the two days of other Festivals observed in the Diaspora, he too would agree with Rabbi Yehuda and permit it. They said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Diaspora </span>is inappropriate. <span class="gemarra-regular">It should have </span>said <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Diaspora.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi said: What is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">difficulty? Perhaps this is what he said: And so too</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Rabbi Yosei would treat the prohibition </span>of such a procedure <span class="gemarra-regular">on the two Festival days of the Diaspora as on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the two Festival days of Rosh HaShana, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, who permit </span>it. In any case, the proof from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is inconclusive.
The Gemara further relates that afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet met Rabba bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Has the Master learned anything </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the two <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctities </span>of a Festival and the like? Rabba bar Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: We have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei concedes with regard to the two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival days of the Diaspora. </span>Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If you </span>happen to <span class="gemarra-regular">meet </span>Rav Naḥman and Rav Ḥisda, who disagreed with me and ate the deer in the Exilarch’s house, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not tell them anything </span>of what you just told me, lest they use this <span class="it-text">tannaitic</span> source to embarrass me about my refusal to eat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ashi said: Ameimar told me that the deer was not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">trapped </span>on the Festival; 

Daf 40a

<span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>it had already been caught beforehand, but it <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>to the Exilarch’s house on the Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">from outside the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and was slaughtered on that day. <span class="gemarra-regular">The one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>from it, namely, Rav Naḥman and Rav Ḥisda, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: </span>Something <span class="gemarra-regular">that comes </span>from outside the Shabbat limit <span class="gemarra-regular">for one Jew </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to another Jew</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>Since the deer was brought for the Exilarch, the Sages at his table were permitted to eat from it, and we do not prohibit them to derive benefit from something that a gentile did for another Jew.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">did not eat </span>from it, Rav Sheshet, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: Anything that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">comes to the house of the Exilarch comes with all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages in mind, </span>as it is known that the Exilarch invites them to dine with him on Festivals. Therefore, just as it was prohibited to the Exilarch himself, as it was brought from outside the Shabbat limit, so too, it was prohibited to all his guests.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rav Sheshet meet Rabba bar Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and say to him </span>what he said, indicating that the issue is related to the question of whether the two days are considered distinct sanctities? The Gemara answers: According to Ameimar’s version of the story, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>encounter <span class="gemarra-regular">never happened</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara relates that a delivery of <span class="gemarra-regular">turnip </span>was once <span class="gemarra-regular">brought to </span>the town of <span class="gemarra-regular">Meḥoza </span>by gentile merchants from outside the Shabbat limit on a Festival in the Diaspora. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava went out </span>to the market and <span class="gemarra-regular">saw </span>that the turnips <span class="gemarra-regular">were withered, and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">he permitted</span> people <span class="gemarra-regular">to buy them </span>immediately without having to wait the amount of time needed to bring similar items from outside the limit after the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said: These </span>turnips <span class="gemarra-regular">were</span> certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">uprooted </span>from the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">yesterday, </span>and no prohibited labor was performed with them today. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>might <span class="gemarra-regular">you say; </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they came</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from outside the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit </span>and should therefore be prohibited? The accepted principle is: Something <span class="gemarra-regular">that comes for one Jew</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted to be eaten by another Jew, and all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the more so </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>delivery of turnip, <span class="gemarra-regular">which came with gentiles in mind, </span>i.e., for their sake rather than for the sake of Jews. Therefore, if they are purchased by Jews, no prohibition is violated. 
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Once </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">saw that </span>the gentile merchants started to <span class="gemarra-regular">bring increased </span>quantities of turnips on Festival days for the sake of their Jewish customers, <span class="gemarra-regular">he prohibited </span>the inhabitants of Meḥoza to buy them, for it was evident that they were now being brought for Jews.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">certain canopy makers, </span>who would braid myrtle branches into their canopies, once <span class="gemarra-regular">cut myrtles on the second day of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festival, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">in the evening Ravina permitted </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">to smell</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> immediately </span>at the conclusion of the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Taḥalifa said to Ravina: The Master should prohibit them </span>to do this, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they are not knowledgeable in Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore we should be stringent with them lest they come to treat the sanctity of the second Festival day lightly. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shemaya strongly objects to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this: The reason </span>given here is <span class="gemarra-regular">that they are not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> knowledgeable in Torah; </span>but if <span class="gemarra-regular">they were knowledgeable in Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, would it be permitted? Don’t we require </span>them to wait <span class="gemarra-regular">the time needed for </span>the myrtle’s <span class="gemarra-regular">preparation, </span>i.e., the time it takes to cut them? <span class="gemarra-regular">They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">went and asked Rava. He said to them: We require </span>them to wait <span class="gemarra-regular">the time needed for </span>the myrtle’s <span class="gemarra-regular">preparation.</span>
The mishna cited Rabbi Dosa’s version of the Rosh HaShana prayer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa says: He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who passes before the ark </span>and leads the congregation in prayer on the first day of the festival of Rosh HaShana says: Strengthen us, O Lord our God, on this day of the New Moon, whether it is today or tomorrow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: When we were in the house </span>of study <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Huna, we raised the </span>following <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to whether it is proper <span class="gemarra-regular">to mention the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> New Moon </span>during prayer <span class="gemarra-regular">on Rosh HaShana? </span>The Gemara explains the two sides of the dilemma: Do we say that <span class="gemarra-regular">since they have separate additional offerings, </span>as one additional offering is brought for the New Moon and another for Rosh HaShana, <span class="gemarra-regular">we mention </span>them separately in prayer as well? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps one remembrance counts for </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">this and that</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The Torah is referring to both Rosh HaShana and the New Moon as times of remembrance, and therefore perhaps simply mentioning that it is a Day of Remembrance should suffice. 
Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to us: You have </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>the answer to this question in the mishna, which states that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa says: He who passes before the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ark </span>and leads the congregation in prayer on the first day and on the second day of Rosh HaShana mentions the New Moon in a conditional manner: On this day of the New Moon, whether it is today or tomorrow. But the Rabbis did not agree with him. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it not </span>that the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Dosa about the need <span class="gemarra-regular">to mention </span>the New Moon during prayer on Rosh HaShana? 
The Gemara refutes this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>they disagree about whether <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">make a condition. </span>The novelty in Rabbi Dosa’s teaching was not that mention must be made of the New Moon, but that a condition must be made due to the day’s uncertain status. The Rabbis disagree about that. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">So </span><span class="gemarra-regular">too, it is reasonable </span>to say that the dispute between Rabbi Dosa and the Rabbis relates to the condition and not to the very mention of the New Moon. This can be ascertained <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it was taught </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: And so too, Rabbi Dosa would do </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">the New Moons </span>for which two days are kept out of doubt <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire year; and </span>the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">did not agree with him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that the disagreement was about whether <span class="gemarra-regular">to make a condition, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is why they did not agree with him </span>with regard to the New Moon throughout the year, as they did not accept the whole idea of a conditional prayer. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>the main point of contention was whether <span class="gemarra-regular">to mention </span>the New Moon at all, <span class="gemarra-regular">why didn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t they agree with him </span>that the New Moon should be mentioned during prayer the rest of the year? 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>is the disagreement about, whether or not <span class="gemarra-regular">to make a condition? Why do I</span> need them <span class="gemarra-regular">to disagree in two </span>cases? The issue is the same on Rosh HaShana as on any other New Moon. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary </span>to teach both cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">as, if he had </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rosh HaShana, I might have said </span>that only <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">did the Rabbis say that one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should not </span>mention the New Moon in a conditional manner <span class="gemarra-regular">because people might come to demean </span>the day and perform prohibited labor. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in </span>the case of an ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">New</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Moon throughout the year, </span>I might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> agree with Rabbi Dosa, </span>since labor is not prohibited on the New Moon, and therefore there is no reason for concern lest people come to treat it lightly. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the disagreement <span class="gemarra-regular">had </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">been stated in this </span>case, in the case of an ordinary New Moon, one might say that only <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">did Rabbi Dosa say </span>that a condition may be made. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in that </span>other case of Rosh HaShana, I might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he agrees with the Rabbis, </span>due to concern lest people will come to treat the Festival lightly. It was therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state the disagreement in both cases.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>based on the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> that states that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rosh </span><span class="gemarra-regular">HaShana that occurs on Shabbat, Beit Shammai say: One prays </span>an <span class="it-text">Amida</span> that contains <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>blessings, including the nine blessings ordinarily recited on Rosh HaShana and an additional blessing in which Shabbat is mentioned. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: One prays </span>an <span class="it-text">Amida</span> that contains <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span>blessings, as Shabbat and the Festival are mentioned in the same blessing. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there were </span>an opinion that held that the New Moon must be separately mentioned in the Rosh HaShana prayer, then <span class="gemarra-regular">it should </span>say that according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai, </span>one must recite <span class="gemarra-regular">eleven </span>blessings, i.e., nine for Rosh HaShana, one for Shabbat, and one for the New Moon. 

Daf 40b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: The New Moon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is different, </span>for while it must indeed be mentioned according to Beit Shammai, it does not require a separate blessing. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the New Moon <span class="gemarra-regular">is included </span>in the regular <span class="gemarra-regular">morning</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and evening </span>prayers without a separate blessing, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is included</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the additional </span>prayer <span class="gemarra-regular">as well </span>without a separate blessing. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And do Beit Shammai </span>accept the view that one should <span class="gemarra-regular">include </span>the New Moon in the regular prayer? <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a New Moon that occurs on Shabbat, Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shammai say: One </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">pray </span>an <span class="it-text">Amida</span> that includes <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>blessings in the additional prayer, including a separate blessing for the New Moon; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel say: One must pray</span> an <span class="it-text">Amida</span> that includes <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>blessings, as Shabbat and the New Moon are mentioned in the same blessing? Therefore, according to Beit Shammai, we do not include the New Moon and other days in the same blessing, and the fact that the New Moon does not have its own blessing on Rosh HaShana is because one mention of remembrance counts for both Rosh HaShana and New Moon. The Gemara comments: Indeed, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult.</span>
The Gemara comments: The issue of whether or not one should <span class="gemarra-regular">include </span>the mention of the New Moon in the blessing pertaining to the sanctity of the day of Shabbat is <span class="gemarra-regular">itself </span>the subject of a dispute between the <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to a <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat that occurs on a New</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Moon or on </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">the intermediate days of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festival: </span>For <span class="gemarra-regular">the evening, morning, and afternoon prayers, one prays</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in his </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner </span>and recites <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>blessings, <span class="gemarra-regular">and says</span> a passage pertaining to the <span class="gemarra-regular">event </span>of the day, i.e. May there rise and come [<span class="it-text">ya’aleh</span> <span class="it-text">veyavo</span>], <span class="gemarra-regular">during</span> the blessing of <span class="gemarra-regular">Temple service. Rabbi Eliezer </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says</span> that this passage is said <span class="gemarra-regular">during </span>the blessing of <span class="gemarra-regular">thanksgiving</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And if he did not recite </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">we require him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to return </span>to the beginning of the prayer and repeat it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And in the additional prayer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, one begins </span>the fourth blessing, the special blessing for the additional service, <span class="gemarra-regular">with Shabbat, and concludes </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">with Shabbat, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and says </span>a passage referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the sanctity of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day </span>of the New Moon or the Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">middle. </span>Therefore, only in the additional prayer is the New Moon included in the blessing for the sanctity of the day. 
On the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan ben Beroka, say: Wherever </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to recite <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>blessings, including the evening, morning, and afternoon prayers, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> begins </span>the fourth blessing <span class="gemarra-regular">with Shabbat and concludes </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shabbat, and he says </span>a passage referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the sanctity</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the day </span>of the New Moon or the Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle. </span>In their opinion, the New Moon is included in the blessing of the sanctity of the day in all the prayers of the day. 
Returning to the fundamental question of whether the New Moon must be mentioned separately on Rosh HaShana, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>conclusion <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>reached <span class="gemarra-regular">about this </span>issue? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>mention of <span class="gemarra-regular">remembrance counts for </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">this and that. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And so too, Rabba said: One </span>mention of <span class="gemarra-regular">remembrance counts </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">this and that. </span>
Having discussed the Rosh HaShana prayers, the Gemara addresses related issues. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: When I was in the house </span>of study <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Huna, we raised the </span>following <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to saying </span>the blessing for <span class="gemarra-regular">time, </span>i.e., Who has given us life [<span class="it-text">shehe</span><span class="it-text">ḥ</span><span class="it-text">eyanu</span>], <span class="gemarra-regular">on Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur? </span>The two sides of the dilemma are as follows: Do we say that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>these Festivals <span class="gemarra-regular">come at fixed times </span>of the year, <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">recite </span>the blessing: Who has given us life, just as we would for any other joyous event that occurs at fixed intervals? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>do we say, <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>these Festivals <span class="gemarra-regular">are not called pilgrim Festivals [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">regalim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], we do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> recite: </span>Who has given us life, as the joy that they bring is insufficient? Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">did not have </span>an answer <span class="gemarra-regular">at hand. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">When </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I came to the house </span>of study <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yehuda, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he said: I recite </span>the blessing for <span class="gemarra-regular">time </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a new gourd, </span>and I certainly recite the blessing on Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">I said to him: I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have no dilemma </span>about the fact that one has the <span class="gemarra-regular">option </span>of reciting the blessing for time; <span class="gemarra-regular">the dilemma I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have is </span>about whether there is an <span class="gemarra-regular">obligation </span>to recite the blessing. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this regard? Rav Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to me </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it was Rav and Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who both said: One recites </span>the blessing for <span class="gemarra-regular">time only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on the three pilgrim Festivals.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>based upon the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Give a portion to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seven, and also to eight” </span>(Ecclesiastes 11:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Seven,” these are the seven days of Creation; “eight,” these </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are the eight days </span>until <span class="gemarra-regular">circumcision. Rabbi Yehoshua says: “Seven,” </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these are the seven days of Passover; “eight,” these are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the eight days of the festival </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it says: “And also,” </span>like every other instance of the word “also” in the Torah, this comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to include; </span>what it includes is <span class="gemarra-italic">Shavuot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and Rosh HaShana, and Yom Kippur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What, is </span>this exposition <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> coming <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>teach us that on these days one is obligated to recite the blessing for <span class="gemarra-regular">time? </span>The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the blessing </span>recited over the special sanctity of the day. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is reasonable </span>to explain, <span class="gemarra-regular">as if it would enter your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mind </span>to say that it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the blessing for <span class="gemarra-regular">time, is there </span>a blessing for <span class="gemarra-regular">time </span>that is recited <span class="gemarra-regular">all seven </span>days of the Festival? It is recited only on the first day. The Gemara refutes this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is not difficult, </span>as it means <span class="gemarra-regular">that if he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not recite the blessing </span>for time <span class="gemarra-regular">now, he recites</span> the blessing <span class="gemarra-regular">tomorrow or the following day, </span>as all seven days are part of the pilgrim Festival.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any case, we require </span>that this blessing be recited over <span class="gemarra-regular">a cup </span>of wine, and most people do not have cups of wine for the intermediate days of a Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that this <span class="gemarra-regular">supports Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥman, as Rav Naḥman said: </span>The blessing for <span class="gemarra-regular">time may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be recited even in the market, </span>without a cup of wine. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is not difficult, </span>as the case is that <span class="gemarra-regular">he happened to have a cup; </span>but without a cup of wine, the blessing may not be recited. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>one can recite the blessing over a cup of wine on <span class="gemarra-italic">Shavuot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rosh HaShana; </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">what does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one do on Yom Kippur? If </span>you say that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">should recite the blessing </span>over a cup of wine before the actual commencement of Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">and drink it, </span>there is a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since he recited </span>the blessing for <span class="gemarra-regular">time, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he accepted </span>the sanctity of the day <span class="gemarra-regular">upon himself, and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">caused </span>the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">to be prohibited to himself </span>by the laws of Yom Kippur.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As didn’t Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yirmeya bar Abba say </span>the following <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav, </span>upon observing him recite <span class="it-text">kiddush</span> before the actual commencement of Shabbat: <span class="gemarra-regular">Have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>therefore accepted the obligation to <span class="gemarra-regular">abstain </span>from labor from this point on? <span class="gemarra-regular">And he said to him: Yes, I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>accepted the obligation to <span class="gemarra-regular">abstain </span>from labor. This indicates that once one recites <span class="it-text">kiddush</span> and accepts upon himself the sanctity of the day, all the laws of the day apply to him. Accordingly, if one recited the blessing for time for Yom Kippur, he may no longer eat or drink. 
And if you say that <span class="gemarra-regular">he should recite the blessing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> over </span>a cup of wine <span class="gemarra-regular">and leave it </span>and drink it only after the conclusion of Yom Kippur, this too is difficult, as the principle is that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> recites a blessing </span>over a cup of wine <span class="gemarra-regular">must taste</span> from it. If you say <span class="gemarra-regular">that he should give it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a child, </span>who is not obligated to fast, this too is not feasible because <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, </span>who made a similar suggestion with regard to a different matter, due to a concern that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the child <span class="gemarra-regular">will come to be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> drawn after </span>it. The child might come to drink wine on Yom Kippur even in future years after he comes of age, and we do not institute a practice that might turn into a stumbling block. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>conclusion <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>reached <span class="gemarra-regular">about this </span>matter? Must one recite the blessing: Who has given us life, on Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur? <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages sent Rav Yeimar the Elder</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Rav Ḥisda on the eve of Rosh HaShana. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: Go, see how he acts </span>in this regard and then <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">tell us. When </span>Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">saw </span>Rav Yeimar, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to him </span>in the words of a folk saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who picks up a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">moist log, </span>which is not fit for firewood, must want to do <span class="gemarra-regular">something on the spot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, you certainly have come to me with some purpose in mind, and not just for a visit. <span class="gemarra-regular">They brought him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a cup of wine, and he recited </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kiddush</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the blessing for <span class="gemarra-regular">time</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">recites </span>the blessing for <span class="gemarra-regular">time on Rosh HaShana and on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">recite </span>the blessing for <span class="gemarra-regular">time even in the market, </span>as it does not require a cup of wine. 
Having discussed a question that was raised during Rabba’s student years, the Gemara now records another such question. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said: When we were in the house </span>of study <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Huna, we raised the </span>following <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: A student </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in his master’s house who is fasting on Shabbat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eve, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to whether he has <span class="gemarra-regular">to complete </span>the fast until the end of the day? Do we perhaps say that he must stop fasting before Shabbat, so as not to enter Shabbat weary from his fast? Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">did not have </span>an answer <span class="gemarra-regular">at hand. I </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Yehuda, and he </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">did not have </span>an answer <span class="gemarra-regular">at hand.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Let us look </span>ourselves for an answer from the sources. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Ninth </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Av that occurs on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span>

Daf 41a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so too, </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the eve of the Ninth of Av</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that occurs on Shabbat, </span>one need not reduce the amount of food he eats; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may eat and drink</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as much as he requires and bring to his table</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a meal even like that of </span>King <span class="gemarra-regular">Solomon in his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> time</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If <span class="gemarra-regular">the Ninth of Av occurs on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eve, </span>we <span class="gemarra-regular">bring him an egg-bulk </span>of food toward end of the day, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he eats </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that he not enter Shabbat in a state of affliction. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: We were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">once sitting before Rabbi Akiva, and it was the Ninth </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Av that occurs on Shabbat eve, and they brought </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him a slightly cooked egg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he swallowed it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">without salt. And it was not that he desired it </span>so much that he ate it; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>he did so <span class="gemarra-regular">to show the students </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> that one need not complete the fast when the Ninth of Av occurs on Shabbat eve, so as not enter Shabbat in a state of affliction.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosei says: He must fast and complete </span>the fast. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said to </span>the other Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">Don’t you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">agree with me with regard to the Ninth of Av </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that occurs on Sunday, that one must stop </span>eating on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">while it is still day? They said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Indeed, </span>we agree. Rabbi Yosei <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: What </span>is the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">to me between entering </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">in a state </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of affliction and leaving </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in a state of affliction?</span> If one stops eating before Shabbat is over, he is spending part of Shabbat fasting, and yet even the Sages concede that one must do so. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: </span>There is a difference. <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you said </span>that one may <span class="gemarra-regular">leave </span>Shabbat in a state of affliction, that is <span class="gemarra-regular">because he ate and drank the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> entire day </span>and will not suffer if he fasts a few minutes at the end of the day. Can <span class="gemarra-regular">you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that it is the same <span class="gemarra-regular">to enter </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a state of affliction, </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not eaten or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> drunk </span>anything <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire day? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ulla said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>and on the Ninth of Av that occurs on Shabbat eve one must complete the fast. The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">act in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei? And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a contradiction </span>based upon the following mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">We do not</span> initially <span class="gemarra-regular">decree a fast upon the public on the New</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Moon, Hanukkah, or Purim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and if </span>the community <span class="gemarra-regular">had </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">begun </span>a cycle of fasts and one of them fell out on one of these days, <span class="gemarra-regular">they do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not interrupt </span>the series; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabban Gamliel. Rabbi Meir said: Even though Rabban Gamliel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not interrupt </span>the series, <span class="gemarra-regular">he conceded </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that they do not complete </span>the fast on one of these days, <span class="gemarra-regular">and so too, </span>the fast <span class="gemarra-regular">on the Ninth </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Av that occurs on Shabbat eve </span>is not completed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it was taught </span>in a related <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Following </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the death of Rabban Gamliel, Rabbi Yehoshua entered </span>the study hall <span class="gemarra-regular">to annul </span>Rabban Gamliel’s <span class="gemarra-regular">statement </span>with regard to fasts. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri stood on his feet and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: I see that </span>the appropriate policy is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">body must follow the head, </span>i.e., we must follow the statements of the earlier authorities and not deviate from established <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">All of Rabban Gamliel’s life we established </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with his </span>opinion, and <span class="gemarra-regular">now you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seek to annul his statement? Yehoshua, we do not listen </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to you, as the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has already been established in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel. And there was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">no one who disputed this statement in any way</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>Therefore, this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> demonstrates that when the Ninth of Av occurs on Shabbat eve, one must observe the fast but not complete it, and this was the accepted practice. 
The Gemara resolves the difficulty, arguing that this proof is not conclusive: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">generation of Rabban Gamliel they acted in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">in the generation of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosei they acted in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosei, </span>and from then on, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> follows his view. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is it correct that <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the generation of Rabban Gamliel they acted in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel? Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar ben Tzadok, </span>a contemporary of Rabban Gamliel, <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I am a descendant of Sena’av </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Binyamin, </span>who observed a family festival on the tenth of Av. <span class="gemarra-regular">One time, the Ninth of Av occurred on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, and we postponed it until after Shabbat, </span>as we do not observe the fast on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we fasted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>Sunday <span class="gemarra-regular">but did not complete </span>the fast <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>that day <span class="gemarra-regular">was our Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>they did not complete the fast is that the day itself was <span class="gemarra-regular">a Festival </span>for them, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the eve </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a Festival, they </span>would indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">complete it. </span>This proves that even in the generation of Rabban Gamliel, they did complete fasts on the eve of Shabbat and Festivals.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said </span>that this story poses no difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">A rabbinic Festival is different, </span>as they are not as stringent as Shabbat or Festivals stated in the Torah, and the festival of the family of Sena’av was not a Festival from the Torah, but one established by the Sages. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since one may fast on </span>such a Festival for a number of <span class="gemarra-regular">hours, </span>i.e., one may fast on it for part of the day, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">completes </span>a fast observed on the eve of such a Festival until the <span class="gemarra-regular">evening. </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">since one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not fast on it </span>even for several <span class="gemarra-regular">hours, one does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not complete </span>a fast observed on Shabbat eve.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosef said: I did not hear this ruling </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei. Rav Yosef had fallen ill and forgotten his learning and so was unable to remember that such a ruling had been issued. His student, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye, said to him: You </span>yourself <span class="gemarra-regular">told us </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>point that <span class="gemarra-regular">you told </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to us, </span>as we learned in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">We do not </span>initially <span class="gemarra-regular">decree a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fast upon the public on the New Moon, </span>on Hanukkah, or on Purim. Rabbi Meir said: Even though Rabban Gamliel said that if the community had already begun a cycle of fasts, they do not interrupt the series, he conceded that they do not complete the fast on one of these days, and similarly, the fast of the Ninth of Av that occurs on Shabbat eve is not completed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we said with regard to </span>this mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: This is the statement that Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meir said in the name of Rabban Gamliel. But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis say: One must fast and complete </span>the fast.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What? </span>Does the Rabbis’ ruling that one must complete the fast <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>refer <span class="gemarra-regular">to all </span>the cases mentioned in the mishna, including that of the Ninth of Av that occurs on Shabbat eve? <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it was stated only with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to Hanukkah and Purim, </span>but one would not complete a fast on Shabbat eve. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, it is reasonable </span>to explain that this ruling does not apply to Shabbat eve, 

Daf 41b

<span class="gemarra-regular">as, if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it should enter your mind </span>to say that Rav Yehuda said that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to all </span>the cases in the mishna, including that of the Ninth of Av that occurs on Shabbat eve, there is a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba raise a dilemma before Rav Yehuda </span>with regard to this issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he did not answer him? </span>This demonstrates that he did not have a decisive ruling on this subject.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to your opinion, </span>that the issue had not been resolved, there is a difficulty with <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra expounded in the name of Rav Huna: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">one fasts and completes </span>the fast on Shabbat eve. <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rabba </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">raise </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Huna, and he </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">did not answer him? </span>How could Mar Zutra have reported this halakhic ruling in the name of Rav Huna?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>you must say that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>dilemma that Rabba raised to Rav Huna was <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">heard </span>Rav’s ruling on the subject; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>i.e., Rav Huna’s statement as cited by Mar Zutra, was made <span class="gemarra-regular">after he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">heard </span>Rav’s ruling on the matter, and the problem was resolved for him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, too, </span>with regard to Rav Yehuda, we can say that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>dilemma that Rabba raised before Rav Yehuda was <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>Rav Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">heard </span>Rav’s ruling on the topic, and therefore he did not know how to answer Rabba; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>i.e., Rav Yehuda’s statement in the name of Rav, was made <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he heard it. </span>
The Gemara repeats the statement cited above in passing: <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra expounded in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the name of Rav Huna: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fasts and completes </span>the fast on the eves of Shabbat and Festivals.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one whom gentiles </span>forcibly <span class="gemarra-regular">took him ou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> beyond the Shabbat limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">an evil spiri</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> took him out, i.e., he was temporarily insane, and found himself outside the Shabbat limit, he <span class="gemarra-regular">has only four </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits </span>that he may walk from where he is standing.
If the gentiles <span class="gemarra-regular">returned him, </span>or if he came back while still under the influence of the evil spirit, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is as though he had never</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> left </span>his Shabbat limit, and he may move about within his original limit as before.
If the gentiles <span class="gemarra-regular">brought him to a different cit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> that was surrounded by walls, or if they <span class="gemarra-regular">put him into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a pen or a stable, </span>i.e., animal enclosures, the Sages disagree. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: He may walk </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire </span>city, as the whole city is considered like four cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Akiva say: He has only four cubits </span>from where he was placed. 
The mishna relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident where </span>all of these Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">were coming</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from Pelandarsin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> an overseas location, <span class="gemarra-regular">and their boat set</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sail on the se</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> on Shabbat, taking them beyond their Shabbat limit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya </span><span class="gemarra-regular">walked </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire </span>boat, as they hold that the entire boat is considered like four cubits, while <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi Akiva did not move beyond four cubits, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they sought to be stringent with themselves.</span>
The mishna further relates that on <span class="gemarra-regular">one occasion, they did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not enter the port [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">namel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until after nightfall </span>on Shabbat eve. The others <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rabban Gamliel: What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">alighting </span>from the boat at this time? In other words, were we already within the city’s limit before Shabbat commenced? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: You are permitted</span> to alight, <span class="gemarra-regular">as I was watching, and </span>I observed that <span class="gemarra-regular">we were </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">within the </span>city’s <span class="gemarra-regular">limit before nightfall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>We acquired our resting place in the city during the twilight period. Therefore, it is permitted to walk throughout the city even after nightfall. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Since the Gemara discussed one who stepped beyond the Shabbat limit due to an evil spirit, the Gemara cites a related <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, in which <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught: Three </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matters cause a person to act against his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the will of his Maker, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">they are: Gentiles, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and an evil spirit, and the depths of </span>extreme <span class="gemarra-regular">poverty.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span>practical halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>that emerges from this statement? The Gemara answers: It is significant as it teaches one <span class="gemarra-regular">to request mercy </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>people who suffer from those problems.
The Gemara cites a related teaching: <span class="gemarra-regular">Three</span> classes of people <span class="gemarra-regular">do not see the face of Gehenna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>because the suffering that they bear in this world atones for their sins, and <span class="gemarra-regular">they are: </span>Those suffering <span class="gemarra-regular">the depths</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>extreme <span class="gemarra-regular">poverty, </span>those afflicted <span class="gemarra-regular">with intestinal disease, and </span>those oppressed by <span class="gemarra-regular">creditors. And some say: Even one who has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an evil wife </span>who constantly harasses him.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>why don’t <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>Sages include one with an evil wife among those who will not be punished in Gehenna? The Gemara answers: They maintain that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a mitzva to divorce an evil wife. </span>Therefore, that source of distress can be remedied.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>why do <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>Sages include an evil wife? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sometimes </span>payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>very <span class="gemarra-regular">large, </span>and consequently he cannot divorce her since he cannot afford to pay it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, he has children </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from her, </span>and he cannot raise them himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot divorce her. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>practical halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>that emerges from this statement? The Gemara answers: It is significant as it teaches one <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accept </span>those afflictions <span class="gemarra-regular">with love, </span>knowing that they will exempt him from the punishment of Gehenna.
It was similarly taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">Three </span>classes of people are liable to <span class="gemarra-regular">die while conversing </span>with others, i.e., to die suddenly, although they appear to be in good health and are capable of engaging in conversation, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they are: Those </span>afflicted <span class="gemarra-regular">with intestinal sickness, and a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">woman </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in childbirth, and </span>one who is sick with <span class="gemarra-regular">edema</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hidrokan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
Once again the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span>practical halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>that emerges from this statement? The Gemara answers: It is significant as it teaches one <span class="gemarra-regular">to prepare shrouds for them, </span>in case they need them suddenly.
The Gemara proceeds to analyze the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one knowingly went out </span>beyond the Shabbat limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">only four cubits </span>that he may walk. The Gemara asks: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious. Now, </span>if with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one whom </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gentiles </span>forcibly <span class="gemarra-regular">took out </span>beyond the Shabbat limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only four cubits, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who knowingly </span><span class="gemarra-regular">went out, is it necessary </span>to teach that he has no more than four cubits within which he may walk?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say </span>that Rav Naḥman’s statement means: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he returned knowingl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> to within the Shabbat limit after having been taken out by gentiles, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has only four cubits </span>within which he may walk, but no more.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This, too, we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>from a precise reading of the mishna: If the gentiles <span class="gemarra-regular">returned him </span>to within the Shabbat limit <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as though he had never left </span>the Shabbat limit, and he may move about as before. By inference, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span> specifically when the gentiles themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">returned him that it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as though he never left </span>his Shabbat limit. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentiles took him out, and </span>then he <span class="gemarra-regular">returned knowingly </span>to his Shabbat limit, it is as though he left knowingly, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">has only four cubits </span>within which he may walk.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>Rav Naḥman’s statement as follows: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he knowingly </span><span class="gemarra-regular">went out </span>beyond the Shabbat limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">and was </span>later forcibly <span class="gemarra-regular">returne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by gentiles </span>to within his limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has only</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four cubits </span>that he may walk, although he was restored to within his limit against his will.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">This, too, we learned </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a precise reading of the mishna: If gentiles forcibly <span class="gemarra-regular">took him out and </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">returned him, it is as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">though he never left. </span>By inference, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>specifically when the gentiles themselves forcibly <span class="gemarra-regular">took him out and </span>then themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">returned him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is as though he never left </span>the Shabbat limit. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if he knowingly went out, no, </span>that is not the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, even if he was later forcibly returned by gentiles. 
The Gemara answers: Rav Naḥman’s statement is necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that perhaps the mishna is not referring to one specific case, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">it is teaching disjunctively</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., referring to two separate cases, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who was </span>forcibly <span class="gemarra-regular">taken out </span>beyond the Shabbat limit <span class="gemarra-regular">by gentiles and </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">returned knowingly has only four cubits </span>within which to walk. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he knowingly went out </span>beyond the Shabbat limit <span class="gemarra-regular">and was </span>later forcibly <span class="gemarra-regular">returned by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gentiles, it is as though he had never left, </span>and he may move within his original limit as before. Therefore, Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that if he willingly went out beyond the Shabbat limit and was later forcibly returned by gentiles, it is considered as though he had returned knowingly, so that he has only four cubits within which to walk.
<span class="gemarra-regular">They raised </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a dilemma before Rabba: </span>If a person who is restricted to an area of four cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">needed to relieve himself </span>and no secluded spot is available, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: </span>The Sages established a principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">great </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">human dignity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">supersedes a negative </span><span class="gemarra-regular">precept of the Torah, </span>and therefore a person is permitted to overstep the Shabbat limit fixed by the Sages in order to relieve himself modestly. 
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neharde’a said: If </span>this person <span class="gemarra-regular">is clever, he will enter </span>into his original Shabbat limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">and since he </span>was permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">entered, </span>and may remain there.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">produce that was taken ou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> beyond the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and was </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">returned, even if </span>this was done <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">has not lost its place; </span>rather, it may still be carried within the entire limit. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? It is that the produce did not go out willingly, but was taken <span class="gemarra-regular">due to circumstances </span><span class="gemarra-regular">beyond its control. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef bar Shemaya raised an objection to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov say: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is actually prohibited</span> to carry the produce beyond four cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> returned to its place unwittingly. </span>By inference, If it was returned <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly, yes, </span>it is permitted, but if it was returned <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not.</span>
The Gemara answers: This <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>subject to a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">produce that was taken out beyond the</span> Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, </span>if it was taken out <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly, it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may be eaten; </span>but if it was taken out <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it may not be eaten</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 

Daf 42a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya says: </span>If the produce was returned and is now <span class="gemarra-regular">in its </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">place, it may be eaten; </span>but if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in its </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">place, </span>i.e., if it is still beyond the Shabbat limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">it may not be eaten. </span>
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>meant by: <span class="gemarra-regular">In its place? If you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the produce was returned to <span class="gemarra-regular">its place intentionally, </span>there is a difficulty, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was explicitly taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is actually prohibited </span>to carry the produce beyond four cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless it was returned to its place unwittingly. </span>By inference, only if it was returned <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed </span>permitted, but if it was returned <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>does it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>mean that the produce was returned <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its place unwittingly, and </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete and it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teaches the following: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">produce that was taken</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out beyond the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, </span>if it was taken out <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly, it may be eaten; </span>but if it was taken out <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, it may not be eaten.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>In a case where the produce is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in its </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., it is still beyond the Shabbat limit. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if it was returned and is now <span class="gemarra-regular">in its </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">place, even </span>if it was returned <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, it may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be eaten. And Rabbi Neḥemya came to say: Even </span>if the produce was returned and is now <span class="gemarra-regular">in its </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">place, </span>a distinction applies. If it was returned <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly, yes, </span>it is permitted; but if it was returned <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not. </span>
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this is not necessarily the case, as the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> can also be explained as follows: If the produce was returned <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally to its place, everyone agrees, </span>i.e., both the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> and Rabbi Neḥemya, that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is forbidden. However, here they disagree with regard to </span>produce that was <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly </span>taken out beyond the Shabbat limit and was not returned, so that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">place. The first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that if the produce was taken out <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly, it is permitted </span>to be eaten, even if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in its </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">place. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the produce was taken out <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly, </span>if it was returned <span class="gemarra-regular">to its </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">place, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>permitted; but if it was not returned <span class="gemarra-regular">to its </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">place, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted. 
The Gemara objects to this reading: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, since the latter clause </span>of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: Actually, </span>carrying the produce beyond four cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unless it was returned to its place unwittingly, </span>and by inference, only if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly </span>returned is it <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed </span>permitted; however, if it was returned <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted. And since Rabbi Neḥemya maintains that produce that was intentionally returned to its place is forbidden, <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that even if it was returned <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, it is also permitted. </span>If so, the preceding explanation cannot be accepted, and the Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from here </span>that Rav Pappa’s opinion is supported by the opinion of the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> walking </span>in a certain place <span class="gemarra-regular">and does not know </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">the Shabbat limit </span>lies, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may take two thousand medium</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stride</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in each direction from the spot he acquired as his place of residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this is the Shabbat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">limit, </span>for a medium stride is approximately a cubit.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one established residence in a valley</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentiles surrounded </span>the entire area <span class="gemarra-regular">with a partitio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> for the purpose of residence <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat, he may walk </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in each direction, as he cannot rely on partitions that were not present when he acquired his place of residence. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may carry in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>partitioned area, as in any other private domain, even in the part that is beyond his two thousand cubits, but only <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of throwing, </span>as he himself cannot accompany the object past two thousand cubits.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: He may walk two thousand </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits; </span>however, even within this area <span class="gemarra-regular">he may carry </span>objects only a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits, </span>as in a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let him </span>be permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">carry in the entire </span>partitioned area <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of throwing. </span>Although he himself is limited in where he may walk, the partitions render it a private domain, and he should be permitted to carry in the entire area. 
The Gemara answers: The Sages prohibited this as a preventive measure, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest he be drawn after his object. </span>It is prohibited for him to leave the two thousand cubit limit, but were he permitted to carry by means of throwing, he might follow his object and go out beyond his permitted limit.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Within two thousand </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">at any rate, let him carry </span>the object <span class="gemarra-regular">in his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">usual manner. </span>Since he may traverse this area, there should be no concern that he might come to be drawn after the object.
The Gemara answers that this is prohibited due to another aspect of the laws of <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span>, namely <span class="gemarra-regular">because this is similar </span>to the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a partition that is breached in its entirety,</span> leaving the space open <span class="gemarra-regular">to a place into which it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is prohibited </span>to carry. Since he may not carry more than two thousand cubits, and the enclosed area is larger than two thousand cubits, the area that is permitted to him is breached in its entirety, left open to an area that is prohibited to him. Consequently, carrying is prohibited in the entire area, even by means of throwing.
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥiyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Rav said: </span>In that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may walk two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thousand cubits, and he may </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">carry </span>objects <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits. </span>The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with whose </span>opinion did Ḥiyya bar Rav issue his ruling? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">neither in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman, nor in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> while this dispute would appear to leave no place for a third opinion.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Read </span>Ḥiyya bar Rav’s ruling as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">He may carry </span>objects only a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>cubits. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, this is </span>the same as the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Huna. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Read </span>it then as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, Rabbi Ḥiyya bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Huna: Do not argue with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span>as cited by Rav Naḥman with regard to a field surrounded by a partition on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with his </span>opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: 

Daf 42b

If a person <span class="gemarra-regular">was measurin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> the two thousand cubits of his Shabbat limit from the spot where he deposited his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his measuring ended in the middle of the city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">he is permitted to carry throughout the city, provided that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he does not overstep the limit by foot, </span>i.e., that he does not walk beyond his permitted limit in the middle of the city. If he cannot walk about on foot, <span class="gemarra-regular">how can he carry </span>throughout the city? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not by means of throwing? </span>This presents a difficulty for Rav Huna, who prohibits carrying by means of throwing in a place where it is prohibited to walk. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: No, </span>it means that he may carry in the city <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of pulling, </span>i.e., he is permitted to pull objects from the other side of the city to the side where he is permitted to walk, for in this manner there is no concern that he might be drawn after the object, since he is bringing the object to him. 
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Huna said: </span>If a person <span class="gemarra-regular">was measuring </span>the two thousand cubits of his Shabbat limit from the spot where he deposited his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and his measuring ended in the middle </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a courtyard, he has only half the courtyard </span>in which to walk.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that he is not permitted to walk beyond his Shabbat limit. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Read </span>Rav Huna’s statement as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">He has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> half a courtyard, </span>i.e., Rav Huna addresses a different aspect of the issue; namely, he permits carrying in half the courtyard.
The Gemara asks: However, <span class="gemarra-regular">this too is obvious, </span>for why should it be prohibited for him to carry in a private domain where he is permitted to walk? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we should be concerned that </span>if he is permitted to carry in half the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">he might come to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">carry in the entire </span>courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Consequently, </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this concern is not taken into account.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">Huna agrees with me </span>that carrying is not prohibited in a comparable case, out of concern that the person be drawn after the object he is carrying: If a person <span class="gemarra-regular">was measuring </span>the two thousand cubits of his Shabbat limit from the spot where he deposited his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">measuring ended at the edge of the roo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f</span> of a house, most of which stood outside his Shabbat limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted to carry throughout the house </span>by means of throwing. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that Rav Huna agrees in this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because </span>the edge of <span class="gemarra-regular">the roof</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the house </span>is regarded as if it <span class="gemarra-regular">presses </span>down vertically at the end of his Shabbat limit, thus creating a partition, and so there is no concern that he might pass beyond this partition and be drawn after his object.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Huna, son of Rav Natan, said: </span>The dispute between Shmuel and Rav Huna is <span class="gemarra-regular">parallel to </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’im</span> recorded in the mishna: If the gentiles <span class="gemarra-regular">brought </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him to a different city </span>beyond his Shabbat limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if they put him in a pen or a stable, </span>the Sages disagree. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: He may walk about the entire </span>stable or pen. Since they are enclosed by a partition, their entire area is considered like only four cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Akiva say: He has only four cubits </span>from where he was deposited.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Is it not </span>the case that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Azarya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who said: He may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> walk about the entire </span>area, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not prohibit walking in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a pen or a stable due to walking in a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> field </span>where one is limited to four cubits? Rather, they say that since the stable is surrounded by partitions, it is not similar to a field, in which a person may not leave his four cubits.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And since they did not prohibit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> walking </span>in a pen or a stable <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the limits imposed on <span class="gemarra-regular">walking </span>in a field, <span class="gemarra-regular">they would </span>certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">not prohibit carrying </span>in a pen <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the limits imposed on <span class="gemarra-regular">walking </span>in a field. Rather, they would permit a person to carry in a field that had been enclosed on Shabbat by gentiles, and even to throw into the part lying beyond his two thousand cubits, parallel to the opinion of Shmuel who did not decree against this.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> is it not the case that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Akiva, who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he has only four cubits, prohibit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> walking in a pen or a stable due to </span>the limits imposed on <span class="gemarra-regular">walking in a field? And since they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibit walking </span>in a pen or a stable <span class="gemarra-regular">due to</span> the limits imposed on <span class="gemarra-regular">walking </span>in a field, <span class="gemarra-regular">they would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also prohibit carrying </span>past the two thousand cubit limit by means of throwing <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the limits imposed on <span class="gemarra-regular">walking</span> past there, in accordance with Rav Huna’s opinion.
The Gemara rejects this comparison: <span class="gemarra-regular">From what </span>do you infer that this is the case? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Azarya did not prohibit walking in a pen or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a stable due to </span>the limits imposed on <span class="gemarra-regular">walking in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a field, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">this applies </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">there, because they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two </span>distinct <span class="gemarra-regular">places. </span>In other words, the pen and stable are enclosed by partitions, while the field is not, and there is no reason to prohibit walking in one place out of concern that one might come to act improperly in a different place.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>as for the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying due to </span>the limits imposed on <span class="gemarra-regular">walking</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">one place, </span>might we <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>say <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>even Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya <span class="gemarra-regular">would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> decree </span>against carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">as a preventive measure, lest the person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be drawn after his object </span>and come to walk in a place prohibited to him.
The comparison can also be rejected from another angle: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Akiva too, from what </span>can it be inferred <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>they prohibit walking beyond four cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">due to a decree? Perhaps </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because they hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when we say that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the entire house is considered like four cubits, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">applies</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only where one acquired his place of residence within the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> airspace of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions </span>of the house <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> still day, </span>i.e., prior to the onset of Shabbat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, where he did not acquire his place of residence </span><span class="gemarra-regular">within the airspace of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions </span>of the house <span class="gemarra-regular">while </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was still day, </span>the house, and all the more so the stable or pen, is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered as four cubits; rather, it is measured based on the actual number of cubits it contains. Based on this explanation, this ruling indicates nothing with regard to the issue of throwing beyond the two-thousand cubit limit. Consequently, the Gemara rejects the link between the dispute of the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> in the mishna and that of Rav Naḥman and Rav Huna. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel with regard to a pen, a stable, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a boat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And Shmuel said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a boat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but not with regard to a stable</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a pen. </span>
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">At any rate, all agree, </span>i.e., both Rav and Shmuel, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel with regard to a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> boat. What is the reason </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is different in this case than in the other cases?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">since he acquired his place of residence within the partitions</span> of the boat <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day, </span>in which case it is reasonable to say that the entire boat is considered as if it is only four cubits.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">since the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> boat </span>constantly moves the person out of his four cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">lifting hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the beginning of four </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">placing him at the end of four </span>cubits. Since in any case he cannot restrict himself to any particular four cubits, even if he wished to do so, it is reasonable to say that he is permitted to walk about the entire boat. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>these two explanations? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them </span>with regard to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the walls of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the boat were breached, </span>so that the person is no longer located between its partitions. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>there is a difference <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the person <span class="gemarra-regular">jumped from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one boat to another, </span>so that he is no longer on the boat where he had acquired his place of residence. In both of these cases, Rabba’s reason no longer applies, but Rabbi Zeira’s reason does.
The Gemara asks: As for <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira, what is the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reason </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not state </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, </span>whose explanation is more straightforward? The Gemara answers: He could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sides </span>of a boat are not regarded as proper partitions, 

Daf 43a

for <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">made to keep the water out; </span>that is to say, a boat’s walls are not designed to turn it into a place of residence, but to protect it from the water. Therefore, they do not have the status of partitions made for the purpose of residence.
The Gemara asks: As for <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what is the reason he did not state </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span>a boat <span class="gemarra-regular">that is moving, all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> agree, </span>i.e., even Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva, that one is permitted to walk about the entire boat. <span class="gemarra-regular">They disagree </span>only with regard to a boat <span class="gemarra-regular">that is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stationary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rabban Gamliel holds that the boat’s walls constitute effective partitions, whereas Rabbi Yehoshua disagrees. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The mishna is also </span><span class="gemarra-regular">precise </span>in its implication <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to a moving </span>boat. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is this implied? <span class="gemarra-regular">From that which is taught: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident where </span>all of these Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">coming from Pelandarsin, and their boat set sail on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sea </span>on Shabbat, taking them out beyond their Shabbat limit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya walked </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> entire </span>boat, while <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not move beyond four cubits, as they sought to be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stringent with themselves.</span>
Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not disagree with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to a moving </span>boat, <span class="gemarra-regular">that is why it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>that they <span class="gemarra-regular">sought </span>to be stringent with themselves, i.e., they wished to practice stringency although they were under no obligation to do so, as they were concerned that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the boat <span class="gemarra-regular">will stand, </span>i.e., come to a stop. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree </span>even in the case of a boat that is moving, <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sought to be stringent, </span>is problematic, for the mishna should not refer to a desire to be stringent, as according to their opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">it is an </span>outright <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition.</span>
With regard to the previous issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: The mishna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is also precise, </span>implying this point in another manner as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">for it teaches </span>the law governing a boat <span class="gemarra-regular">parallel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the law governing <span class="gemarra-regular">a pen and a stable. Just</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as a pen and a stable are fixed </span>in their place, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>the mishna discusses <span class="gemarra-regular">a boat that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is fixed </span>in its place. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Rav and Shmuel both said that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with Rabban Gamliel with regard to a boat, </span>and if they had to decide <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>then this proves <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> about the issue. This is difficult, as the words: They wished to be stringent upon themselves, imply that there was no fundamental dispute at all.
Rav Ashi replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna’</span><span class="it-text">im</span> do in fact disagree about a boat that is standing. When the mishna says that Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva wished to be stringent upon themselves, implying that there is no real dispute, it is referring to a boat that is stationary. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya, son of Rabbi Yehoshua’s brother, says: All that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day </span>they spent on the boat, <span class="gemarra-regular">they sat and discussed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the matter of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>and come <span class="gemarra-regular">evening my father’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brother, </span>i.e., Rabbi Yehoshua, <span class="gemarra-regular">determined</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a </span>moving <span class="gemarra-regular">boat, </span>i.e., one is permitted to walk about all of it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a pen and a stable, </span>i.e., one may only walk four cubits in them, and the same applies to a stationary boat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥananya raised a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dilemma: Does </span>the prohibition of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">above ten</span> handbreadths from the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>perhaps does the prohibition of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits not </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">above ten </span>handbreadths? In other words, does the Shabbat limit apply only close to the ground, in which case walking more than ten handbreadths above the ground, would be permitted?
The Gemara clarifies the case in which this dilemma arises: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a post</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high and four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide, </span>partly within the limit and partly outside of it, this case <span class="gemarra-regular">should not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be a dilemma for you. </span>Such a stable post <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">solid ground, </span>although it differs from the surrounding area in height; therefore, it is prohibited to walk from the part within the limit to the part outside of it.
The case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">should be a dilemma for you </span>is that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> post ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high but not four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide, </span>or the like. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>the case is one <span class="gemarra-regular">where he advances</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by way of a lea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> in the air above ten handbreadths from the ground.
The Gemara presents <span class="gemarra-regular">another version </span>of the previous dilemma: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a boat </span>sailing on the surface of the water more than ten handbreadths from the sea or river bed? Does the prohibition of Shabbat limits apply or not? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Hoshaya said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to this dilemma from what was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">It once happened</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>all of these Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">were coming from Pelandarsin, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their boat set sail on the sea, etc. Granted, if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you say </span>that the prohibition of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits applies </span>above ten handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is why </span>Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">sought </span>to be stringent. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if you say </span>that the prohibition of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits </span>does not apply above ten handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">why did they seek </span>to be stringent?
The Gemara answers: It may be suggested <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>with regard to a parallel case, establishing that case as one where the boat was <span class="gemarra-regular">moving through </span>shallow, <span class="gemarra-regular">swampy water; here, too, </span>we are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the boat <span class="gemarra-regular">was moving through </span>shallow, <span class="gemarra-regular">swampy water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span>within ten handbreadths of the sea’s bed, so that the prohibition of Shabbat limits certainly applies.
The Gemara cites another proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution from the mishna: On <span class="gemarra-regular">one occasion</span> on a Shabbat eve, <span class="gemarra-regular">they did not enter the port</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until after nightfall, etc. Granted, if you say </span>that the prohibition of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits </span>applies above ten handbreadths, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>that they asked whether or not they may disembark. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if you say </span>that the prohibition of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not apply </span>above ten handbreadths, even if Rabban Gamliel had told them: <span class="gemarra-regular">We were not within the </span>city’s <span class="gemarra-regular">limit </span>before nightfall, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">would it </span>have made? They could have alighted from the boat, for the boat was above ten handbreadths, where the prohibition of Shabbat limits does not apply. 
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The mishna refers to a case where the boat was <span class="gemarra-regular">moving through </span>shallow, <span class="gemarra-regular">swampy water </span>within ten handbreadths of the sea’s bed. 
The Gemara cites another proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution from the incident involving <span class="gemarra-regular">the seven teaching</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">said on Shabbat morning before Rav Ḥisda in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sura </span>and then repeated <span class="gemarra-regular">toward the conclusion of </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before Rava in Pumbedita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> despite the fact that the distance between them is too great for someone to have traversed it on Shabbat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>those teachings, and delivered them from one place to the other? Was it <span class="gemarra-regular">not Elijah </span>the Prophet,who traveled from Sura to Pumbedita by way of a miraculous leap through the air above ten handbreadths from the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">who said them? Apparently, </span>the prohibition of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not apply above ten </span>handbreadths, for Elijah would not have transgressed this prohibition. The Gemara rejects this argument: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>proof; <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps Yosef the demon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who does not observe Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">reported these </span>teachings and brought them from Sura to Pumbedita.
The Gemara attempts to bring a different proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>that which was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to one who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will be a nazirite </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on the day that the son of David comes, </span>i.e., upon the arrival of the Messiah, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is permitted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to drink wine on Shabbat and Festivals, </span>for the Messiah will not arrive on one of those days. 

Daf 43b

<span class="gemarra-regular">However, he is prohibited </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to drink wine on all weekdays, </span>in case the Messiah has come and he has not yet been informed.
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say that </span>the prohibition of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits applies </span>above ten handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">that is </span>why <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat and Festivals he is permitted </span>to drink wine, for the Messiah will certainly not arrive from outside the Shabbat limit on those days. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say that</span> the prohibition of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits does not apply </span>above ten handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">why is he permitted </span>to drink wine <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Festivals? </span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is different there, as the verse stated: “Behold I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will send you Elijah the prophet, </span>before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord; and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers” (Malachi 3:23–24). This verse teaches that Elijah will arrive the day before the coming of the Messiah. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since Elijah did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> come the previous day, </span>the Messiah will not come today, and therefore he may drink.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, on weekdays, too, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he should be permitted </span>to drink wine <span class="gemarra-regular">each and every </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day, as Elijah did not arrive the previous day. Rather, </span>the reason for the prohibition on weekdays must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>that Elijah may already have <span class="gemarra-regular">arrived at the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Great Court, </span>but it has not yet become a matter of public knowledge. Likewise, <span class="gemarra-regular">here too we should say </span>that Elijah already <span class="gemarra-regular">arrived </span>the previous day <span class="gemarra-regular">at the Great Court,</span> on the eve of Shabbat or a Festival. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It has already been promised to the Jewish people that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Elijah will not come either on the eve of Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or on the eve of a Festival, due to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> trouble, </span>lest people go out to greet him and not have time to complete all their preparations for the sacred day.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">It might enter your mind</span> to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">since Elijah will not come </span>on Shabbat eve due to the trouble involved, the <span class="gemarra-regular">Messiah will also</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not come </span>then, and if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat eve </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he should </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">be permitted </span>to drink wine. However, this reasoning is rejected: It is only <span class="gemarra-regular">Elijah </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">will not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">arrive </span>on Shabbat eve, but the <span class="gemarra-regular">Messiah </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">may arrive, </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">once the Messiah comes, all </span>the nations <span class="gemarra-regular">will be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">subservient to the Jewish people, </span>and they will help them prepare whatever is needed for Shabbat.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">He should be permitted </span>to drink wine <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Sunday, </span>for if Elijah cannot come on Shabbat, the Messiah will not come on a Sunday. <span class="gemarra-regular">Let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us resolve from here </span>that the prohibition of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not apply </span>above ten handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">as if </span>the prohibition of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits applies </span>above ten handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">on Sunday he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should be permitted </span>to drink wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Elijah cannot come</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was uncertain whether there is</span> a prohibition of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits </span>above ten handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>prohibition of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits. </span>Therefore, he ruled <span class="gemarra-regular">stringently </span>in this regard concerning Sunday. 
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">When did </span>the person who took the vow of naziriteship <span class="gemarra-regular">arise </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">take</span> his <span class="gemarra-regular">vow? If you say he arose </span>and took his vow <span class="gemarra-regular">on a weekday, since </span>the vow of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">took effect, how can Shabbat come and annul it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Naziriteship cannot take effect one day and be annulled on the next; rather, once it applies, it remains in effect for the entire period of his vow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">he arose</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat and took </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">vow, or </span>else he arose <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival and took </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">vow, and </span>it is only on <span class="gemarra-regular">that day that he is permitted </span>to drink wine, as the Messiah will not come; but <span class="gemarra-regular">from that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day on he is prohibited </span>to drink wine, for once the naziriteship takes effect on a weekday, it remains in effect from that point onwards, even on Shabbat and Festivals.
It was taught in the mishna: On <span class="gemarra-regular">one occasion, they did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not enter the por</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> until after nightfall on Shabbat eve, and they asked Rabban Gamliel whether they were permitted to alight from the boat. He told them that they were permitted to alight, for he had been watching, and he knew that they had entered within the city’s limit before nightfall, and therefore they may walk throughout the city. 
In order to clarify this issue, the Gemara cites that which was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gamliel had a </span>special <span class="gemarra-regular">tub</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> through which he would look</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and see </span>a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits on land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>also determine <span class="gemarra-regular">a corresponding </span>distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at sea.</span>
In general, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who wishes to know the depth of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> valle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> can bring </span>such <span class="gemarra-regular">a tube and look through </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it, and he will know the depth of the valley.</span>
The Gemara cites another statement with regard to measurements: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who wishes to know the height of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">palm tree, </span>but does not want to actually climb the tree to measure it, <span class="gemarra-regular">can measure his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">height, and </span>the length of <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">shadow, and </span>the length of <span class="gemarra-regular">the shadow of the height </span>of the palm tree, and calculate the proportions, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he will know the height of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the palm tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara cites related advice: If, out of honor for the dead, <span class="gemarra-regular">one wishes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that a wild beast should not rest in the shade</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a grave, he should insert a reed </span>into the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span>the end of <span class="gemarra-regular">the fourth hour of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day, </span>roughly ten o’clock in the morning, when it is hot in the sun and cooler in the shade, and beasts begin to seek shelter in the shade. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> he should <span class="gemarra-regular">observe in which direction the shadow </span>of the reed <span class="gemarra-regular">inclines, </span>and then <span class="gemarra-regular">slant </span>the gravestone <span class="gemarra-regular">upwards and downwards</span> until he finds an angle at which it casts no shadow at that hour, and the beasts will not come to rest at the grave during the heat of the day.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Neḥemya, son of Rav Ḥanilai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, was </span>once so <span class="gemarra-regular">engrossed in </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">learning </span>that he did not notice that <span class="gemarra-regular">he was going out beyond </span>his Shabbat limit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Naḥman: Your student Neḥemya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in distress, </span>as he is outside the Shabbat limit and cannot enter. What can we do for him?
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Establish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a human partition for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., people who are permitted to go out there should line up and form human walls, through which he is permitted to walk and thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">reenter </span>the Shabbat limit.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak sat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> behind Rava, and Rava sat </span>in the first row <span class="gemarra-regular">before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Naḥman. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rava: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">was Rav Ḥisda’s dilemma </span>that he addressed to Rav Naḥman with regard to Neḥemya’s distress? 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a case where the space between Neḥemya and the Shabbat limit could be <span class="gemarra-regular">filled with people </span>who had established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> and were permitted to go out beyond the Shabbat limit and establish a human partition for Neḥemya, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then it can be argued that <span class="gemarra-regular">the dilemma </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">raised </span>was: Is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel </span>that a person may walk throughout an enclosed area, although he had not established residence there before Shabbat while it was still day, and the same applies to a human partition of this kind; 

Daf 44a

<span class="gemarra-regular">or is </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel? Or perhaps we are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dealing with </span>a case where the space between Neḥemya and the Shabbat limit could <span class="gemarra-regular">not be filled with people </span>who had established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> and were permitted to establish a human partition for Neḥemya. In that case, there were enough people to establish partitions from where Neḥemya was standing to within two cubits from the limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the dilemma that Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">raised </span>was: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, </span>who says that someone who went two cubits outside of his Shabbat limit may reenter it, <span class="gemarra-regular">or is </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious that we are dealing with </span>a case where the space between Neḥemya and the Shabbat limit could <span class="gemarra-regular">not be filled with people, as if it should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enter your mind that we are dealing with </span>a case where the space between Neḥemya and the Shabbat limit could be fully <span class="gemarra-regular">filled with people, what is </span>Rav Ḥisda’s <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma? Didn’t Rav say: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel with regard to a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pen, a stable, and a boat? Rather, we </span>must be <span class="gemarra-regular">dealing with </span>a case where the space between Neḥemya and the Shabbat limit could <span class="gemarra-regular">not be filled with people, and</span> the dilemma that <span class="gemarra-regular">he raised was </span>about the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Eliezer.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>interpretation is <span class="gemarra-regular">also precise </span>and implicit in Rav Naḥman’s answer, <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Ḥisda: Establish a human partition for him, and <span class="gemarra-regular">let him reenter </span>his Shabbat limit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t </span>the statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him reenter, </span>mean that he may reenter even <span class="gemarra-regular">without a partition </span>along those two additional two cubits, i.e., that after he passes through the human partitions, he would still need to cross the remaining two cubits on his own without the benefit of a partition?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak raised an objection to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>with regard to the principle of making a human partition on Shabbat, from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the wall </span>of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">fell </span>on a Festival or on Shabbat, thus rendering the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> unfit for the mitzva, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not position people, animals or utensils there </span>in its place in order to form a wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one turn a bed upright in order to spread a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sheet over it, </span>which will thereby serve as a partition, <span class="gemarra-regular">because one may not make a temporary tent for the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first </span>time <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival, and, needless to say, </span>this is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat. </span>This indicates that a human partition may not be erected on Shabbat. 
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You state</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to me </span>that this is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">state to you </span>that it is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>other <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may position his fellow as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a wall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so that he may eat, drink, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sleep </span>in a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he is likewise permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">turn a bed upright </span>in order to <span class="gemarra-regular">spread a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sheet over it, so that the sun should not beat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">down on a corpse, or on food.</span>
The Gemara comments: If so, these two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">contradict one another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult; this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that teaches that it is prohibited reflects the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>other <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that teaches that it is permitted reflects the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. As we learned </span>in a mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a window shutte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> that is not fixed to the wall with hinges, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is tied </span>to the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">and hangs </span>from the window, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may shut </span>the window <span class="gemarra-regular">with it; but if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not, one may not shut </span>the window <span class="gemarra-regular">with it, </span>since one may not erect a tent, even a temporary one, on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Rabbis say: In either case, one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may shut </span>the window <span class="gemarra-regular">with it. </span>This indicates that the Rabbis permit constructing a temporary wall of this sort on Shabbat, and they also permit the construction of a temporary wall in the case of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated with regard to this </span>dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: All agree that one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not make a temporary ten</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the first </span>time <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival, and, needless to say, </span>this is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat. </span>The Rabbis and Rabbi Eliezer <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree only with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to adding </span>a temporary tent to a permanent structure, as in the case of a window shutter. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eliezer says: One may not add </span>a temporary tent to a permanent structure even <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival; and, needless to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say, </span>this is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat. And the Rabbis </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: One may add </span>a temporary tent to a permanent structure <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat, and needless to say, </span>this is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival. </span>This indicates that there is no opinion that grants license to construct a temporary wall for the first time.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Gemara resolves the contradiction differently: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that permits the positioning of an animal or a person as a wall was taught <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that prohibits it was taught <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who positions an animal </span>to serve <span class="gemarra-regular">as the wall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Meir deems it unfit, </span>out of concern that the animal might leave, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> deems it fit. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Meir, who deems </span>the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">unfit there, </span>with regard to a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">apparently </span>holds that a partition established from a living creature <span class="gemarra-regular">is not a partition </span>and he would <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of Shabbat, rule that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to construct such a wall, as <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not doing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">anything, </span>since it is not considered actual construction.
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who deems </span>the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be fit there, </span>with regard to a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">apparently </span>holds that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is a </span>proper <span class="gemarra-regular">partition; </span>and he would <span class="gemarra-regular">here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in the case of Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibit </span>the construction of such a partition.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> how can <span class="gemarra-regular">you understand </span>it in that manner? <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you heard that Rabbi Meir </span>deemed the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> to be unfit in the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal </span>was used to serve as a partition, but <span class="gemarra-regular">did you hear </span>that he deemed the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> to be similarly unfit if <span class="gemarra-regular">a person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or utensils </span>were used as walls? The reason that an animal may not be used as a partition, according to his opinion, is because it might leave. This concern does not apply to people or utensils, since a person is under his own control and can remain standing, and utensils do not move themselves. Since the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> validates partitions established with people and utensils as well as animals, it cannot be based on the opinion of Rabbi Meir. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">furthermore, </span>even if you do not differentiate as above, and instead assume that the consideration that the animal might leave is pertinent, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to whose </span>opinion does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir </span>state his opinion with regard to constructing a temporary tent on Shabbat? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of his teacher <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, </span>this is difficult, as <span class="gemarra-regular">he even prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> adding </span>a window shutter, i.e., a temporary tent, to a permanent structure. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>you must say that he stated his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. </span>However, even according to their opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">say that the Rabbis </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that one is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to add </span>a temporary tent to a permanent structure; but <span class="gemarra-regular">did they say that </span>it is permitted to construct a partition or a tent <span class="gemarra-regular">for the first time?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>say that both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> follow the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>and this is the resolution of the various contradictions: With regard to the contradiction between the one ruling concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">utensils </span>and the other ruling concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">utensils, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ruling that prohibits the construction of an additional wall refers <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">third wall </span>of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, which renders it fit for the mitzva; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>other ruling that permits the construction of an additional wall refers <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourth wall </span>of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, which is insignificant, as a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> need not have four walls. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>interpretation <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise </span>in the wording of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that prohibits the construction of an additional wall uses the following phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">If its wall fell</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This indicates a wall that is significant, i.e., a wall that renders it fit for use, rather than any wall, as stated in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that permits it. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from this </span>that the correct resolution is to differentiate between the third and fourth wall of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>. 

Daf 44b

<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to the contradiction between the one ruling concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>and the other ruling concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>for one <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that one may not use a person as the wall of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, while the other says that one may use a person as a wall and even states explicitly that he may do this: So that he may eat, drink and sleep in the <span class="it-text">sukka</span>. That implies that this is permitted even if it is the third wall that is missing.
The Gemara answers: With regard to the contradiction between the one ruling concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>and the other ruling concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a person, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">also not difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Here, </span>where it is prohibited, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> refers to a case where that person <span class="gemarra-regular">knowingly </span>served as a partition; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>where it is permitted, it refers to a case where that person <span class="gemarra-regular">unknowingl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> served as a partition, which is not the usual manner of building. This is not the case with regard to utilizing a utensil as a partition. Since the utensil lacks knowledge, it is considered a partition regardless of how it is placed, and it is prohibited in all cases.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>the case involving <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya, son of Rabbi Ḥanilai, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>a case where people <span class="gemarra-regular">knowingly </span>served as a partition, as the people were instructed to go out and serve as a human partition. The Gemara answers: In fact, that <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>a case where people <span class="gemarra-regular">unknowingly </span>served as a partition, i.e., they were unaware why they were called, and were made into a partition without their knowledge.
The Gemara asks: However, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda, </span>who gathered the people to that spot, <span class="gemarra-regular">was in any case</span> present <span class="gemarra-regular">knowingly. </span>The Gemara answers: While <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda </span>was there knowingly, he <span class="gemarra-regular">was not among the designated </span>people who served as a partition.
The Gemara relates that there were <span class="gemarra-regular">these members of a wedding </span>party who engaged the many people present <span class="gemarra-regular">to bring water in </span>on Shabbat from a public domain to a private domain <span class="gemarra-regular">through walls comprised of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> people </span>who knew that they were being used as partitions for that purpose. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span>instructed that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">be flogged</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. He said </span>with regard to this matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that a partition is effective when the people act <span class="gemarra-regular">unknowingly, </span>does this mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">they would </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that this is permitted <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span> when they <span class="gemarra-regular">knowingly </span>serve as a partition?
The Gemara relates that there <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">these flasks</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lying in the market [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ristaka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Meḥoza </span>on Shabbat and could not be moved. <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rava was coming from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his discourse </span>accompanied by a throng of people, his attendants <span class="gemarra-regular">brought </span>the flasks <span class="gemarra-regular">into his </span>house, as the crowd of people created human partitions, upon which the attendants capitalized for this purpose. <span class="gemarra-regular">On another Shabbat they wanted to bring </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them in </span>again, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited them </span>from doing so, reasoning: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is like </span>the case where the people <span class="gemarra-regular">knowingly </span>served as partitions, for presumably the people now knew that they were being used for this purpose, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara further relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Levi was brought straw </span>through human partitions comprised of people who were unknowingly used for this purpose, and in the same manner <span class="gemarra-regular">Ze’eiri </span>was brought <span class="gemarra-regular">fodder [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aspasta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya </span>was brought <span class="gemarra-regular">water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who was permitted to leave </span>his Shabbat limit, i.e., he went out to testify that he had seen the new moon or for some life-saving purpose, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they said to him </span>along the way: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">action has already been performed, </span>and there is no need for you to travel for that purpose, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thousand cubits in each direction </span>from the location where he was standing when this was told to him. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">If he was within </span>his original <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, </span>it is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as if he had not left </span>his limit, and he may return to his original location. The Sages formulated a principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">All who go out to </span>battle and <span class="gemarra-regular">save </span>lives <span class="gemarra-regular">may return to their </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">locations </span>on Shabbat.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of the statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he was within </span>his original <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as if he had never left? </span>Given that he has not left his original boundary, it is clear that he remains within his original limit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying as follows: If he was within his </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as if he had never left </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his house. </span>He is allowed to walk two thousand cubits in each direction from his house.
The Gemara asks: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious</span> that if he remained within his limit, he is considered as if he were in his house. Why is this statement necessary? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that, <span class="gemarra-regular">since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he moved </span>from his place with intention to leave his limit and go elsewhere, <span class="gemarra-regular">he moved </span>and nullified his original place of residence. If so, his original place of residence would no longer determine his Shabbat limit, and instead he would have two thousand cubits in each direction from the location where he was standing when he was told that he need not travel. Therefore, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that it is nonetheless considered as if he had never left his house.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shimi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Ḥiyya said </span>that the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">saying as follows: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he left his original Shabbat limit, but <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>new <span class="gemarra-regular">limit </span>of two thousand cubits in each direction <span class="gemarra-regular">that the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sages granted him is subsumed within his </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, </span>so that if he walks those two thousand cubits, he can return to within his original limit, then <span class="gemarra-regular">it is as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if he had never left his </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, </span>and he may return to his house. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>Rabba and Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rav Shimi, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the subsuming of </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits, </span>i.e., if one’s original limit is subsumed within the new limit, one may pass from one to the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">is something </span>significant and may be relied upon, whereas this <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabba, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is nothing </span>significant and cannot be relied upon.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rabba: Do you not hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the subsuming </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits is something </span>significant? <span class="gemarra-regular">And what if he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">established residence in a cav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that has entrances at its two ends, which <span class="gemarra-regular">on the inside </span>of the cave <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four thousand </span>cubits across, <span class="gemarra-regular">but atop its roof </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> less than four thousand cubits </span>across? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the case that he may walk the entire </span>length of the roof <span class="gemarra-regular">and two thousand cubits outside it </span>in either direction? The entire interior of the cave is considered as if it were four cubits, and he is permitted to walk another two thousand cubits in each direction from each of its entrances. Consequently, he is permitted to walk along the roof, two thousand cubits from the eastern entrance in the direction of the western entrance and vice versa. However, since the distance across the roof is less than four thousand cubits, these two limits are subsumed within one another, and he is permitted to walk the entire length of the roof, given that when two limits are subsumed within one another, one may pass from one to the other.
Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you not distinguish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> between </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the person <span class="gemarra-regular">established residence within the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> airspace of partitions </span>before Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as in the case of the cave, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did not establish residence within the airspace </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of partitions </span>before Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day, </span>as in the case of the mishna? The principle governing the Shabbat limits being subsumed in one another only applies in the former case, where both of the Shabbat limits were established before Shabbat, but not in the latter case, where the two limits were established at different times, one before Shabbat and one on Shabbat.
Abaye raised a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did not acquire</span> his place of residence within those partitions before Shabbat, does the principle governing the subsuming of limits <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>apply? 

Daf 45a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>If a person left his Shabbat limit by walking <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>cubits beyond it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reenter </span>his original limit; but if he left his Shabbat limit by walking <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>cubits beyond it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reenter. What, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not that Rabbi Eliezer follows his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, in </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>with regard to the four cubits a person is allotted wherever he is, he is set <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle of them, </span>i.e., he may walk two cubits in each direction?
The Gemara explains that <span class="gemarra-regular">the four cubits that the Sages gave </span>a person <span class="gemarra-regular">are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regarded </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">as being subsumed </span>within his original limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> it is for this reason that <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: He may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reenter </span>his original limit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently </span>he is of the opinion that <span class="gemarra-regular">the subsuming of </span>one Shabbat limit within another <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> something </span>significant. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Ḥana said to Abaye: Do you raise an objection </span><span class="gemarra-regular">against our Master, </span>Rabba, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer? </span>But isn’t the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer? Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Yes, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I heard from our Master </span>himself that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis disagree </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with Rabbi Eliezer only </span>with regard to one who went beyond his limit <span class="gemarra-regular">for a voluntary matter, but </span>with regard to one who went out <span class="gemarra-regular">for a mitzva matter, they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">agree with him </span>about the subsuming of limits, i.e., that if one limit is subsumed in another, it is permitted to pass between them. This demonstrates that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> recognizes the principle of the subsuming of limits. 
The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">All who go out to save </span>lives <span class="gemarra-regular">may return to their </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">locations </span>on Shabbat. The Gemara asks: Does this mean that he may return to his original place <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if he went out <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>than two thousand cubits beyond his limit? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first clause say </span>that a person who was permitted to travel beyond his Shabbat limit is allotted <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and no more?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>What this means is <span class="gemarra-regular">that they may return with </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">weapons to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">locations, </span>provided they are within two thousand cubits. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the difficulty </span>with returning home in this situation? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>in the case where people went out <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>fight and <span class="gemarra-regular">save </span>lives the law <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and they are allowed to go home even if they went more than two thousand cubits beyond the limit. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a difficulty, this is the difficulty: As we learned </span>in a mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Rosh</span> <span class="it-text">HaShana</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">at first </span>they would take the witnesses who had come to Jerusalem from a distant place on Shabbat to testify that they had seen the new moon, and bring them into a special courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they would not move from there the entire day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This was in accordance with the law governing one who was permitted to go out beyond his limit, as once he fulfilled his mission, he was no longer permitted to move beyond four cubits.
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel the Elder instituted that they </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">have two thousand cubits in each direction, </span>so that witnesses not refrain from coming to testify. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not only these </span>whom the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>are given two thousand cubits in the place that they have reached, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">even a midwife who comes to deliver </span>a child, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one who comes to rescue </span>Jews <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>an invasion of gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">troops or from a river or a collapsed building</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a fire; they are like the inhabitants of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> town </span>at which they arrive, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they have two thousand</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits in each direction.</span>
The question may be raised: Are they given <span class="gemarra-regular">no more </span>than two thousand cubits? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it say </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">All who go out to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">save </span>lives <span class="gemarra-regular">may return to their </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">locations </span>on Shabbat, which indicates that they may walk <span class="gemarra-regular">even more </span>than two thousand cubits?
In response, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>We must not infer from the mishna that they may go home even if they went out more than two thousand cubits from their limit, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">that they may return with </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">weapon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to their </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">locations, </span>provided that they are within two thousand cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">At first </span>those returning from a rescue mission <span class="gemarra-regular">would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place their weapons in </span>the first house that they encountered upon their return, i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">the house nearest the wall, </span>to avoid carrying on Shabbat any more than necessary.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Once, </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">enemies </span><span class="gemarra-regular">noticed that they </span>were no longer carrying their weapons, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">chased after them; and </span>the defenders <span class="gemarra-regular">entered </span>the house <span class="gemarra-regular">to take up their weapons </span>and fight, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">enemies </span><span class="gemarra-regular">entered after them, </span>causing great confusion. In the chaos, the defenders began to <span class="gemarra-regular">push one another, and </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">killed more </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of each other than </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">enemies killed </span>of them. <span class="gemarra-regular">At </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that time </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted that they should return to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their locations, </span>i.e., their destinations, <span class="gemarra-regular">with their weapons. </span>
The Gemara cites an alternate resolution that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in the mishna in <span class="it-text">Rosh</span> <span class="it-text">HaShana</span> where they only permitted two thousand cubits, it is referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Jews defeated the nations of the world, </span>i.e., the gentiles, in battle; in such a case there is no concern and they need not return to their original locations. Whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the mishna which indicates that the Sages permitted even more than two thousand cubits, it is referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where the nations of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> world defeated themselves, </span>i.e., the Jews, whom the Gemara refers to euphemistically as themselves; in such a case the Sages allowed the defeated soldiers to return to their original locations.
Since the Gemara discussed war on Shabbat, the Gemara cites <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">gentiles </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who besieged Jewish towns, they may not go out </span>to fight <span class="gemarra-regular">against them with their weapons, nor may they desecrate </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>in any other way <span class="gemarra-regular">due to them, </span>but rather they must wait until after Shabbat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">That was also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, with a caveat: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">gentiles</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who besieged, etc. In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this said? </span>It is said in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the gentiles <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>and besieged the town <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to monetary matters, </span>i.e., banditry. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if they came with regard to lives, </span>i.e., there is concern that the gentiles will attack, <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may go out against them with their weapons, and they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may desecrate Shabbat due to them.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And with regard to a town</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is </span>located <span class="gemarra-regular">near the border, even if </span>the gentiles <span class="gemarra-regular">did not come with regard to lives, but </span>rather <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to matters of hay and straw, </span>i.e., to raid and spoil the town, <span class="gemarra-regular">they may go out against</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them with their weapons, and they may desecrate Shabbat due</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to them, </span>as the border must be carefully guarded, in order to prevent enemies from gaining a foothold there.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Manyumi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: And Babylonia is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">considered like a town </span>located <span class="gemarra-regular">near the border, </span>and war may be waged there on Shabbat even if the gentiles came for financial gain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this means </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Neharde’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which was located near the border.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dostai </span>of the town <span class="gemarra-regular">of Biri expounded: What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “And they told David, saying: Behold, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Philistines are fighting against Ke’ila</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they rob </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the threshing floors” </span>(i Samuel 23:1), after which David asked God how he should respond.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ke’ila was a town </span>located <span class="gemarra-regular">near the border, </span>and the Philistines <span class="gemarra-regular">came only with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to matters of hay and straw, as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written: “And they rob the threshing floors.” And </span>in the next verse <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “Therefore David inquired of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lord, saying: Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Lord said to David: Go and smite the Philistines, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and save Ke’ila” </span>(i Samuel 23:2), which indicates that war may be waged in a border town on Shabbat, even with regard to monetary matters.
The Gemara refutes this proof by asking: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>David’s <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma? If you say </span>that he had a halakhic question and was in doubt <span class="gemarra-regular">whether it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted or prohibited </span>to fight the Philistines on Shabbat, it is possible to respond: <span class="gemarra-regular">But the court of Samuel from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rama was </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">in existence, </span>and rather than inquire by way of the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span> he should have inquired of the Great Sanhedrin.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>he asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">Will he succeed or will he not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> succeed </span>in his war? The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is also</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> precise </span>in the language of the verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written </span>in the response to David’s query: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Go </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and smite the Philistines, and save Ke’ila.” Learn from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>from the assurance that God gave David of his victory, that this was the subject of his inquiry.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person who was sitting along the road </span>on Shabbat eve toward nightfall, unaware that he was within the city’s Shabbat limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">he stood up </span>after Shabbat had already commenced, <span class="gemarra-regular">he saw that he was near the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">town, </span>i.e., within its limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">since he had not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">intended </span>to acquire his place of residence in the town, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not enter </span>it, but rather he measures two thousand cubits from his place; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: He may enter </span>the town. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: It once happened that Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Tarfon entered </span>a town on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">without intention </span>from the beginning of Shabbat to establish residence in the city.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: It once happened that Rabbi Tarfon was walking along</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the way </span>on Shabbat eve, <span class="gemarra-regular">and night fell upon him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and he spent the night outside the town. In the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> morning, cowherds </span>who came to graze their cattle outside the town <span class="gemarra-regular">found him </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Master, the town</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is before you; enter. He entered and sat in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> study hall and taught the entire day. </span>This indicates that one is permitted to enter.
The other Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Yehuda: Do you bring <span class="gemarra-regular">proof </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from there? Perhaps he had it in mind </span>the day before to acquire residence in the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">study hall was subsumed within his </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If the study hall was within two thousand cubits of the spot where he established residence, all agree that he may enter there.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who was sleeping along the road </span>on Shabbat eve <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not know that night had fallen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">he has two thousand cubits in each direction; </span>this is the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, </span>who maintains that knowledge and awareness are not necessary for one to acquire residence, but rather, a person’s presence in a given location establishes residence there.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: He has only four cubits, </span>as since he did not knowingly acquire residence, he did not establish a Shabbat limit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>He has only four cubits total <span class="gemarra-regular">and he is in the middle of them, </span>i.e., he has two cubits in each direction. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: He may walk </span>four cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">in any direction he wishes. But Rabbi Yehuda agrees that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if he selected for himself </span>the direction in which he wants to walk those four cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">he cannot retract </span>and walk four cubits in a different direction.
With regard to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were two </span>people in this situation, positioned in such a way that <span class="gemarra-regular">part </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>four <span class="gemarra-regular">cubits of on</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">were subsumed within the </span>four <span class="gemarra-regular">cubits of the other, they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">bring </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">and eat </span>together in the shared area <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle, </span>

Daf 45b

<span class="gemarra-regular">provided that the one does not carry </span>anything <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his </span>four-cubit limit <span class="gemarra-regular">into that of his fellow.</span>
With regard to a case where there <span class="gemarra-regular">were three </span>people in this situation, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>certain parts of the four cubits of <span class="gemarra-regular">the middle one were subsumed within </span>the respective limits of each of <span class="gemarra-regular">the others, </span>so that he shared a certain area with each of them, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is permitted </span>to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>either of <span class="gemarra-regular">them, and they are </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">with him; but the two outer ones are forbidden</span> to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">with each other, </span>since they share no common area. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon said: To</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is this comparable? </span>It is like <span class="gemarra-regular">three courtyards that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> open into one another, and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">open into a public</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> domain. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the two outer </span>courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the middle one, </span>the middle one <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to </span>carry to the two outer ones, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they are permitted to</span> carry to <span class="gemarra-regular">it, but the two outer </span>courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited</span> to carry from <span class="gemarra-regular">one to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">other, </span>as they did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with one another.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a dilemma: What does Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri hold? </span>Does <span class="gemarra-regular">he hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless objects acquire residence </span>for Shabbat, i.e., even an article that does not belong to anyone acquires residence at the onset of Shabbat and can therefore be carried two thousand cubits in each direction?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to this understanding, Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri <span class="gemarra-regular">should by right </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have disagreed </span>with the Rabbis even <span class="gemarra-regular">about utensils </span>that were left in the field, i.e., that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, ownerless utensils can be moved two thousand cubits in each direction. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the reason </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that they disagreed about a person </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">to convey the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">far-reaching </span>nature of the stringent ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that although there is </span>room <span class="gemarra-regular">to say: Since </span>a person who is <span class="gemarra-regular">awake acquires </span>for himself two thousand cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also acquires </span>them if he is <span class="gemarra-regular">sleeping, </span>the mishna nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that </span>the Rabbis did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>accept this argument, and this is why the dispute is taught specifically with respect to a person. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>we should understand his position differently, that <span class="gemarra-regular">in general Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan ben Nuri holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless objects do not acquire </span><span class="gemarra-regular">residence </span>of their own. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>with regard to a person, <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason is as follows: Since </span>a person who is <span class="gemarra-regular">awake acquires </span>for himself two thousand cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">he also </span><span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>them if he is <span class="gemarra-regular">sleeping.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a solution to this dilemma from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that fell on the eve of a Festival has two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thousand cubits in each direction, </span>meaning that one is permitted to carry the rainwater within a radius of two thousand cubits. But if the rain fell <span class="gemarra-regular">on the Festival </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is like the feet of all people, </span>as it did not acquire residence, and consequently one is permitted to carry this water wherever he is permitted to walk. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>it is understandable <span class="gemarra-regular">if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you say that Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> objects acquire residence; </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>ben Nuri, and consequently the rain that fell on the eve of the Festival acquired residence in the spot where it fell. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, if you say</span> that he maintains that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless objects do not acquire residence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Neither </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>ben Nuri, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as it clearly indicates that rain acquires a place of residence even though it has no owner. Rather, we must say that Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri is of the opinion that ownerless objects acquire residence, and this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with his opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye sat and recited this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tradition. Rav Safra said to Abaye: Perhaps we are dealing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with rain </span>that fell <span class="gemarra-regular">near a city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inhabitants of that city had it in mind, </span>and that is why it acquires two thousand cubits in each direction.
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: It should not enter your mind </span>that such an understanding is correct, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cistern that belongs to an individual, </span>its water is <span class="gemarra-regular">like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the feet of that individual, </span>the owner of the cistern, in that it may be carried wherever he is permitted to walk. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>a cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">that belongs to a particular</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> its water is <span class="gemarra-regular">like the feet of </span>the people of <span class="gemarra-regular">that city, </span>in that it may be carried wherever the inhabitants of that city may walk, i.e., two thousand cubits in each direction from the city. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> a cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">that belongs to pilgrims from Babyloni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> on the way to Eretz Yisrael, meaning that it belongs to all Jews and has no particular owner, its water is <span class="gemarra-regular">like the feet of the one who draws </span>the water, in that it may be carried wherever he is permitted to walk. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A cistern that belongs to </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">the tribes </span>and has no particular owner, its water <span class="gemarra-regular">has two thousand </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits in each direction. </span>If so, these two sources <span class="gemarra-regular">contradict </span><span class="gemarra-regular">each other, </span>as the mishna teaches that water that belongs to the entire community does not establish residence, whereas the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> holds that it may be carried two thousand cubits from its place.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>in order to resolve the contradiction, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from here: This </span>source, which states that the water may be carried two thousand cubits, was taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan ben Nuri, </span>who says that even ownerless objects acquire residence; <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>source, which states that water that does not belong to any particular person is like the feet of the one who draws it, was taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who say that ownerless objects do not acquire residence.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Yosef, he said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: This is what Rav Safra said, and this is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what I answered him. </span>Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> why did you not answer him from the </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">itself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? If it should enter your mind that we are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dealing with rain </span>that fell <span class="gemarra-regular">near a city, </span>how can you understand the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the rainwater <span class="gemarra-regular">has two thousand</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits in each direction?</span>
According to your understanding, that the rainwater may be carried two thousand cubits because the inhabitants of the town had it in mind, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">should have </span>said: The rainwater is <span class="gemarra-regular">like the feet of the inhabitants of that city. </span>Rather, you must say that the inhabitants of the city did not acquire the water and that it may be carried within a radius of two thousand cubits, because the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> was taught in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, that ownerless objects acquire residence. 
The Gemara further examines the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited earlier. <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Master said: </span>If rain fell <span class="gemarra-regular">on the Festiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is like the feet of all people. </span>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why </span>should this be? The water <span class="gemarra-regular">should have acquired residence in the ocean [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">okeyanos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where it was when the Festival began. And since the water went out on the Festival beyond its limit after it evaporated and formed into clouds, moving the water more than four cubits should be prohibited.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> was taught <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer. Because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Eliezer, he said: The entire world drinks from the waters </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the ocean; </span>that is to say, evaporated ocean water is the source of rain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Here we are dealing with clouds </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that were </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">formed on the eve of the Festival.</span> Since these clouds were already formed before the Festival, the water did not acquire residence in the ocean or travel beyond its limit on the Festival.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps those</span> clouds that had already been formed on the eve of the Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>away, <span class="gemarra-regular">and these </span>clouds, from which the rain fell, <span class="gemarra-regular">are others </span>that did acquire residence in the ocean? The Gemara answers: We are dealing here with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is </span>an identifying <span class="gemarra-regular">sign </span>that these are the same clouds and not others. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>that there is another reason we are not concerned that these might be other clouds: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>matter of whether or not they are the same clouds pertains to <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertainty </span>with respect to <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rabbinic law, </span>and the principle is that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertainty </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a rabbinic law, </span>one may follow the <span class="gemarra-regular">lenient </span>understanding. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the water <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span><span class="gemarra-regular">residence in the clouds, </span>where it was when the Festival began, and its limit should be measured from there. Since the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> taught that the water is like the feet of all people, if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">resolve from here </span>another dilemma, and say that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>prohibition of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits </span><span class="gemarra-regular">above ten </span>handbreadths, and one is permitted to travel more than two thousand cubits above this height. <span class="gemarra-regular">For if there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a prohibition of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits </span>above ten handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">let</span> the water <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire residence in the clouds.</span>
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>I can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you: There</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a prohibition of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits </span>even above ten handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the water </span>does not acquire residence in the clouds because it <span class="gemarra-regular">is absorbed in the clouds. </span>Since water does not exist in its usual state within the clouds, but rather takes on a different form, it does not acquire residence there. 

Daf 46a

The Gemara raises a difficulty: If the water was previously not in its current state, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it be </span>considered as something that <span class="gemarra-regular">came into being [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nolad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>on the Festival, and consequently it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry it. Something that came into being or assumed its present form on Shabbat or Festivals is considered set-aside [<span class="it-text">muktze</span>] and may not be handled on Shabbat or Festivals. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>we should say: <span class="gemarra-regular">The water in clouds </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>constant <span class="gemarra-regular">motion </span>and therefore does not acquire residence there. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you have arrived at this </span>answer, <span class="gemarra-regular">the ocean should also</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not be difficult for you, </span>as the <span class="gemarra-regular">water in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ocean is also in </span>constant <span class="gemarra-regular">motion. And it was taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Flowing rivers and streaming springs are like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the feet of all people, </span>as their waters do not acquire residence in any particular place. The same law also applies to clouds and seas.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Levi said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that one who was asleep at the beginning of Shabbat may travel two thousand cubits in every direction. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi: </span>Did <span class="gemarra-regular">you hear </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">explicitly </span>from Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, <span class="gemarra-regular">or did you understand </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it by inference </span>from some other ruling that he issued? Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I heard </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">explicitly </span>from him.
The Gemara asks: From <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>other teaching could this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">be inferred? </span>The Gemara explains: From that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with the lenient </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I need both? </span>Why was it necessary for Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to state both the general ruling that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the lenient opinion with regard to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, and also the specific ruling that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri on this issue?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: </span>Both rulings <span class="gemarra-regular">were necessary, as had he informed us </span>only that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan ben Nuri, I would have said </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with him <span class="gemarra-regular">whether this is a leniency</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., that a sleeping person acquires residence and may walk two thousand cubits in every direction, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a stringency, </span>i.e., that ownerless utensils acquire residence and can be carried only two thousand cubits from that place. <span class="gemarra-regular">Consequently, he teaches us </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with the lenient </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>so that we rule in accordance with Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri only when it entails a leniency.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him state </span>only that <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with the lenient </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Why do I need </span>the statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan ben Nuri? </span>
The Gemara answers: This ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">was necessary </span>as well, for had he informed us only that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the lenient opinion with regard to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">it might have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">entered your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this statement applies only </span>to disputes in which <span class="gemarra-regular">a single </span>authority disagrees <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">single </span>authority, <span class="gemarra-regular">or several </span>authorities disagree with <span class="gemarra-regular">several </span>other authorities. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">a single </span>authority maintains a lenient opinion against <span class="gemarra-regular">several </span>authorities who maintain a more stringent position, you might have <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that we do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>rule in his favor. Hence, it was necessary to state that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri although he disputes the Rabbis. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Abaye: Now, since </span>the laws of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are rabbinic </span>in origin, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>reason is there for <span class="gemarra-regular">me</span> to differentiate between a disagreement of <span class="gemarra-regular">a single </span>authority <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a single </span>authority and a disagreement of <span class="gemarra-regular">a single </span>authority <span class="gemarra-regular">with several </span>authorities? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to Rava: Is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there no difference with regard to rabbinic </span>laws <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>a disagreement of <span class="gemarra-regular">a single </span>authority <span class="gemarra-regular">with a single </span>authority, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> a disagreement of <span class="gemarra-regular">a single </span>authority with <span class="gemarra-regular">several </span>authorities? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Elazar says: Any woman who passed three </span>expected menstrual <span class="gemarra-regular">cycles</span> without experiencing bleeding is presumed not to be menstruating. If afterward she sees blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is enough </span>that she be regarded as ritually impure due to menstruation <span class="gemarra-regular">from the time</span> that she examined herself  and saw that she had a discharge, rather than retroactively for up to twenty-four hours. The Rabbis, however, maintain that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies only to an older woman or to a woman after childbirth, for whom it is natural to stop menstruating, but not to a normal young woman for whom three periods have passed without bleeding.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">It once happened that Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">ruled </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar. After he remembered </span>that Rabbi Elazar’s colleagues disagree with him on this matter and that he had apparently ruled incorrectly, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar is worthy to rely upon in exigent circumstances</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">After he remembered? If you say</span> that it means <span class="gemarra-regular">after he remembered </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar but</span> rather <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">how could he rule in accordance with him </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exigent circumstances, </span>given that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> had been decided against him?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> had <span class="gemarra-regular">not been</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated </span>on this matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, nor in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. And after he remembered that it was not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a single </span>authority who <span class="gemarra-regular">disagreed with </span>Rabbi Elazar, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>rather <span class="gemarra-regular">several </span>authorities who <span class="gemarra-regular">disagreed with him, he </span>nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Elazar is worthy to rely upon in exigent circumstances. </span>This demonstrates that even with a dispute that involves a rabbinic decree, such as whether a woman is declared ritually impure retroactively, there is room to distinguish between a disagreement of a single authority and a single authority, and a disagreement of a single authority and several authorities.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mesharshiya said to Rava, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak </span>who said <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rava: Is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there no difference with regard to rabbinic </span>laws <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>a disagreement of <span class="gemarra-regular">a single </span>authority <span class="gemarra-regular">with a single </span>authority, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> a disagreement of <span class="gemarra-regular">a single </span>authority <span class="gemarra-regular">with several </span>authorities? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If a person receives <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">proximate report </span>that one of his close relatives has died, <span class="gemarra-regular">he practices </span>all the customs of the intense <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>day mourning period as well as the customs of the <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty </span>day mourning period. But if he receives <span class="gemarra-regular">a distant </span>report, <span class="gemarra-regular">he practices </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one day </span>of mourning.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>considered a <span class="gemarra-regular">proximate </span>report, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is </span>considered a <span class="gemarra-regular">distant </span>report? If the report arrives <span class="gemarra-regular">within thirty </span>days of the close relative’s passing, it is regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">proximate, </span>and if it arrives <span class="gemarra-regular">after thirty </span>days it is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">distant; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Akiva. But the Rabbis say: Both </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a proximate report and </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a distant report, </span>the grieving relative <span class="gemarra-regular">practices </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">seven-</span>day mourning period <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty-</span>day mourning period.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan said: Wherever you find </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a single </span>authority <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lenient </span>with regard to a certain <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and several </span>other authorities <span class="gemarra-regular">are stringent, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> words of the stringent </span>authorities, who constitute <span class="gemarra-regular">the majority, except</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for here, where despite </span>the fact that the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva is lenient and the </span>opinion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">stringent, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">holds like Shmuel, as Shmuel said: The</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with the lenient </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">mourning </span>practices, i.e., wherever there is a dispute with regard to mourning customs, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the lenient opinion.
From here the Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mourning </span>practices <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Sages were lenient, but in general, </span>with regard to other areas of <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">even in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">case of rabbinic </span>laws <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a difference </span>between a disagreement of <span class="gemarra-regular">a single </span>authority <span class="gemarra-regular">with a single </span>authority and a disagreement of <span class="gemarra-regular">a single </span>authority <span class="gemarra-regular">with several </span>authorities. This being the case, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi did well to rule explicitly that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, even though he is a single authority who ruled leniently in dispute with the Rabbis. 

Daf 46b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said </span>a different explanation for the fact that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi made both statements: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary </span>for Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to inform us that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, because had he said only that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> follows the lenient opinion with regard to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">it could have entered your mind to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this statement applies only with regard to </span>the laws governing the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of courtyards, </span>which are entirely rabbinic in origin. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to </span>the more stringent laws governing the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits, </span>you would have <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that we should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>rule leniently, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to make both statements. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where do you say that we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> distinguish between an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of courtyards and an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of</span> Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits? As we learned </span>in a mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda said: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said, </span>that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may be established for another person only with his knowledge? It was said <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limits, but with regard to an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> courtyards, an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may be established </span>for another person whether <span class="gemarra-regular">with his knowledge or without his knowledge, as one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> act in a person’s interest in his absence; however</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, one may not act to a person’s disadvantage in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his absence. </span>One may act unilaterally on someone else’s behalf when the action is to that other person’s benefit; however, when it is to the other person’s detriment, or when there are both advantages and disadvantages to him, one may act on the other person’s behalf only if one has been explicitly appointed as an agent. Since an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> of courtyards is always to a person’s benefit, it can be established even without his knowledge. However, with regard to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> of Shabbat limits, while it enables one to walk in one direction, it disallows him from walking in the opposite direction. Therefore, it can be established only with his knowledge. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said </span>that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s need to issue two rulings can be explained in another manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is necessary </span>for Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to inform us that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, as if he had said only that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the lenient opinion with regard to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">it could have entered your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">statement applies only with regard to the remnants of an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> that had been properly established, where the concern is that it might subsequently have become invalid. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to an initial </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> that is just being established and has not yet taken effect, you might have <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that we should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>rule leniently, and therefore it was necessary to issue both rulings.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where do you say that we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> distinguish between the remnants of an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and an initial</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said, </span>that the Sages stipulated that a fixed quantity of food is necessary for establishing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an initial </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., when setting up an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the first time; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, with regard to the remnants</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., on a subsequent Shabbat when the measure may have become diminished, <span class="gemarra-regular">even a minimal amount</span> suffices. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And they said to establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for courtyards only </span>after all the inhabitants of the city merge their alleyways and become like the inhabitants of a single courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that the law of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be forgotten by the children, </span>who may not be aware of the arrangement that has been made with regard to the alleyways. 
Since the Gemara discussed the principles cited with regard to halakhic decision-making, it cites additional principles. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zerika said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva </span>in disputes <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>any individual <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei </span>even in disputes <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sages</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi in disputes <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>any individual <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage.</span>
The Gemara asks: With regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> do these principles apply, meaning, to what degree are they binding? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>This is considered binding <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abba said: One is inclined </span>toward such a ruling in cases where an individual asks, but does not issue it as a public ruling in all cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: It appears </span>that one should rule this way, but it is not an established <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that is considered binding with regard to issuing rulings.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>In the case of a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda; </span>in the case of a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei, </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and, needless to say, </span>in the case of a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei, </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei. </span>As <span class="gemarra-regular">now, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">in disputes with Rabbi Yehuda, </span>the opinion of Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>accepted as law, <span class="gemarra-regular">need it </span>be stated that <span class="gemarra-regular">in disputes with Rabbi Yosei, </span>Rabbi Meir’s opinion is rejected? Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion is not accepted in disputes with Rabbi Yosei.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Asi said: I also learn </span>based on the same principle that in a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon, </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosei. As Rabbi Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>In cases of dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon, </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Now, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>it is opposed by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>the opinion of Rabbi Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>accepted as law, <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> it is opposed by the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>with whom the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance against Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it necessary </span>to say that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei? 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a dilemma: </span>In a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? No sources were found to resolve this dilemma, and it <span class="gemarra-regular">stands </span>unresolved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mesharshiya said: These principles </span>of halakhic decision-making <span class="gemarra-regular">are not </span>to be relied upon. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where does Rav Mesharshiya </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>statement? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you say </span>that he derived it <span class="gemarra-regular">from that which we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learned </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon said: To what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is this comparable? </span>It is like <span class="gemarra-regular">three courtyards that open</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into one another, and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">open into a public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the two outer </span>courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> middle one, </span>the residents of the middle one <span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>carry to the two outer ones, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted to </span>carry to <span class="gemarra-regular">it, but the </span>residents of the <span class="gemarra-regular">two outer </span>courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited to </span>carry from <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>to the <span class="gemarra-regular">other, </span>as they did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with one another. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon; and who disagrees with </span>Rabbi Shimon on this matter? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. Didn’t you say: </span>In disputes between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon, </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda? Rather, can </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we not conclude from </span>this mishna that these principles should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be relied upon?
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the difficulty </span>posed by this ruling? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps where it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is stated </span>explicitly to the contrary, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is not stated </span>explicitly to the contrary, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not stated, </span>and these principles apply.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the proof is <span class="gemarra-regular">from that which we learned </span>elsewhere in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If a city that belongs to a </span>single <span class="gemarra-regular">individual </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes </span>one that <span class="gemarra-regular">belongs to many </span>people, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may establish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> of courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">for all of it. </span>But if the city <span class="gemarra-regular">belongs to many </span>people, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it </span>falls into the possession <span class="gemarra-regular">of a </span>single <span class="gemarra-regular">individual, one may not establish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for all of it, unless he excludes </span>from the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> an area the size <span class="gemarra-regular">of the town of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥadasha in Judea, which contains fifty residents; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>

Daf 47a

The excluded area need not be so large; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">three courtyards </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">containing two houses </span>are sufficient for this purpose. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon; and who disagrees with </span>Rabbi Shimon on this matter? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. Didn’t you say: </span>In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon </span>disagree, the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>This teaches that one should not rely on these principles. 
The Gemara rejects this argument as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the difficulty </span>here? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here, too, where it is stated </span>explicitly that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is not stated </span>explicitly, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and the principle that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda applies.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the proof is <span class="gemarra-regular">from that which we learned </span>elsewhere in a mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who left his house </span>without making an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> of courtyards, <span class="gemarra-regular">and established residence </span>for Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">in a different town, whether </span>he was <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew, </span>his lack of participation <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibits the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">residents </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the courtyards </span>in which he has a share to carry objects from their houses to the courtyard, because he did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with them, and failure to include a house in the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> imposes restrictions upon all the residents of the courtyard. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: His </span>lack of participation <span class="gemarra-regular">does not prohibit </span>the others to carry, since he is not present there. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span>Lack of participation in an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> by <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile </span>who is away <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibits </span>the others to carry, because he might return on Shabbat; but lack of participation by <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew </span>who is not present <span class="gemarra-regular">does not prohibit </span>the others to carry, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is not the way of a Jew to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">return on Shabbat </span>once he has already established his residence elsewhere. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: Even if he left his house </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and established residence </span>for Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">with his daughter in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">same town, his </span>lack of participation <span class="gemarra-regular">does not prohibit </span>the residents of his courtyard to carry, even though he is permitted to return home, <span class="gemarra-regular">because he has already removed it, </span>i.e., returning, <span class="gemarra-regular">from his mind. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon. And who disagrees with him? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t you say: </span>When there is a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon, </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda? </span>This teaches that one cannot rely upon these principles.
The Gemara rejects this argument again: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the difficulty </span>here? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps here, too, where it is </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated; </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>such a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is not stated, it is not stated, </span>and the principle that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda is relied upon.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the proof is <span class="gemarra-regular">from that which we learned </span>in the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is what </span>the Sages meant when <span class="gemarra-regular">they said: A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pauper can establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his feet; </span>that is to say, he may walk to a place within his Shabbat limit and declare: Here shall be my place of residence, and then his Shabbat limit is measured from that spot. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: We </span>apply this law <span class="gemarra-regular">only to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a pauper, </span>who does not have food for two meals; only such a person is permitted to establish his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> by walking to the spot that he wishes to acquire as his place of residence. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda says: </span>This allowance applies <span class="gemarra-regular">both to a pauper and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to a wealthy person. </span>Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">they said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one can </span><span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with bread only in order to </span>make placing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">easier for a wealthy person, so that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>trouble himself and <span class="gemarra-regular">go out and establish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his feet, </span>but the basic <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is established by walking to the spot one will acquire as his place of residence. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥiyya bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ashi </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>this law to <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥiyya bar Rav in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the presence of Rav, </span>saying: This allowance applies <span class="gemarra-regular">both to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a pauper and to a wealthy person, and Rav said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: </span>When you teach this law, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude also with </span>this ruling: The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I need a second </span>ruling? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t you </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>When there is a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir and Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda, </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda? </span>The fact that Rav needed to specify that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda on this matter indicates that he does not accept the general principle that when there is a dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.
The Gemara rejects this reasoning: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the difficulty</span> here? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps Rav does not accep</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these principles, </span>but the other Sages accept them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the Gemara brings a proof <span class="gemarra-regular">from that which we learned</span> in another mishna with regard to a woman waiting for her brother-in-law, i.e., a woman whose husband died without children but who is survived a by a brother. The brother-in-law is obligated by Torah law either to perform levirate marriage with his deceased brother’s widow, or to free her to marry others by participating in <span class="it-text">ḥalitza</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The woman waiting for her brother-in-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">law may neither participate in </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalitz</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">nor undergo levirate marriage</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until three months have passed </span>following her husband’s death, due to concern that she may be pregnant from him, in which case she is exempt from levirate marriage and <span class="it-text">ḥalitza</span>. After the three-month waiting period it will become clear whether she is pregnant from her husband.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, all other women may not be married or </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until three months have passe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> following their divorce or the death of their husbands, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">virgins or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">non-virgins, whether </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">widows or divorcees, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>they became widowed or divorced when they were <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothed or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">married. </span>In all cases, the woman may not marry for three months. Otherwise, if she is within the first three months of her pregnancy from her first husband, and she gives birth six months later, a doubt would arise as to the identity of the father. The Sages did not differentiate between cases where this concern is applicable and where it is not; rather, they fixed a principle that applies universally. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>A woman who had been <span class="gemarra-regular">married</span> when she became widowed or divorced <span class="gemarra-regular">may be betrothed </span>immediately, as couples do not have relations during the period of their betrothal. However, she may not marry until three months have passed, in order to differentiate between any possible offspring from the first and second husband. 
A woman who had only been <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothed </span>when she became widowed or divorced <span class="gemarra-regular">may be married </span>immediately, as it may be assumed that the couple did not have relations during the period of their betrothal. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">except for a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">betrothed woman in Judea, because </span>there the bridegroom’s <span class="gemarra-regular">heart </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is bold, </span>as it was customary for couples to be alone together during the period of betrothal, and consequently there is a suspicion that they might have had relations, in which case she might be carrying his child. However, no similar concern applies in other places.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: All the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> women </span>listed above <span class="gemarra-regular">may be betrothed </span>immediately, because the decree applies only with regard to marriage; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">except for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a widow, </span>who must wait for a different reason, <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span> of the <span class="gemarra-regular">mourning </span>for her deceased husband.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we said </span>with regard to this: It once happened that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer did not come to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the study hall. He met Rabbi Asi, who was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">standing, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What did they say </span>today <span class="gemarra-regular">in the study hall? He said to him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan said as follows: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei. </span>Rabbi Eliezer asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">By inference, </span>can it be inferred from the fact that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with his opinion that only <span class="gemarra-regular">a single </span>authority <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees with him? </span>
Rabbi Asi answered: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught </span>in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">was eager to go to her father’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">house </span>and did not remain with her husband during his final days, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if she <span class="gemarra-regular">was angry with her husband </span>and they separated, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">her husband was elderly or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sick </span>and could not father children, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">she was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sick, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">barren, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">an elderly woman, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">a minor, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or a sexually underdeveloped woman </span>who is incapable of bearing children, <span class="gemarra-regular">or a woman who was unfit to give </span><span class="gemarra-regular">birth </span>for any other reason, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">her husband was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">imprisoned in jail, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">she had miscarried after the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">death of her husband, </span>so that there is no longer any concern that she might be pregnant from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>these women <span class="gemarra-regular">must wait three month</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> before remarrying or even becoming betrothed; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir, </span>who maintains that this decree applies to all women, even when the particular situation renders it unnecessary. In all these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei permits </span>the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">to be betrothed and to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> marry immediately.</span>
The Gemara resumes its question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I need </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan to state that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with Rabbi Yosei? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t you say: </span>In a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi Yosei, </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>and therefore the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> should be in accordance with him here as well? This implies that the principle is not to be relied upon.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the difficulty</span> here? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to exclude </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>Although there are many cases in which the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, nonetheless, the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Meir with respect to his decrees</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., in those cases where he imposed a restriction in a particular case due to its similarity to another case. For this reason Rabbi Yoḥanan had to say that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> here is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, notwithstanding its opposition to Rabbi Meir’s decree.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the proof that these principles do not apply is <span class="gemarra-regular">from that which was taught </span>in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may go to a fair of </span>idolatrous <span class="gemarra-regular">gentile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">buy animals, slaves, and maidservants from them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the purchase raises them to a more sanctified state; and he may buy <span class="gemarra-regular">houses, fields, and vineyards </span>from them, due to the mitzva to settle Eretz Yisrael; <span class="gemarra-regular">and he may write </span>the necessary deeds <span class="gemarra-regular">and confirm </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in their </span>gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">court</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> with an official seal, even though this involves an acknowledgement of their authority, <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is as though he were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rescuing </span>his property <span class="gemarra-regular">from their hands, </span>as the court’s confirmation and stamp of approval prevents the sellers from appealing the sale and retracting it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if he is a priest, he may become </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure </span>by going <span class="gemarra-regular">outside Eretz </span>Yisrael, where the earth and air are impure, in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to litigate </span>with them <span class="gemarra-regular">and to contest </span>their claims. <span class="gemarra-regular">And just as </span>a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">may become ritually impure </span>by going <span class="gemarra-regular">outside Eretz </span>Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">so may he become ritually impure </span>for this purpose by entering <span class="gemarra-regular">into a cemetery.</span>
The Gemara interrupts its presentation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to express surprise at this last ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">Can it enter your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mind </span>to say that a priest may enter <span class="gemarra-regular">a cemetery? </span>This would make him <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure by Torah law. </span>How could the Sages permit a priest to become ritually impure by Torah law?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">an area where there is uncertainty</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to the location of a grave or a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> corpse [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">haperas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>owing to the fact that a grave had been unwittingly plowed over, and the bones may have become scattered throughout the field. Such a field imparts ritual impurity only <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law. </span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">become </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure </span>and leave Eretz Yisrael in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to marry </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a woman or to study Torah </span>there. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>does this allowance apply? When <span class="gemarra-regular">he cannot find </span>a place <span class="gemarra-regular">to study </span>in Eretz Yisrael. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the priest can find a place <span class="gemarra-regular">to study </span>in Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may not become ritually impure </span>by leaving the country. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: Even when he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">can find </span>a place <span class="gemarra-regular">to study </span>Torah in Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may also </span>leave the country and <span class="gemarra-regular">become ritually impure,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because</span>

Daf 47b

<span class="gemarra-regular">a person does not merit to learn from everyone, </span>and it is possible that the only suitable teacher for him lives outside of Eretz Yisrael. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei reported </span>in support of his position: <span class="gemarra-regular">It once happened that Yosef </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the priest went to his teacher in Tzeidan, </span>outside Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">to learn Torah, </span>although the preeminent Sage of his generation, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, lived in Eretz Yisrael. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said </span>about this: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>was it necessary for Rabbi Yoḥanan to issue this ruling? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t you say: </span>In disputes between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>and so it should be obvious that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with his opinion? Apparently, this principle is not accepted.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: It was </span>nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to issue this ruling, , <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">entered your mind </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">applies </span>only with regard to disputes <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Mishna. But </span>with regard to disputes <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, say no, </span>the principle does not apply. Therefore, Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching us </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei in this case as well.
Since no proof has been found to support Rav Mesharshiya’s statement that there are no principles for issuing halakhic rulings, the Gemara emends his statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, this </span>is what Rav Mesharshiya <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: These principles were not accepted by all </span>authorities, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav did not accept these principles, </span>as demonstrated above.
The Gemara returns to addressing acquisition of residence. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: Objects </span><span class="gemarra-regular">belonging to a gentile do not acquire residence </span>and do not have a Shabbat limit, either on their own account or due to the ownership of the gentile. Accordingly, if they were brought into a town from outside its limits, a Jew may carry them two thousand cubits in each direction.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion was this statement made? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that it was made <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious. Now, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">unclaimed objects, which do not have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">owners, do not acquire residence, is it necessary </span>to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile’s objects, which have an owner, </span>do not acquire residence?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this statement must have been made <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Nuri, and </span>Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching us </span>that when we <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri said </span>that objects <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> residence, this applies only </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">unclaimed objects, which have no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> owners; but </span>it does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>apply to <span class="gemarra-regular">objects </span>belonging <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a gentile, which have owners.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Gemara raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Elazar says: </span>With regard to a Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">who borrowed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a utensil from a gentile on a Festival, and similarly </span>with regard to a Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">who lent a utensil to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile on the eve of a Festival and </span>the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">returned it to him on the Festival, and </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">utensils or bins that acquired residence within the </span>city’s Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, </span>in all these cases the utensils <span class="gemarra-regular">have, </span>i.e., can be moved, <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits in each </span><span class="gemarra-regular">direction. But if a gentile brought </span>the Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">produce from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>the Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, </span>the Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">may not move it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from its place.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted if you say that Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan ben Nuri holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">objects that belong to a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentile acquire residence, </span>one can say that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span>is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, </span>that even a gentile’s objects acquire residence.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, if you say that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">objects belonging to a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gentile do not acquire residence, </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">neither </span>in accordance with that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri nor </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>say that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s objects acquire residence, </span>and that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, </span>who said that they do not acquire residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">spoke in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you said, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that a gentile’s objects do not acquire residence, so this ruling need not have been stated at all. The Gemara answers: That is incorrect, as <span class="gemarra-regular">you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> might have said </span>that the Sages should issue a <span class="gemarra-regular">decree</span> in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">gentile owners </span>that his objects acquire residence in his location and that they may not be carried beyond two thousand cubits from that spot, lest people carry objects belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jewish owners </span>beyond their two-thousand-cubit limit. Therefore, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching us </span>that no decree was issued.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Objects that belong to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a gentil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire residence, </span>due to the aforementioned <span class="gemarra-regular">decree</span> issued in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">gentile owners due to </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Jewish owners.</span>
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">certain rams were brought to </span>the town of <span class="gemarra-regular">Mavrakhta </span>on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava permitted the residents of Meḥoza to purchase the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> and take them home, although Mavrakhta was outside the Shabbat limit of Meḥoza and could be reached by the residents of Meḥoza only by way of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> of Shabbat limits.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rava: What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is your reasoning </span>in permitting these rams? You must rely upon that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: Objects</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> belonging to a gentile do not acquire residence, </span>and so they are permitted even if they were brought to Meḥoza from outside the Shabbat limit. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>the principle, in disputes between <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel and Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? And Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Objects that belong to a gentile acquire residence, </span>based on <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile owner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, due to </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jewish owner. </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with his opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava reconsidered and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Let </span>the rams <span class="gemarra-regular">be sold </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">to the residents</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Mavrakhta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Although the rams acquired residence, and may be moved only four cubits as they were taken beyond their Shabbat limit, the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">all Mavrakhta is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like four cubits for them. </span>However, they may not be sold to the residents of Meḥoza, as the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A water-filled ditch [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥerem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>lies <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>two <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat limits requires </span>

Daf 48a

<span class="gemarra-regular">an iron partition to divide it </span>into two separate areas, so that the residents of both places may draw water from it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ḥanina, </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">laugh at this </span>teaching, as he deemed it unnecessary. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why did </span>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, <span class="gemarra-regular">laugh? If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>Rabbi Ḥiyya <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">stringently, in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Nuri, </span>saying that ownerless objects acquire a place of residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina <span class="gemarra-regular">holds leniently, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>and says that those objects do not acquire residence, this is difficult. Just <span class="gemarra-regular">because he holds leniently, does he laugh at one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who teaches stringently?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>he must have laughed for a different reason, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Flowing rivers</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and streaming springs are like the feet of all people</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as the water did not acquire residence in any particular spot. Consequently, one who draws water from rivers and springs may carry it wherever he is permitted to walk, even if it had previously been located outside his Shabbat limit. According to Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> should apply to the water in the ditch. 
The Gemara rejects this argument: No proof can be brought from this ruling concerning rivers and springs, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>we are dealing here with a ditch of still, <span class="gemarra-regular">collected </span>water that belongs exclusively to the residents of that particular place. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, must have laughed for a different reason, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>Rabbi Ḥiyya <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in his <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the ditch <span class="gemarra-regular">requires an iron partition </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to divide it </span>into two separate sections. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, argued: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why is </span>a partition of <span class="gemarra-regular">reeds </span><span class="gemarra-regular">different, that </span>we should say it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>effective in that case? Apparently, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because water enters it </span>and passes from one limit to the other. But this is difficult, as <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in the case of a partition <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> iron, water enters it </span>and passes from one limit to another, as it cannot be hermetically sealed. If so, what does the iron accomplish that the reeds do not accomplish?
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying</span> as follows: A water-filled ditch that lies between two Shabbat limits <span class="gemarra-regular">requires </span>an iron partition to divide it into two separate sections. <span class="gemarra-regular">But there is no remedy, </span>because it is impossible to hermetically seal a partition of that kind, and therefore its water may not be used.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>you must say that Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, laughed at Rabbi Ḥiyya’s teaching for a different reason, <span class="gemarra-regular">because the Sages were lenient with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> water. </span>The Rabbis said that a minimal partition suffices in the case of water. Consequently, there should be no need for an iron partition.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>the case involving <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tavla, as Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Tavla asked of Rav: Does a suspended partition, </span>i.e., a partition that is suspended and does not reach the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">permit </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">in a ruin? </span>Do we say that the remnants of the walls that are suspended in the air are considered as though they descend to the ground and close off the area, so that it is regarded as a private domain? 
Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: A suspended partition </span>of this kind <span class="gemarra-regular">permits </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">only</span> in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">water, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages were lenient</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to water. </span>Just as the Sages were lenient about water with respect to a suspended partition, so too they should be lenient here and not require an iron partition; rather, a minimal partition should suffice, even one made of reeds.
The mishna taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say </span>that if a person is sleeping at the onset of Shabbat and has no intention of acquiring residence in his location, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits, </span>whereas Rabbi Yehuda says he can walk four cubits in any direction he chooses. The Gemara asks: What is the dispute? The opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda is </span>the same as that of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the Rabbis.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them, </span>as the Rabbis permit him to carry in an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">eight by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>cubits. Rabbi Yehuda maintains that he has only four cubits, in the direction of his choosing, whereas according to the Rabbis he has four cubits in every direction, which totals an area of eight by eight cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">That was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also taught </span>explicitly in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">He has eight by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eight </span>cubits; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir, </span>which is the opinion of the Rabbis of the mishna.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">stated: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda relates only <span class="gemarra-regular">to walking, but as for carryin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> objects, <span class="gemarra-regular">all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> agree </span>that to carry them <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed </span>permitted; but to carry them <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>than that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not.</span>
The Gemara inquires about the basis of this law: <span class="gemarra-regular">These four cubits</span> within which a person is always permitted to walk on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">where are they written </span>in the Torah? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“Remain every</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> man in his place; </span>let no man go out of his place on the seventh day” (Exodus 16:29), means one must restrict his movement to an area <span class="gemarra-regular">equal to his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> place. And how much is </span>the area of <span class="gemarra-regular">his place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>A person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">body </span>typically measures <span class="gemarra-regular">three cubits, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit </span>is needed <span class="gemarra-regular">in order </span>to allow him <span class="gemarra-regular">to spread out his hands and feet, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>A person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">body </span>measures <span class="gemarra-regular">three cubits, and an </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit </span>is needed <span class="gemarra-regular">in order </span>to allow him <span class="gemarra-regular">to pick up an object </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from under his feet and place it under his head, </span>meaning, to give him room to maneuver.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>in that Rabbi Yehuda provides him with <span class="gemarra-regular">exactly four cubit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> but no more; whereas Rabbi Meir maintains that we do not restrict him in this manner, but rather he is provided with expansive cubits, i.e., enough room to spread out his hands and feet, which measures slightly more than four cubits.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mesharshiya said to his son: When you come before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa, inquire of him </span>as follows: The <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ammot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>mentioned here, <span class="gemarra-regular">do we grant </span>them to each person measured <span class="gemarra-regular">according to his own forearm [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">amma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>i.e., the distance from his elbow to the tip of his index finger, <span class="gemarra-regular">or do we grant </span>them measured <span class="gemarra-regular">according to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the cubit [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">amma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] used for consecrated </span>property, i.e., a standard cubit of six medium handbreadths for everyone?
<span class="gemarra-regular">If he said to you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we provide him </span>four cubits measured <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the </span>standard <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit used for consecrated </span>property, <span class="gemarra-regular">what will be with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Og, king of the Bashan, </span>who is much larger than this? <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he said to you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> provide him </span>four cubits measured <span class="gemarra-regular">according to his own forearm</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, say to him: Why was </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">not taught together</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the other matters whose measures are determined by the specific measure of the person involved, in the mishna that teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">These are </span>matters <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to which they stated</span> measures <span class="gemarra-regular">all in accordance with the </span>specific measure of the <span class="gemarra-regular">person </span>involved. This means that the measures are not fixed, but rather change in accordance with the person in question. If the four cubits are measured according to each person’s forearm, this law should have been included in the mishna. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Rav Mesharshiya’s son <span class="gemarra-regular">came before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Pappa, </span>the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Were we to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be so precise</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we would not </span>be able <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learn </span>anything <span class="gemarra-regular">at all, </span>as we would be too busy answering such questions. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">In fact</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, we grant him </span>four cubits measured <span class="gemarra-regular">according to his own</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forearm. And as for that which was difficult for you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, why was </span>this law <span class="gemarra-regular">not taught </span>in the mishna that teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">These are </span>matters <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to which they stated</span> measures all in accordance with the specific measure of the person involved? It is because this law <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>absolutely <span class="gemarra-regular">clear-cut. </span>It occasionally must be adjusted, <span class="gemarra-regular">since there may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be </span>a person <span class="gemarra-regular">whose limbs are small </span>in relation to his body. With regard to such a person, we do not measure four cubits according to the size of his own forearm, but rather by the standard cubits used for consecrated property.
The mishna taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">If there were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two </span>people positioned in a way that <span class="gemarra-regular">part of the</span> four <span class="gemarra-regular">cubits of the one </span>were subsumed within the four cubits of the other, they each may bring food and eat together in the shared area in the middle. Rabbi Shimon likened this case to that of three courtyards that open one into another, where the two outer courtyards established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with the middle one. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does </span>Rabbi Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">need to </span>offer an analogy and <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: To what may this be likened, </span>and thus connect our case to a different issue?
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what Rabbi Shimon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to the Rabbis: After all, to what is this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">similar? To three courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that open into one another, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">open into a public domain. What is different</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there that you disagree </span>with me and say that it is prohibited to carry from any one courtyard to any other, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is different here that you do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disagree </span>with me?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how do <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>reply? <span class="gemarra-regular">There </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">residents </span>of the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">are numerous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and some might come to carry objects in a place where it is prohibited to do so; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">residents</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not numerous, </span>and a mere three people can warn each other against Shabbat desecration.
The mishna taught: If the residents of the two outer courtyards established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with the middle one, it is permitted to carry from the middle one to the two outer ones, and it is permitted to carry from the middle one to the two outer ones. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is prohibited to carry from one of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two outer </span>courtyards to the other, as they did not establish a joint <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>is it prohibited? <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the residents of the <span class="gemarra-regular">outer </span>courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">established an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">middle one, they are </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">one, </span>and consequently, they should all be permitted with one another.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: </span>The mishna is referring to a case where the two outer courtyards did not place their <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in the middle courtyard; rather, to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the </span>residents of the <span class="gemarra-regular">middle </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">placed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its </span>first <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in this </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and its </span>second <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in that </span>courtyard, so that the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> of each of the other courtyards is not in the middle courtyard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Sheshet</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Even if you say that </span>the residents of each of the outer courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">placed their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the middle</span> courtyard, they are still not considered a single courtyard, as we are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with a case where they placed </span>each <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>

Daf 48b

<span class="gemarra-regular">in two </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">houses, </span>and consequently the two outer courtyards do not join together and become as one.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion did Rav Sheshet state that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> placed in two houses, even within the same courtyard, does not join the houses together? He must have said this in accordance <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>people who <span class="gemarra-regular">collected their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and placed it in two </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">utensils, </span>even in a single house, <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: Their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as the two parts of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> have not been deposited in the same place, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Hillel say: Their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> as long as the entire <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was deposited in a single domain.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even if you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that this is in accordance with the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel, Beit Hillel </span>may have <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>their opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there, with regard to two utensils </span>that are located <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one house </span>and consequently, they join together. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if the two utensils are located <span class="gemarra-regular">in two </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">houses, </span>even Beit Hillel agree that the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>valid.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi: </span>The explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yehuda is difficul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and the explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sheshet is difficult. </span>The explanation of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda is difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as he said </span>that it is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about a case</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where the middle </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">put its </span>first <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the one </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and its </span>second <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the other </span>courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, once the middle </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">establishes an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>one of the <span class="gemarra-regular">outer ones, they are </span>regarded <span class="gemarra-regular">as one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>so that <span class="gemarra-regular">when it later establishes an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> other </span>outer courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">it acts </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">on behalf </span>of the first outer courtyard, as both of them are treated like a single courtyard. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Sheshet is difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Since the two outer courtyards placed their respective <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span> in the middle courtyard, all are regarded as residents of the middle courtyard. And since each of the outer courtyards placed its <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in a different house, the case <span class="gemarra-regular">should be</span> treated <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">who lived in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> same courtyard, one of whom forgot and did not join</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, where they </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibit one another </span>to carry in the courtyard. Similarly in this case, all should be prohibited to carry in the middle courtyard, the residents of the middle courtyard as well as the residents of the outer courtyards.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">It is not difficult </span>according to the explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda and it is not difficult </span>according to the explanation of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet. It is not difficult </span>according to the explanation of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda, since the </span>residents of the <span class="gemarra-regular">middle </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>each of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>two <span class="gemarra-regular">outer </span>courtyards, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span>residents of the <span class="gemarra-regular">two outer </span>courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with one another. </span>The residents of each of the outer courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">indicated that it desired </span>to join <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the middle courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">but did not desire </span>to join <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the other outer courtyard. Since the residents of the outer courtyards demonstrated that that they did not want to join together and form a common <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, they cannot be forced to do so. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">difficult </span>according to the explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Sheshet. If they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the people living in the outer courtyards are considered as <span class="gemarra-regular">residents </span>of the middle courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">as a leniency, </span>so that they should be permitted to carry in the middle courtyard, does this mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">they will say </span>that they are considered <span class="gemarra-regular">residents </span>of the middle courtyard also <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a stringency</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that they should be prohibited from carrying in the middle courtyard as if they live there?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: This </span>statement in the mishna, that objects may be carried from either of the outer courtyards into the middle courtyard and also from the middle courtyard into either of the outer courtyards, <span class="gemarra-regular">is the statement of, </span>i.e., in accordance with the opinion of, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But the Rabbis say: One domain serves two domains</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> That is to say, it is permitted to carry objects from either of the outer courtyards into the inner one, as no prohibition is imposed upon the outer courtyards, given that both established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with the middle courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">two domains do not serve one domain, </span>meaning that it is prohibited to carry objects from the middle courtyard into either of the two outer courtyards. The utensils of the middle courtyard are drawn after the other two, meaning that were he to bring them into one of the outer courtyards, he would be regarded as having removed them from the other.
Rav Yehuda relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">When I recited </span>this teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">before Shmuel, he said to me: </span>

Daf 49a

<span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>teaching, that carrying objects from either of the outer courtyards into the middle courtyard is permitted, is <span class="gemarra-regular">also the statement of, </span>i.e., in accordance with, the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon. But the Rabbis say: All </span><span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited, </span>that is to say, carrying is prohibited from any of the courtyards to any of the others.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda, in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rabbi Shimon said: To what is this comparable? </span>It is comparable <span class="gemarra-regular">to three courtyards that open into one another, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">open into a public domain. If the two</span> outer courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with the middle </span>one, a resident of one of the outer courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">may bring </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">from a house </span>in that courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and eat </span>it in the middle courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>likewise a resident of the other courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">may bring </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">from a house </span>in that courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and eat </span>it in the middle courtyard. And similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> resident <span class="gemarra-regular">may bring leftovers </span>from the house where he ate <span class="gemarra-regular">back into </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">house </span>in that courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that resident</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may bring leftovers </span>from the house where he ate <span class="gemarra-regular">back</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">house </span>in this courtyard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, the Rabbis say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: All three </span>courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited. </span>Since the residents of the outer courtyards are prohibited to carry from one outer courtyard to the other, this results in a place where carrying is prohibited, and such a place prohibits carrying in all three courtyards. 
The Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel follows his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning </span>that he used elsewhere, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is between two alleyways</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if that courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">established </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with both </span>alleyways, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited with both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of them. </span>Since the residents of the two alleyways are prohibited to carry from one to the other and the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> enables the residents of the two alleyways to carry in the courtyard, it is prohibited to carry from the courtyard into the alleyways, so that the residents of the alleyways do not transfer objects from one alleyway to the other via the courtyard. 
If the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with either </span>alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">it prohibits </span>one to carry in <span class="gemarra-regular">both of them. </span>Since the residents of the courtyard were accustomed to utilizing both alleyways and did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with either alleyway, the result is that each alleyway has a courtyard that did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, which prohibits carrying from the courtyard into either alleyway. 
If, however, the residents of the courtyard were <span class="gemarra-regular">accustomed to utilizing </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>alleyway, while <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">not accustomed to utilizin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>alleyway, then with regard to the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">accustomed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to utilizing, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>to carry there, as the residents of the courtyard did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">not accustomed to utilizing, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>to carry there, as the residents of the courtyard are not considered residents of that alleyway. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna said: </span>With regard to residents of a courtyard who <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with</span> the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">were not accustomed to utilizing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">were accustomed to utilizing is permitted</span> to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on its own </span>without the courtyard. The residents of the courtyard have demonstrated their intention to use the other alleyway, despite their not being accustomed to doing so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: If </span>the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the residents of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">were accustomed to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">utilizing established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on its own </span>without the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">while </span>the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">were not accustomed to utilizing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>also the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">itself </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> with either alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">we divert </span>the residents of the courtyard to use the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">not accustomed to utilizing. </span>This is because there is one alleyway in which it is prohibited to carry due to the lack of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, and a second alleyway in which it is permitted to carry; while it is prohibited for the residents of the courtyard to carry. As explained above, were they to utilize the alleyway which they are accustomed to utilizing, the other residents of the alleyway would also be prohibited to carry from their courtyards into the alleyway, despite having established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for their own alleyway. However, if they use the other alleyway, the residents of that alleyway will not lose anything; since they did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, it is prohibited for them to carry in that alleyway regardless.
<span class="gemarra-regular">In a case such as this, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one compels </span>another to refrain from behavior <span class="gemarra-regular">characteristic of Sodom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> We force a person to waive his legal rights in order to prevent him from acting in a manner characteristic of the wicked city of Sodom. If one denies another use of his possessions, even though he would incur no loss or damage by granting use of his property, his conduct is considered to be characteristic of Sodom. The courts may sometimes compel such a person to waive his legal rights.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is particular about</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., that the other people should not eat of the food he contributed, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>After all, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">name? Joining [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is its name, </span>indicating that it must be jointly owned [<span class="it-text">me’urav</span>] by all the participants in the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. If one person does not allow the other participants to eat of it, it does not belong to all of them and cannot be called an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina said: </span>Even in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, however, </span>that person <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> called </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">of the men of Vardina</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The men of Vardina were renowned misers, meaning that he is considered to be like them. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who divides his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiru</span><span class="gemarra-italic">v</span> into two parts, his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is not a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This is for the aforementioned reason that, by definition, an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> needs to be indicative of joining, and this <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is separated into different parts.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion did Shmuel state this teaching? Could it be <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>people who <span class="gemarra-regular">collected their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">placed it in two </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">utensils, Beit Shammai say: This </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, whereas Beit Hillel say: This </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>It does not stand to reason that Shmuel would follow Beit Shammai, whose opinion is not accepted as normative law.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even if you say </span>that Shmuel stated his opinion in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel, Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Hillel stated </span>their opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only there, where the </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">utensil </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was filled and there was </span>still some food <span class="gemarra-regular">left over, </span>and therefore, some of the leftover food had to be placed in a second utensil. <span class="gemarra-regular">But where they divided it </span>from the outset, even Beit Hillel agree that the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>valid.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I need two </span>rulings that are based on the same principle, i.e., that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> must demonstrate joining? The Gemara answers: Both rulings were <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. As, had </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>the ruling only <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with regard to one who is particular about his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, one might have said that the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is not valid <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the person <span class="gemarra-regular">is particular </span>and expressly does not desire that his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> be eaten by others. <span class="gemarra-regular">However here, </span>with regard to one who divides the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> into different parts, one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that his portion should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be considered as separated from the rest.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And had </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>the ruling only <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to one who divides his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, one might have said that the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is not valid <span class="gemarra-regular">because he divided it up, </span>thereby physically separating himself from the others. <span class="gemarra-regular">However there, </span>with regard to one who is particular about his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that his portion should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be considered as separated from the rest, since no act of separation was performed. Consequently, both rulings were <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said to Rav Yehuda in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the olive press in Rav Zakkai’s house: Did Shmuel </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who divides </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is not a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Didn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel say </span>elsewhere: <span class="gemarra-regular">The house in which the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> need not contribute bread </span>for the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this ruling? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not because </span>Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>there is bread <span class="gemarra-regular">lying</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a basket </span>somewhere in the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>regarded <span class="gemarra-regular">as if it were placed here </span>with the rest of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>one should say that <span class="gemarra-regular">since</span> the bread <span class="gemarra-regular">is placed in a basket, </span>i.e., in one of the two utensils containing the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span> regarded <span class="gemarra-regular">as if it were placed here </span>with the rest of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
Rav Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: There </span>Shmuel validates the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">although there is no bread </span>in the house in which the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is deposited. And <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>for his ruling? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>by placing food in a particular house, <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the residents of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>regarded <span class="gemarra-regular">as living here. </span>Therefore, those living in that house need not contribute bread for the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, as they are certainly residents of the house.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: An </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> that is deposited in a house is effective <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition, </span>as each person who contributes a portion of food acquires the right to a certain use of the residence and is considered one of its residents. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if you say: Why </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">can one not acquire </span>this right <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>payment of a coin such as <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ma</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>but rather only through bread? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span> a <span class="it-text">ma’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>always <span class="gemarra-regular">available on Shabbat eve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as many people spend all of their available money for the necessities of Shabbat, and it is difficult to find money available at that hour.
The Gemara asks: If so, according to Shmuel’s opinion, in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> with money, <span class="gemarra-regular">it should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nonetheless acquire, </span>i.e., be valid. According to his opinion, there is no fundamental reason to invalidate the acquisition of rights in the residence through the payment of money, yet there is no indication that this position is valid.
The Gemara answers: Even Shmuel did not permit one to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with money, due to <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree lest </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">say that a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ma’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is essential, and sometimes a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ma’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will not be available, and they will not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>to prepare <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with bread, and </span>the halakhic category of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will be forgotten.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span>disagreed with Shmuel and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: An </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> is effective <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">residence. </span>Each person who contributes a portion of food is considered as if he resides, for that Shabbat, in the residence in which the food is deposited. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the practical, halakhic difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between these </span>two understandings? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with regard to the question of whether an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may be established with <span class="gemarra-regular">a utensil. </span>If an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is effective based on the principle of acquisition, in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel, then one should be able to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with a utensil; whereas, this would not constitute a valid <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, according to the opinion of Rabba. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>another practical difference between them is with regard to whether an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may be established with food that is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than the value of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> According to Shmuel’s opinion, this would not be a valid <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, as there is no acquisition with something less than the value of a <span class="it-text">peruta</span>; whereas according to Rabba’s opinion, since an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is effective by establishing a person’s residence, this can be done even with an amount of food worth less than a <span class="it-text">peruta</span>. 

Daf 49b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there is another practical difference between them with regard to the question whether <span class="gemarra-regular">a minor </span>may collect the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> from the residents of the courtyard and deposit it in one of the houses. According to Shmuel’s opinion, this would not be a valid <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, for a minor cannot serve as an agent to effect acquisition, whereas according to Rabba’s opinion, the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is valid, as the food itself establishes the common residence for all the residents.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rabba: It is difficult according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to your </span>opinion that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is effective based on the principle of residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is difficult according to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel </span>that it is effective based on the principle of acquisition. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">who collected their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, when they take their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> elsewhere, </span>in order to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> together with another courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>person may <span class="gemarra-regular">take it </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">for all of them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">that person who acquires </span>rights, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nobody else, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">that person who gains</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> residence, and nobody else. </span>In that case, how can the others rely on this <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>?
Rabba said <span class="gemarra-regular">to him: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">neither difficult according to my </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, </span>as, the person who takes the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">acts as an agent, </span>effecting acquisition or determining residence <span class="gemarra-regular">on behalf of all of them. </span>
With regard to the case of the three courtyards addressed above, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥama bar Gurya said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon</span> that it is permitted to carry from the middle courtyard into either of the two outer ones; and vice versa, however, it is prohibited to carry from one outer courtyard to the other. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was coming along the way </span>on Shabbat eve, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> grew dark </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>was traveling, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> familiar </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a tre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a fence </span>located two thousand cubits from his current location, and two thousand cubits from his house, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he said: My residence is beneath </span>that tree, rather than in his present location, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not said anything, </span>as he did not establish a fixed location as his residence.
If, however, he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">My residence </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is at </span>the tree’s <span class="gemarra-regular">trunk, </span>he acquired residence there, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">walk from the place he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">standing to the trunk </span>of the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits </span>away, <span class="gemarra-regular">and from the trunk </span>of the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">to his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> house, </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits. Consequently, he walks after</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nightfall </span>a total of <span class="gemarra-regular">four thousand cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">If one is not familiar </span>with a tree or any other noticeable landmark, <span class="gemarra-regular">or if he is not an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> expert in the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> unaware that residence can be established from a distance, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he said: My residence is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at my </span>current <span class="gemarra-regular">location, </span>then his presence at <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>current <span class="gemarra-regular">location acquires for him </span>the right to walk <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits in each direction</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The manner in which the two thousand cubits are measured is the subject of a tannaitic dispute. These cubits are measured <span class="gemarra-regular">circularly, </span>i.e., as a circle with a radius of two thousand cubits; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigenos. And the Rabbis say: </span>These are measured <span class="gemarra-regular">squarely, </span>i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">as a square tablet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> with each side measuring four thousand cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gains the corners. </span>He is permitted to walk from the middle to the corners of the square as well, a distance of approximately 2,800 cubits.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And this is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said: The pauper establishes an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">feet, </span>i.e., one who does not have the bread required to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may walk anywhere within his Shabbat limit and declare: This is my residence, and his Shabbat limit is measured from that location. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">We have </span>this leniency in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a pauper, </span>who does not have food for two meals. However, one who has bread may only establish residence with bread. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda says: </span>This leniency is in effect for <span class="gemarra-regular">both a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pauper and a wealthy person.  </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">establishes an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with bread only </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lenient with the wealthy </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that he </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> exert himself and <span class="gemarra-regular">go out and establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his feet. </span>Instead, he can appoint an agent to place bread for him in that location. This, however, does not negate the option of personally going to that location in order to establish residence without bread. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna that one who declares his intention to establish residence beneath a tree, without specifying the precise location, has not said anything. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the precise meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not said anything?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: He has not said anything at all, </span>and has failed to establish residence anywhere, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not even</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> go to </span>the place <span class="gemarra-regular">beneath </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">tree. </span>His failure to specify a particular location prevents him from establishing residence beneath the tree. The fact that he sought to establish residence someplace other than his present location prevents him from establishing residence at his present location. Accordingly, he may walk no more than four cubits from the place that he is standing.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shmuel said: He has not said anything </span>with regard to going <span class="gemarra-regular">to his home, </span>if it is two thousand cubits past the tree; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, </span>with regard to the area <span class="gemarra-regular">beneath</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if its bough is entirely within two thousand cubits of his present location <span class="gemarra-regular">he may </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">go</span> there.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>when we learned in the mishna that he did not establish residence, it means that the legal status of the area <span class="gemarra-regular">beneath the tree becomes </span>comparable to both <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey driver, </span>who walks behind the animal and prods it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a camel driver, </span>who walks before the animal and leads it in the sense that the tree is pulling him in both directions. Since he did not specify a particular location as his residence, any part of the area beneath the tree could be the place where he established residence.
Therefore, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he comes to measure </span>two thousand cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">from the north </span>of the tree in order to ascertain whether or not he may go to his home, because of the uncertainty with regard to the precise location where he established residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">one measures </span>the distance <span class="gemarra-regular">for him </span>stringently <span class="gemarra-regular">from the south. </span>And likewise if <span class="gemarra-regular">he comes to measure</span> the distance to his home <span class="gemarra-regular">from the south, one measures</span> the distance <span class="gemarra-regular">for him from the north. </span>

Daf 50a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: What is the reason for Rav’s </span>statement that one who declares his intention to establish residence beneath a tree has said nothing at all? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>he designated <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">defined</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since he did not establish his residence in one particular location, he did not establish it at all. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>an alternative version of Rabba’s statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: What is the reason </span>for the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Because he maintains: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Anything that cannot </span>be accomplished <span class="gemarra-regular">sequentially, </span>due to halakhic or practical considerations, <span class="gemarra-regular">even simultaneously</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cannot </span>be accomplished, as one negates the other. In this case, since one cannot establish residence in an area of four cubits on one side of a tree and proceed to establish residence in an area of four cubits on the other side of the tree, neither can he simultaneously establish residence beneath a tree greater than four cubits. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between these </span>two versions of Rabba’s statement? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said: Let </span>residence be <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired for me </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits of the eight </span>or more cubits beneath that tree. 
According to <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who said </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the place </span>he designated <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">defined, </span>here too, <span class="gemarra-regular">the place </span>he designated <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">defined, </span>as he failed to specify the precise location of the four cubits in which to establish his residence. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who said </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">anything that cannot </span>be accomplished <span class="gemarra-regular">sequentially even simultaneously </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot </span>be accomplished, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>if he established his residence in <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits, as here he stated </span>that he is designated only <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>as his place of residence.
The Gemara proceeds to analyze <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter</span> of Rabba’s statement <span class="gemarra-regular">itself. Rabba said: Anything that cannot</span> be accomplished <span class="gemarra-regular">sequentially even simultaneously </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot </span>be accomplished. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised an objection to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span>based on the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who increases tithes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he tithes two-tenths instead of one-tenth, the remainder of <span class="gemarra-regular">his produce is rendered </span>fit for consumption, as he properly tithed it; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, his tithes are ruined, </span>as the additional tenth is neither a tithe nor is it tithed produce. It is not a tithe because tithe status applies only to one tenth, and neither is it tithed produce as it was not tithed. Since it is unclear which of the two-tenths is the actual tithe and which is not, this produce may neither be treated as a tithe nor as tithed produce.
According to Rabba’s opinion, the question arises: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>should the produce be rendered fit for consumption? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>and apply his principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">Anything that cannot </span>be accomplished <span class="gemarra-regular">sequentially; even simultaneously </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot </span>be accomplished. Since one may not designate two tenths sequentially, one tenth followed by a second tenth, likewise, he should be precluded from simultaneously designating two tenths of his produce as a tithe. Accordingly, it should be considered as though he had not designated any tithe at all, and therefore his produce should not be regarded as tithed.
Gemara answers: The case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tithe is different, as </span>tithe status <span class="gemarra-regular">takes effect partially, </span>i.e., on less than a unit of produce. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if one said: Let half of each </span>grain of <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be designated </span>as tithed, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is designated. </span>Just as one can designate an entire grain of wheat as a tithe, he can likewise designate half a grain. In this case too, when one tithes two tenths of the produce, the ruling is not that one tenth is actual tithe and the other tenth is untithed produce mixed with the tithe. Instead, half of each grain of the set-aside portion is designated as a tithe, while the other half of each grain is not. Accordingly, the remainder of the produce is tithed, as one tenth of the total has been designated as first tithe. However, the portion designated as the tithe is ruined, because it is impossible to identify which part of each grain is designated. 
Another objection was raised against Rabba’s opinion: Yet there is the case of the <span class="gemarra-regular">animal tithe, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which does take effect partially, </span>as one cannot consecrate half an animal for his tithe. Three times a year, the owner of a herd of kosher animals would gather all the animals born during the preceding period into an enclosure and let them out one by one. Every tenth animal would be marked with red paint to indicate that it was sacred. Only an entire animal could be consecrated as animal tithe, not a part of an animal.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">emerged </span>from the enclosure together <span class="gemarra-regular">as the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tenth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he designated them </span>both as the <span class="gemarra-regular">tenth,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the tenth and eleventh </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">are intermingled with each other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>One is sacred with the sanctity of the animal tithe, while the other remains a peace-offering, but there is no way to determine which is which. The question arises: If the principle that anything which cannot be accomplished sequentially; even simultaneously it cannot be accomplished applies, neither animal is consecrated, as one cannot designate both the tenth and the eleventh animals as the animal tithe, one after the other.
The Gemara answers: The <span class="gemarra-regular">animal tithe is different, as </span>two animals can indeed be designated as animal tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">one after the other in</span> the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an error. </span>Although one cannot designate the tenth and eleventh animals as the animal tithe <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, if he did so in error they are both consecrated. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>erred and <span class="gemarra-regular">designated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the ninth </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">as the tenth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and erred again and designated <span class="gemarra-regular">the tenth as the ninth and the eleventh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as the tenth, </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">are consecrated. </span>The first is consecrated because it was designated as the tenth, the second because it actually is the tenth, while the third is also consecrated because it was designated as the tenth. Apparently, more than one animal can be consecrated as the animal tithe, if designated in error. Here too, a modicum of sanctity applies to the two animals that emerged together and were together designated as the tenth.
The Gemara raises another objection to Rabba’s principle. <span class="gemarra-regular">But there is </span>the case of the forty loaves that accompany a <span class="gemarra-regular">thanks-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which are not </span>consecrated if they were designated <span class="gemarra-regular">in error</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">are not</span> consecrated if two sets of loaves were designated for the same offering <span class="gemarra-regular">one after the other. And </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated </span>that <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a thanks</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offering that was slaughtered </span>accompanied <span class="gemarra-regular">by eighty loaves, </span>twice the required amount. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥizkiya said: Forty of the eighty </span>loaves <span class="gemarra-regular">are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> consecrated, </span>even though their identity cannot be determined; <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan said: Not </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">forty of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">eighty </span>loaves <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated. </span>It would appear that these <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagree whether or not sanctity that cannot take effect in sequence can take effect simultaneously. 
The Gemara rejects this contention. <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it stated with regard to </span>this dispute that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: Everyone, </span>both Ḥizkiya and Rabbi Yoḥanan, <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes </span>that in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the donor <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Let forty </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the eighty </span>loaves <span class="gemarra-regular">be consecrated, that </span>the forty <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated; </span>and in a case where he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let forty </span>loaves <span class="gemarra-regular">only be consecrated if </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">eighty are consecrated, everyone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">agrees that they are not consecrated. </span>This is in accordance with Rabba’s opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Ḥizkiya and Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree </span>is with regard a case where the donor designated eighty loaves <span class="gemarra-regular">without stipulation </span>how many he wants consecrated. <span class="gemarra-regular">One Sage, </span>Ḥizkiya, <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains: </span>Although he designated eighty loaves, he seeks to consecrate only forty, and when he sets aside eighty loaves, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">intends to ensure </span>that he will have forty, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">brought </span>the extra loaves <span class="gemarra-regular">on condition </span>that if the first forty loaves are lost or become ritually impure, the second forty will be consecrated in their place. Consequently, the first forty loaves are consecrated. 

Daf 50b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And the other Sage, </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan, <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains: </span>He <span class="gemarra-regular">intends</span> to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a large offering </span>of eighty loaves, and therefore none of the loaves are consecrated.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: They only taught </span>Rav’s ruling that one cannot establish residence beneath a tree without precisely defining a particular location, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a tree beneath which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there are </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve cubits. However, with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a tree </span>beneath <span class="gemarra-regular">which there are not twelve cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he can establish residence there, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">part of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his residence is conspicuous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In that case, there is a partial overlap between the middle four cubits beneath the tree and the four cubits nearest him and the four cubits farthest from him, and consequently each necessarily contains at least part of his residence. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, strongly objects to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this: From where </span>is it ascertained <span class="gemarra-regular">that he designates </span>his residence <span class="gemarra-regular">in the four middle </span>cubits, so that there is a partial overlap with both the nearest and the farthest cubits; <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he designates </span>it in <span class="gemarra-regular">the four </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">on this side or </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the four </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> other side? </span>Since he does not know which location he designated as his residence, he did not establish residence anywhere beneath the tree.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: </span>Abaye’s statement must be emended. <span class="gemarra-regular">They taught </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a tree that </span>has at least <span class="gemarra-regular">eight cubits beneath it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. However, with regard to a tree that </span>has only <span class="gemarra-regular">seven</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits beneath it, </span>even if one did not establish a particular location, he acquires residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">part of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his residence is conspicuous, </span>as any four cubits must include at least one cubit of his residence.
With regard to the dispute between Rav and Shmuel, the Gemara notes that one <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>and another <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel.</span>
The Gemara elaborates. A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who was coming along</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the way </span>on Shabbat eve, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it grew dark </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>was traveling, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he was familiar </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tree or a fence </span>within two thousand cubits of his current location, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he said: My residence is beneath </span>that tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not said anything </span>of legal consequence. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if he said: My residence is in such-and</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-such place, he walks until he reaches that place. </span>Once <span class="gemarra-regular">he reached that place </span>that he established as his residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">he walks </span>through <span class="gemarra-regular">all of it and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits beyond it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">In what</span> case <span class="gemarra-regular">are these matters, </span>that he establishes four cubits as his residence, and another two thousand cubits in each direction, <span class="gemarra-regular">stated? </span>In a case where he selected <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>well-<span class="gemarra-regular">defined</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>clearly demarcated <span class="gemarra-regular">place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> established </span>residence <span class="gemarra-regular">on a mound ten handbreadths high, and its</span> area ranges <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a minimum of <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits to </span>a maximum of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And, likewise, </span>that is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> when he establishes residence on <span class="gemarra-regular">a plain ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">deeper </span>than the surrounding area, <span class="gemarra-regular">and its </span>area ranges <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a minimum of <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits to </span>a maximum of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. However, </span>if he selected <span class="gemarra-regular">a place that is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> defined, </span>e.g., in the middle of a plain, he does not establish residence, and accordingly <span class="gemarra-regular">he has only four</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits </span>in which to move.
<span class="gemarra-regular">If two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>walking together, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of whom is <span class="gemarra-regular">familiar </span>with a particular location in the distance, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>of whom is <span class="gemarra-regular">not familiar</span> with it, <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not familiar </span>with it <span class="gemarra-regular">entrusts </span>his right to designate <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>residence <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not familiar </span>with it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one who </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">familiar </span>with it <span class="gemarra-regular">says: My residence is in such-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">and-such place.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">are these matters, </span>that he acquires four cubits as his residence and another two thousand cubits in each direction, <span class="gemarra-regular">stated? </span>In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he defined</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits that he </span>seeks to <span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span>as his residence. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not define </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that he </span>seeks to <span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span>as his residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not move from his </span>current <span class="gemarra-regular">place, </span>as neither did he seek to establish residence there, nor did he acquire it in the location he sought to establish residence. This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rav opinion that one who fails to designate the four cubits he seeks to establish as residence has no residence at all.
Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is a <span class="gemarra-regular">conclusive</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel? </span>The Gemara answers: There is no difficulty, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span>special <span class="gemarra-regular">case, where from the place he is standing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the trunk </span>of the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand and four cubits, so that if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you were to establish </span>residence <span class="gemarra-regular">on the other side of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the tree, it would be situated outside </span>his Shabbat limit. 
Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he designated </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>on the near side of the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">he may go </span>there; <span class="gemarra-regular">and if not, he may not go </span>from the place he is standing. In other words, since he did not establish residence in a particular location, the concern is that he sought to establish it beyond his two thousand cubit limit.
A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel. If one erred and established </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in two direction</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> at once, for example, if in his ignorance <span class="gemarra-regular">he imagined that </span>it is permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in two directions, </span>that he may extend the distance that he may walk on Shabbat in two opposite directions, <span class="gemarra-regular">or if he said to his servants: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Go out and establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me, </span>without specifying the direction, and <span class="gemarra-regular">one established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for him to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the north, and one established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for him to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the south, he may walk to the north as </span>far as he is permitted go based on <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the south, </span>and he may walk <span class="gemarra-regular">to the south as </span>far as he is permitted go based on <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to the north. </span>In other words, the assumption is that he established residence in both directions based on the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in each direction, and he must therefore take both into consideration before moving.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>each <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was placed two thousand cubits in opposite directions <span class="gemarra-regular">placing him in the middle of the limit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not move from his </span>current <span class="gemarra-regular">location, </span>as it is prohibited to venture beyond either limit. Apparently, even if one did not establish residence in a particular location, as in this case he has acquired residence in both places, nonetheless, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that residence has been established in his current location, in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel.
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is a <span class="gemarra-regular">conclusive</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav? </span>The Gemara answers: This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> indeed differs with Rav’s ruling. Nevertheless his opinion is not disqualified, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav himself</span> had <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> status and therefore, unlike later <span class="it-text">amora’im</span>, could <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree </span>with opinions of <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span>.
We learned in the mishna that if, however, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: My residence is at </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">trunk </span>of the tree, he established residence there, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> walk from the place that he is standing to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> trunk </span>of the tree, up to <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the trunk </span>of the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">to his house </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits. Ultimately, he may walk after nightfall </span>a total distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">four thousand cubits. </span>

Daf 51a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were he to run to the trun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> of the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">he could reach it </span>before the onset of Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to him: But doesn’t </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">state: And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it grew dark </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>was traveling, indicating that he is farther away than that?
The Gemara answers: The mishna means that <span class="gemarra-regular">it grew </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dark </span>while he was traveling so that he can no longer return <span class="gemarra-regular">to his house </span>before nightfall; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">able </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">go to the trunk </span>of the tree before Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some state </span>a different version of the previous statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The mishna means that <span class="gemarra-regular">it grew dark </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>was traveling, so that <span class="gemarra-regular">were he to walk very</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> slowly </span>he could not reach his house; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, if he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> runs, he can </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">arrive </span>before Shabbat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba and Rav Yosef were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">going </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">along the way. Rabba said to Rav Yosef: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Our residence will be beneath the palm that carries its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brother, </span>the one with another palm tree leaning on it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>he said to him: Our residence will be <span class="gemarra-regular">beneath the palm that spared its owner from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">land tax [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">karga</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the palm which yielded enough dates for its owner to pay his entire land tax. 
Rabba asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does the Master know </span>of that tree? Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>No, <span class="gemarra-regular">I do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not know </span>of it. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: </span>Then <span class="gemarra-regular">rely</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on me, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: If two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>walking together, <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span> of whom is <span class="gemarra-regular">familiar </span>with a particular location in the distance, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not familiar </span>with it, <span class="gemarra-regular">the one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not familiar </span>with it <span class="gemarra-regular">entrusts </span>his right to designate <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>residence <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">familiar </span>with it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one who </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">familiar </span>with it <span class="gemarra-regular">says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: My residence is in such-and-such place.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">But it is not</span> so; that is not the opinion of Rabbi Yosei. Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">only taught it </span>as if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei so that </span>Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">would accept it from him, due to </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei’s reasoning </span>accompanies <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>rulings, Since the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is usually in accordance with Rav Yosei’s opinion, Rav Yosef would be less likely to raise doubts with regard to the ruling. 
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If one is not familiar</span> with a tree or any other noticeable landmark, <span class="gemarra-regular">or if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he is not an expert </span>in the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, unaware that residence can be established from a distance, and he said: My residence is at my current location, his presence at his current location acquires for him the right to walk two thousand cubits in each direction.
The Gemara raises a fundamental question: <span class="gemarra-regular">These two thousand cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, where are </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>in the Torah? The Gemara answers that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Remain every man in his place” </span>(Exodus 16:29); <span class="gemarra-regular">these are </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits, </span>which constitute the minimum Shabbat limit, e.g., for one who ventured beyond his prescribed limit. <span class="gemarra-regular">“Let no man go out of his place” </span>(Exodus 16:29); <span class="gemarra-regular">these are </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits </span>of the Shabbat limit for one who remains in his place. Unless otherwise specified, the measure of one’s place is two thousand cubits.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do we </span>derive that this is the measure of one’s place? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: We derive </span>this by means of a verbal analogy between the term <span class="gemarra-regular">place</span> written here: “Let no man go out of his place,” and <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">plac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> written with regard to an unwitting murderer: “Then I will appoint you a place to where he shall flee” (Exodus 21:13). This last verse mentions both place and fleeing, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">fleeing. And </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">fleeing </span>is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">fleeing, </span>written in a different verse with regard to the unwitting murderer: “But if the slayer shall at any time come outside the border of the city of his refuge, whither he has fled” (Numbers 35:26). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">fleeing </span>is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">border</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which appears in the same verse. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">border </span>is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">border, </span>as it states there: “And the avenger of blood find him outside [<span class="it-text">miḥutz</span>] the borders of the city of his refuge” (Numbers 35:27). Since this verse mentions both the term border and the term outside, the term <span class="gemarra-regular">border </span>is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">outside. And </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">outside, as it is written </span>with regard to the Levite cities, which also served as cities of refuge: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall measure from outside [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">miḥutz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the city on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> east side two thousand cubits, </span>and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits” (Numbers 35:5). From this chain of identical terms, the meaning of the term place stated in connection with Shabbat is derived from the two thousand cubits mentioned with regard to the Levite cities. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let us</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> derive </span>instead by means of a verbal analogy between the term outside in the verse: “Outside the borders of the city of refuge,” and the term outside in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“From the wall of the city outward [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vaḥutza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a thousand cubits” </span>(Numbers 35:4), that the Shabbat limit measures only a thousand cubits. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">One derives </span>the meaning of the term <span class="gemarra-regular">outside [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥutz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>by means of a verbal analogy <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>another instance of the term <span class="gemarra-regular">outside</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥutz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], but one does not derive </span>the meaning of the term <span class="gemarra-regular">outside from </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">outward [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥutza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>significant about <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> difference </span>between the two terms? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t the school of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yishmael teach </span>a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses between the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the priest shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">return [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">veshav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Leviticus 14:39) and the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">priest shall come [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">uva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Leviticus 14:44), from which it is derived that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">returning</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., it is after seven days; <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">coming; </span>it is after seven days. Obviously, the less pronounced difference of one letter between <span class="it-text">ḥutz</span> and <span class="it-text">ḥutza</span>, should not prevent the teaching of a verbal analogy.
Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-regular">applies </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">when there are no terms </span>that are <span class="gemarra-regular">identical </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to it however, where there are terms </span>that are <span class="gemarra-regular">identical </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to it, we derive </span>the verbal analogy <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>terms <span class="gemarra-regular">identical </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to it, </span>rather than from the terms that are not precisely identical. 
The <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> of the mishna disagree whether the <span class="gemarra-regular">two-thousand-cubit </span>limit granted to a person in every direction is measured as a <span class="gemarra-regular">circle </span>or as a square tablet. The Gemara poses a question: With regard to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigenos </span>that the limit is measured as a circle, <span class="gemarra-regular">no matter what</span> you say, it is difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">If he is of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>opinion that there is a <span class="gemarra-regular">verbal analogy </span>from the verse written with regard to the Levite cities it is difficult, because <span class="gemarra-regular">sides </span>is the term <span class="gemarra-regular">written, </span>indicating squared boundaries. And <span class="gemarra-regular">if he is not of the </span>opinion that there is a <span class="gemarra-regular">verbal analogy, from where does he </span>derive that the Shabbat limit is <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits?</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, he is of </span>the opinion that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verbal analogy, but here, </span>with regard to the Levite cities, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is different, as the verse says: “This shall be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to them the open space of the cities” </span>(Numbers 35:5), from which it is inferred: <span class="gemarra-regular">To this, </span>the open space of the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">provide sides </span>and square it, <span class="gemarra-regular">but you do not provide sides to those resting </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat. </span>Instead, those who establish Shabbat residence are provided with a circular, two-thousand-cubit limit. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how do <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>understand the emphasis placed on the word this in the verse? The Gemara answers: As <span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥananya says: Like this </span>measure <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be </span>the calculations of measures for <span class="gemarra-regular">all those who rest on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., square.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: One who carries</span> an object <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits in the public domain is only</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> liable if he carries </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">with their diagonal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The four cubits mentioned in many places is only the basic measure by which the distance beyond which it is prohibited to carry is calculated. However, in practice, a person is liable only if he carries the object the length of the diagonal of a square with four-cubit sides. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">tested us</span> by asking: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a pillar in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> public domain, ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high and four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide, must</span> the width <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span>four handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">with their diagonal </span>in order to be regarded a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">or not</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And we said to him: Is this not </span>that which was taught by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥananya? As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥananya says: Like this </span>measure <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">all those who rest on Shabbat, </span>indicating that the diagonal is the determining measure for the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of rest on Shabbat. 
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said: A pauper can establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his feet, </span>i.e., one who does not have the bread required to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may walk anywhere within his Shabbat limit and acquire residence. <span class="gemarra-regular">We have </span>this leniency in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a pauper, </span>who does not have food for two meals. However, one who has bread may only establish residence with bread. Rabbi Yehuda says: This leniency is in effect for both a pauper and a wealthy person.  
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case where the person said: My residence is in <span class="gemarra-regular">my </span>current <span class="gemarra-regular">location. As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir maintains: The primary </span>ordinance and establishment <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">with bread. </span>

Daf 51b

Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a pauper, </span>who does not have food for two meals, <span class="gemarra-regular">that the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sages were lenient </span>and permitted him to establish residence merely by saying: My residence is in my current location. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a wealthy person </span>in his own house who has bread, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>they did not permit him to do so. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda maintains: The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">primary </span>ordinance <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is by foot, </span>i.e., by going and stating that he is establishing his residence in that location, and therefore it applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">both a pauper</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a wealthy person. However, </span>with regard a case when the person said: My residence is <span class="gemarra-regular">in such-and-such</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> place, </span>and he is not there, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone, </span>both Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">agrees </span>that for <span class="gemarra-regular">a pauper </span>on the road on a Shabbat eve, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, an </span><span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may be established in that manner; however, for <span class="gemarra-regular">a wealthy person, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>an eiruv may not be established in that manner. 
And as for the mishna’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is what </span>the Sages meant when <span class="gemarra-regular">they said </span>that a pauper can establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with his feet,<span class="gemarra-regular">who, </span>which Sage, <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching it? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir. And to which </span>clause of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is it referring? </span>It refers to the previous statement: If he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not familiar </span>with a tree or any other noticeable landmark, <span class="gemarra-regular">or if he is not an expert in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and therefore is unaware that a residence can be established from a distance, and said: My residence is in my current location, he acquires two thousand cubits in each direction. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for the statement in the continuation of the mishna: The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one establishes an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with bread only to be lenient with the wealthy</span> person,<span class="gemarra-regular">who, </span>which Sage, <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching it? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who maintains that the option of establishing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> by foot is available to the wealthy as well. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda, </span>however, disagreed with Rav Naḥman and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda in the mishna is with regard to a person who said: My residence is <span class="gemarra-regular">in such-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">and-such place, </span>in which case the his residence is neither acquired by foot nor with bread.  <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Meir </span><span class="gemarra-regular">maintains: A pauper, yes, </span>he establishes residence with an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in that manner; however, <span class="gemarra-regular">a wealthy person, no, </span>he does not. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda maintains: Both a pauper and a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wealthy person </span>may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in that manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>in a case where one said: My residence is <span class="gemarra-regular">in my </span>present <span class="gemarra-regular">location, everyone, </span>both Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">agrees </span>that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> of this kind is effective <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a pauper and </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a wealthy person, </span>as everyone agrees agree that <span class="gemarra-regular">the primary </span>ordinance <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by foot.</span>
And as for the mishna’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is what </span>the Sages meant when <span class="gemarra-regular">they said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a pauper </span>can establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> by foot, <span class="gemarra-regular">who is teaching it? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir. And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to which </span>clause of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is it referring? </span>It is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to this </span>clause: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who was coming along</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the way </span>on Shabbat eve, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it grew dark </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>was traveling. According to Rabbi Yehuda, he could have established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> even if he was in his house. And as for the statement in the continuation of the mishna: The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one establishes an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with bread only </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to be lenient with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wealthy </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">who is teaching it? Everyone agrees </span>with this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, and it is taught according to both opinions. 
The Gemara comments: A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman, </span>who said that the dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda is with regard to one who said: My residence is in my present location. It was stated in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Both a pauper and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a wealthy person establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with bread; however a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wealthy person may not go out beyond the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and say: My residence is in my </span>present <span class="gemarra-regular">location, because</span> the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one can establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> foot only </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person who was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> coming along the way and it grew dark </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span> was traveling. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Both a pauper and a wealthy person establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">by foot. And a wealthy person will go out beyond </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit and say: My residence is in my </span>present <span class="gemarra-regular">location. And this is the primary </span>ordinance <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> However, the Sages permitted a homeowner to send his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the hand of his servant, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hand of his son, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">in the hand of his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">agent, </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to be lenient with him, </span>so that he need not exert himself and go out and establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> by foot. This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> presents the dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda as it was delineated by Rav Naḥman. 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> incident involving the members of the household of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Memel</span> family <span class="gemarra-regular">and members of the household of Guryon </span>family <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span> the village of <span class="gemarra-regular">Aroma, who were distributing dried figs and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raisins to the paupers in years of famine, and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> paupers of the village of Siḥin and the paupers of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the village of Ḥananya would come </span>to the edge of the Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit at nightfall, </span>which was also within the Shabbat limit of Aroma, and then go home. <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> following day they would rise early and go </span>to receive their figs and raisins. Apparently, one can establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> by foot, if he says: My residence is in my present location.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: The </span>formulation of the <span class="gemarra-regular">mishna is also precise</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in accordance with Rav Naḥman’s explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: If </span>on a Shabbat eve <span class="gemarra-regular">one set out to go</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a city for which an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is established </span>enabling him to go there on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">caused</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him to return </span>home, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to go</span> to that city on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">all the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">residents of the town it is prohibited </span>to go there. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we discussed </span>this mishna and raised a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">him and what is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">them? </span>Why is he permitted to proceed to the other town while it is prohibited for the other residents to do so? <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Huna said: We are dealing here with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he has </span>two <span class="gemarra-regular">houses, </span>one in each city, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there is the distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">two Shabbat limits, </span>four thousand cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">between them.</span>
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">him, since he set out on his way, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pauper, </span>as he did not intended to return to his first house, but to continue to his other house. Therefore, he can establish residence at the end of his Shabbat limit by verbal means alone. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>other inhabitants of his city, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">wealthy people, </span>as they are in their houses and have food. Consequently they can only establish residence at the end of their Shabbat limit by depositing food there prior the onset of Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, everything </span>stated with regard to one who says: My residence is <span class="gemarra-regular">in such-and-such place; </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pauper, yes, </span>it applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">a wealthy person, no, </span>it does not apply. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from this</span> that this is the case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was teaching </span>the mishna to <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥiyya bar Rav before Rav.</span> He stated that this leniency applies <span class="gemarra-regular">both to a pauper</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and to a wealthy person. Rav said to him: Conclude</span> your statement <span class="gemarra-regular">also: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda.</span>
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan was in the habit</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">coming from </span>his home in <span class="gemarra-regular">Artibben</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Pumbedita </span>on Shabbat. 

Daf 52a

He <span class="gemarra-regular">would declare </span>on Shabbat eve: <span class="gemarra-regular">My residence is in Tzinta, </span>a settlement located between the Shabbat limits of the two places. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">What is your opinion </span>that led you to act in that manner? Is it because in a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, and Rav Ḥisda said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>between these two Sages is in a case where the person said: My residence is <span class="gemarra-regular">in such-and-such </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place, </span>and you rely on Rabbi Yehuda and establish residence at a place between the two cities even though you are still at home? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rav Naḥman </span>explain the dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda differently, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>furthermore, a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught in accordance with his </span>opinion. Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I retract </span>my opinion and will no longer do so. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama said: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">have said </span>that one who <span class="gemarra-regular">establishes </span>residence by foot <span class="gemarra-regular">has four cubits </span>at that location, and another two thousand cubits beyond. However, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who deposits his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> in a certain place, there is a dilemma whether he <span class="gemarra-regular">has four </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits </span>from the site of his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">or not.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution from the mishna: The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">establishes an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with bread only to be lenient with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the wealthy </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that he </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>exert himself and <span class="gemarra-regular">go out and establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his feet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And if you say </span>that one who establishes an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with bread <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have </span>four cubits, is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">a leniency? It is a stringency. </span>Based on the mishna, apparently, all leniencies that apply to one who establishes an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> by foot must also apply to one who establishes an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with bread.
The Gemara rejects this argument: No proof can be cited from there, as <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if he without the four cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is preferable to him, so that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">not exert himself and go out </span>and establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> by foot. Therefore, it can be said that establishing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with bread constitutes a leniency even if it entails the loss of four cubits.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">a person set out to g</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> on a Shabbat eve <span class="gemarra-regular">to a town for which an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is established</span> in order to go there on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">caused him to return </span>home, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> go </span>to that city on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">residents of the town it is prohibited </span>to go there. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: Anyone who can establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and negated his residence in his original place, <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., he did not at least state that he seeks to establish residence somewhere else, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>likened to both <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey driver, </span>who walks behind the animal and prods it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a camel driver, </span>who walks before the animal and leads it, in the sense that he is pulled in two opposite directions. Due to the uncertainty with regard to the location of his Shabbat limit, his movement is restricted as though his residence was established in both his city and at a location along the way to the other city. He may not venture beyond two thousand cubits from either location.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s statement that according to Rabbi Yehuda, he himself is permitted to go to the other city, while for all the rest of the residents of his city it is prohibited to do so, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">him and what is different</span> about <span class="gemarra-regular">them? </span>Why is he permitted to proceed to the other city, while they are not? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: We</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are dealing here with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>that person <span class="gemarra-regular">has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two houses, </span>one in each town, <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">two Shabbat limits, </span>four thousand cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">between them.</span>
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">him, since he set</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out on his way, his </span>legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pauper, </span>as he did not intended to return to his first house but to continue to his other house, and he can therefore establish residence at the end of his Shabbat limit simply by declaring that he wishes to acquire residence in such-and-such place. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>other inhabitants of his city, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">wealthy people, </span>as they are in their houses and have food. Consequently they can only establish residence at the end of their Shabbat limit by depositing food there prior the onset of Shabbat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">That was also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who has two houses, with </span>the distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">two Shabbat limits between them, once he set out on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the way, </span>clearly demonstrating his intention to leave, although he did not explicitly say: My residence is at the end of my Shabbat limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">he acquired an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> there. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Furthermore, Rabbi Yosei, son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda said: Even if another found him </span>before he left, <span class="gemarra-regular">and said to him: Spend the night here, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is a hot period, </span>or it <span class="gemarra-regular">is a cold </span><span class="gemarra-regular">period </span>and inadvisable to set out now, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the following </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day he may rise early and go </span>to the other town, as his intention to walk is sufficient. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>With regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to saying </span>that he is establishing residence at the end of his Shabbat limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that this <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary, </span>as otherwise it could be understood that he is returning to his house because he changed his mind about establishing residence elsewhere. <span class="gemarra-regular">When they disagree </span>is with regard to whether or not it is necessary for him actually to <span class="gemarra-regular">set </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out </span>on his way. Rabbi Yehuda maintains that he must have set out on his way, whereas Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, maintains that he need not even set out on his way, as his intention to leave is sufficient.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yosef said: </span>With regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">setting out </span>on his way, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that this <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> necessary. Where they disagree </span>is with regard to whether or not it is necessary for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>that he is establishing his residence at the end of his Shabbat limit. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this</span> <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla stated? </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a person set out on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his way, and another persuaded him to return </span>home, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">returned and </span>as considered <span class="gemarra-regular">set out </span>on his way.
The Gemara analyzes Ulla’s statement itself: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">returned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with the same legal status as the rest of the residents of his city and has not established residence elsewhere, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>is he described as <span class="gemarra-regular">set out </span>on his way? <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>he is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">set out </span>on his way, indicating that he established residence at the end of his Shabbat limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">why is </span>he described as <span class="gemarra-regular">returned?</span>
The Gemara answers: Emend Ulla’s statement and explain that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">he is saying: Although he was returned</span> to his original place, he is nonetheless regarded as having <span class="gemarra-regular">set out </span>on his way. <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion did he state this ruling? <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef, </span>that everyone agrees he must set out on his way, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that he need not declare he is establishing his residence at the end of his Shabbat limit.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda bar Ishtata </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">brought a basket </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of fruit to Rav Natan bar Oshaya </span>in a nearby town, four thousand cubits away, on Shabbat eve. <span class="gemarra-regular">When he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was going, </span>Rav Natan <span class="gemarra-regular">left him until he descended one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">step, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Lodge here </span>tonight. He allowed him start his journey so that he would be considered as having set out on his way. <span class="gemarra-regular">On the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> following day </span>Rav Yehuda bar Ishtata <span class="gemarra-regular">rose early and went</span> home. 

Daf 52b

The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion did Rav Natan bar Oshaya act? Apparently, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef </span>that everyone agrees that he must set out on his way, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda </span>that he need not declare that he is establishing his residence at the end of his Shabbat limit.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">No</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>that is not necessarily so, as it is possible to say that he acted <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>and Rav Yehuda bar Ishtata declared that he establishes his residence at the end of his Shabbat limit. 
We learned in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meir says: Anyone who can establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and negated his residence in his original place, and did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, is likened to both a donkey driver and a camel driver. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">once </span>before in another mishna: In a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty, Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>likened to both <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey driver </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a camel driver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Here too, it is obvious that the same applies, as that is Rabbi Meir’s opinion with regard to all uncertain cases.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>It is necessary to state this ruling here as well, so that <span class="gemarra-regular">you will not say the reason </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir’s </span>statement only applies in a case where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty whether </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>in likened to both <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey driver </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a camel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">driver. However, </span>in a case where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">certainty </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he is not </span>likened to both <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey driver </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a camel driver, </span>but his Shabbat limit is the same as the rest of the residents of his city.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>say that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in a case where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">certainty </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> he is sometimes likened to both <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">donkey driver </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a camel driver, as here he certainly </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>likened to both <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey driver </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a camel driver. </span>It was therefore necessary to state that even in that case, where there is no uncertainty whether or not he established the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, but only with regard to the location of his residence, he nonetheless has the status of both a donkey driver and a camel driver.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who </span>intentionally, not for the purpose of performing a mitzva, <span class="gemarra-regular">went out beyond </span>his Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>cubit, <span class="gemarra-regular">may not reenter. Rabbi Eliezer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>If he went out <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">he may reenter; </span>however, if he went out <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reenter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one of his feet was within </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, and his other foot was beyond the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, he may not reenter, as it is written: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">If you turn away your feet [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">raglekha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] due to Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> (Isaiah 58:13). The word <span class="it-text">raglekha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>in defective form without the letter <span class="it-text">yod</span>, and can therefore be read as <span class="gemarra-regular">your foot </span>in the singular, indicating that Shabbat can be desecrated by the reentry of even a single foot.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t </span>the opposite <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? If <span class="gemarra-regular">one of his feet was within the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and his other foot was beyond the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may reenter. </span>The Gemara answers: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span>taught? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: He is attributed to the place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where the majority of his body </span>lies, and therefore, it is permitted for him to enter, as he stepped out with only one foot. 
The Gemara cites a different version of the previous discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one of his feet was within</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, and his other foot was beyond the</span> Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, he may reenter, as it is written: “If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you turn away your feet due to Shabbat” </span>(Isaiah 58:13). <span class="gemarra-regular">We read </span>the word <span class="it-text">raglekha</span> as <span class="gemarra-regular">your feet, </span>in the plural, indicating that the entry of a single foot is permitted. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wasn’t </span>the opposite <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">He may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not reenter? </span>The Gemara answers: Rabbi Ḥanina <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">He is attributed to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> place where the majority of his body </span>is located, and it is therefore permitted to enter, as most of his body remains within the Shabbat limit. 
We learned in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>If he went out <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">he may reenter; </span>however, if he went out <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not reenter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it taught </span>otherwise in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>If he went out <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">he may reenter; </span>however, if he went out <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not reenter. </span>The Gemara answers: That is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a difficulty. This, </span>the mishna, is referring to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he moved </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>cubit <span class="gemarra-regular">and is </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">standing two </span>cubits out, and therefore it is permitted for him to reenter; <span class="gemarra-regular">however that, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, is referring to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he moved </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>cubit <span class="gemarra-regular">and is </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">standing three </span>cubits out. Consequently, it is prohibited for him to reenter. 
The Gemara raises another difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it taught </span>in a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: Even </span>if he went <span class="gemarra-regular">one cubit </span>out, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not enter. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span>it was with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one measuring </span>his limit by counting two thousand steps. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>established residence in a particular place, and <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">measuring </span>his limit by counting out steps, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to whom </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> provides him </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits, even if his measurement</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ended in a cave </span>he may not walk even one cubit beyond his measurement. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">whom it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> grew dar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> while he was traveling <span class="gemarra-regular">outside the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit </span>of the town where he was heading,<span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if he was only <span class="gemarra-regular">one cubit </span>outside the limit <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may not enter </span>the town. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: Even </span>if he was <span class="gemarra-regular">fifteen cubits </span>beyond the limit <span class="gemarra-regular">he may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span>the town, <span class="gemarra-regular">because the surveyors do not precisely demarcate</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the measures; </span>rather, they mark the Shabbat limit within the two thousand cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to those who err</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s statement: Due to those who err, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Due to those who err in their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> measurement. </span>In other words, because the surveyors are concerned that they might have erred in their measurements, they are stringent and do not position the mark at the edge of the limit, but move it several cubits within the limit. 

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">How does one extend </span>the boundaries of <span class="gemarra-regular">cities </span>in order to ensure that all its protrusions are included within the borders of the city? He extends a straight line across the edge of the city, and if <span class="gemarra-regular">a house </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is recessed and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">house protrudes, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">a turret [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pagum</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is recessed and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">turret protrudes </span>from that line, and similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">there were remnants </span>of walls <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths </span><span class="gemarra-regular">high, </span>

Daf 53a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and bridges and monuments </span>over graves <span class="gemarra-regular">in which there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a residence, one extends the measure </span>of that side of the city as though there were other structures <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite them</span> in the adjacent corner of the city. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>prior to measuring the Shabbat limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">one renders </span>the city <span class="gemarra-regular">like a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> square tablet so that it gains the corners, </span>although there are actually no houses in those corners. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara cites a dispute with regard to the mishna’s terminology. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Shmuel </span>disagreed: <span class="gemarra-regular">One taught </span>that the term in the mishna is <span class="gemarra-italic">me’abberin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with the letter <span class="it-text">ayin</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>that the term in the mishna is <span class="gemarra-italic">me’abberin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with the letter <span class="it-text">alef</span>. 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who taught</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">me’abberin</span> with an <span class="it-text">alef</span> explained the term in the sense of <span class="gemarra-regular">limb </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">ever</span>] by <span class="gemarra-regular">limb. </span>Determination of the city’s borders involves the addition of limbs to the core section of the city. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the one who taught</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">me’abberin</span> with an <span class="it-text">ayin</span> explained the term in the sense of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pregnant </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woman</span> [<span class="gemarra-italic">ubbera</span>] whose belly protrudes. In similar fashion, all the city’s protrusions are incorporated in its Shabbat limit.
Apropos this dispute, the Gemara cites similar disputes between Rav and Shmuel. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Machpelah Cave, </span>in which the Patriarchs and Matriarchs are buried, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel </span>disagreed. <span class="gemarra-regular">One said: </span>The cave consists of <span class="gemarra-regular">two rooms, one </span>farther <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>than <span class="gemarra-regular">the other. And one said: </span>It consists of <span class="gemarra-regular">a room and </span>a second <span class="gemarra-regular">story above it.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>this is understandable <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who said </span>the cave consists of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>room <span class="gemarra-regular">above the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> other, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">that is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">Machpelah, double. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to the one who said </span>it consists of <span class="gemarra-regular">two rooms, one </span>farther <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>than <span class="gemarra-regular">the other, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>sense is it <span class="gemarra-regular">Machpelah? </span>Even ordinary houses contain two rooms.
Rather, it is called Machpelah in the sense <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is doubled with </span>the Patriarchs and Matriarchs, who are buried there <span class="gemarra-regular">in pairs. </span>This is similar to the homiletic interpretation of the alternative name for Hebron mentioned in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Mamre </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Kiryat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ha’Arba, </span>which is Hebron” (Genesis 35:27). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The city is called Kiryat Ha’Arba, the city of four, because it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the city of the four </span><span class="gemarra-regular">couples </span>buried there: <span class="gemarra-regular">Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Rebecca, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Jacob and Leah. </span>
They disagreed about this verse as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it came to pass in the days of Amraphel” </span>(Genesis 14:1). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel </span>both identified Amraphel with Nimrod. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">one said: Nimrod was his name. And why was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his name called Amraphel? </span>It is a contraction of two Hebrew words: <span class="gemarra-regular">As he said [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">amar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>the command <span class="gemarra-regular">and cast [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hippil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] our father Abraham into the fiery furnace, </span>when Abraham rebelled against and challenged his proclaimed divinity. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Amraphel was his name. And why was his name </span><span class="gemarra-regular">called Nimrod? Because he caused the entire world to rebel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">himrid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> against <span class="gemarra-regular">God during his reign. </span>
They also disagreed about this verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“There arose a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> new king over Egypt, </span>who knew not Joseph” (Exodus 1:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel </span>disagreed. <span class="gemarra-regular">One said: </span>He was <span class="gemarra-regular">actually </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">new </span>king, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one said: </span>He was in fact the old king, but <span class="gemarra-regular">his decrees were new. </span>
The Gemara explains. <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who said </span>he was <span class="gemarra-regular">actually </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">new </span>king based his opinion on the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is written </span>in the verse that he was <span class="gemarra-regular">new. And the one who said that his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> decrees were new </span>derived his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is not written: And </span>the king <span class="gemarra-regular">died, and </span>his successor <span class="gemarra-regular">reigned, </span>as it is written, for example, with regard to the kings of Edom (Genesis 36). 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the one who said that his decrees </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were new, isn’t it written: “Who knew not Joseph”? </span>If it were the same king, how could he not know Joseph? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Who knew not Joseph”? </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">that he</span> conducted himself <span class="gemarra-regular">like one who did not know Joseph at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all.</span>
The Gemara cites a <span class="gemarra-regular">mnemonic </span>of key words from a series of traditions cited below: <span class="gemarra-regular">Eighteen and twelv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we studied, with regard to David, and he will understand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spent eighteen days with Rabbi Oshay</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Distinguished [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Beribbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and I learned from him only one matter in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">our Mishna. </span>In the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">How does one extend cities</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the word <span class="it-text">me’abberin</span> is spelled <span class="gemarra-regular">with an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">alef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this so? Didn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Rabbi Oshaya the Distinguished had twelve </span><span class="gemarra-regular">students, and I spent eighteen days among them, and I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned the heart of each and every one, </span>i.e., the nature and character of each student, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span>extent of the <span class="gemarra-regular">wisdom of each and every one? </span>How could Rabbi Yoḥanan say that he learned only one matter?
The Gemara answers: It is possible that <span class="gemarra-regular">he learned</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the heart of each and every one and the wisdom</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of each and every one, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not learn</span> substantive <span class="gemarra-regular">tradition. </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the students <span class="gemarra-regular">themselves he learned </span>many things; <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>Rabbi Oshaya <span class="gemarra-regular">himself he did not learn </span>anything beyond that one matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead: Rabbi Yoḥanan meant to <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that he learned only one matter <span class="gemarra-regular">in our </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Mishna </span>from Rabbi Oshaya, but he learned other matters from him based on <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> and other sources.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said </span>about that period: <span class="gemarra-regular">When we were studying Torah with Rabbi Oshaya,</span> it was so crowded with students that <span class="gemarra-regular">we would sit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four in each </span>square <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit. </span>Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: When we were studying Torah with Rabbi Elazar ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shamua, we would sit six in each </span>square <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan said </span>about his teacher: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Oshaya the Distinguished </span>was as great <span class="gemarra-regular">in his generation as Rabbi Meir </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his generation: Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his generation his colleagues were unable to fully grasp </span>the profundity of <span class="gemarra-regular">his thinking </span>due to the subtlety of his great mind, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>it was with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Oshaya; his colleagues </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were unable to fully grasp </span>the profundity of <span class="gemarra-regular">his thinking.</span>
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The hearts, </span>i.e., the wisdom, <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">early </span>Sages were <span class="gemarra-regular">like the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> doorway to the Entrance Hall </span>of the Temple, which was twenty by forty cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the hearts <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">later</span> Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">were like the doorway to the Sanctuary, </span>which was ten by twenty cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we, </span>i.e., our hearts, <span class="gemarra-regular">are like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">eye of a fine needle. </span>
He explains: The term <span class="gemarra-regular">early </span>Sages is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>and the term <span class="gemarra-regular">later </span>Sages is referring to his student, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua. Some say </span>that the term <span class="gemarra-regular">early </span>Sages refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua </span>and that the term the <span class="gemarra-regular">later </span>Sages refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Oshaya the Distinguished. And we are like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">eye of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a fine needle.</span>
On the topic of the steady decline of the generations, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: And we, </span>as far as our capabilities are concerned, <span class="gemarra-regular">are like a peg in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the wal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">study. </span>Just as a peg enters a wall with difficulty, our studies penetrate our minds only with difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: And we are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">like a finger in wax [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">logical reasoning. </span>A finger is not easily pushed into wax, and it extracts nothing from the wax. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">We are like a finger in a pit with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to forgetfulness. </span>Just as a finger easily enters a large pit, similarly, we quickly forget our studies.
The Gemara continues the discussion relating to study and comprehension, and cites that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that Rav said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the people of Judea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who were particular in their speech </span>and always made certain that it was both precise and refined, <span class="gemarra-regular">their Torah </span>knowledge <span class="gemarra-regular">endured for them; </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the people of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Galilee, who were not particular in their speech, their Torah</span> knowledge <span class="gemarra-regular">did not endure for them.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">matter at all dependent on </span>being <span class="gemarra-regular">particular </span>with one’s language? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the people </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Judea, who were precise in their language and </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">would formulate mnemonic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> for their studies, <span class="gemarra-regular">their Torah </span>knowledge <span class="gemarra-regular">endured</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for them; </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the people of the Galilee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who were not precise in their language and </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not formulate mnemonics, their Torah </span>knowledge <span class="gemarra-regular">did not endure for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them.</span>
Furthermore, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the people of Judea, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">studied</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from one teacher, their Torah </span>knowledge <span class="gemarra-regular">endured for them, </span>as their teacher provided them with a consistent approach; however, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the people of the Galilee, who did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> study from one teacher, </span>but rather from several teachers, <span class="gemarra-regular">their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Torah </span>knowledge <span class="gemarra-regular">did not endure for them, </span>as it was a combination of the approaches and opinions of a variety of Sages. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the people of Judea, who would </span>publicly <span class="gemarra-regular">disclose the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tractate </span>to be studied in the coming term so that everyone could prepare and study it in advance (<span class="it-text">ge’onim</span>), <span class="gemarra-regular">their Torah </span>knowledge <span class="gemarra-regular">endured for them; </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">people of the Galilee, who would not disclose the tractate </span>to be studied in the coming term, <span class="gemarra-regular">their Torah </span>knowledge <span class="gemarra-regular">did not endure for them. </span>
The Gemara relates that King <span class="gemarra-regular">David would disclose the tractate </span>to be studied in advance, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Saul would not disclose </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the tractate </span>to be studied. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to David, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who would disclose the tractate, it is written: “Those who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fear You will see me and be glad” </span>(Psalms 119:74), since all were prepared and could enjoy his Torah. <span class="gemarra-regular">With</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to Saul, who would not disclose the tractate </span>to be studied, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And wherever he turned himself</span> 

Daf 53b

<span class="gemarra-regular">he did them </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mischief</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> (i Samuel 14:47).
The Gemara concludes the mention of Saul on a positive note. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Holy One, Blessed be He, forgave him for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that sin, </span>the massacre of Nov, the city of priests? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated </span>that the spirit of Samuel said to him: “And the Lord will also deliver Israel with you into the hand of the Philistines, <span class="gemarra-regular">and tomorrow shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you and your sons be with me” </span>(i Samuel 28:19); the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“with me” </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">within my partition </span>together with me in heaven, i.e., on the same level as the righteous prophet Samuel. 
The Gemara returns to the earlier question with regard to the correct reading of the word <span class="it-text">me’abberin</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: If there is anyone who can ask the people of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Judea, who are precise in their language, </span>whether the term in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>is <span class="gemarra-italic">me’abberin</span> with an <span class="it-text">alef</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span><span class="gemarra-italic">me’abberin</span> with an <span class="it-text">ayin</span>, he should ask them. Similarly, with regard to the blemishes of a firstborn animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>the term meaning its hindquarters that <span class="gemarra-regular">we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learned </span>in the mishna <span class="gemarra-italic">akkuzo</span> with an <span class="it-text">alef</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">or did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we learn </span><span class="gemarra-italic">akkuzo</span> with an <span class="it-text">ayin</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">They would know. </span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">One asked </span>the people of Judea, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to him: Some teach </span><span class="gemarra-italic">me’abberin</span> with an <span class="it-text">alef</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and some teach </span><span class="gemarra-italic">me’abberin</span> with an <span class="it-text">ayin</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some teach</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">akkuzo</span> with an <span class="it-text">alef</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and some teach </span><span class="gemarra-italic">akkuzo</span> with an <span class="it-text">ayin</span>. Both versions are well founded and neither one is erroneous. 
Having mentioned that <span class="gemarra-regular">the people of Judea are precise in their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> speech, </span>the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of this? The Gemara answers with an example: <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain person from Judea who said to those</span> within earshot: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have a cloak to sell. They said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: What color is your cloak? He said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them: Like beets on the ground, </span>providing an exceedingly precise description of the exact shade of the cloak, the green tint of beet greens when they first sprout. 
The Gemara returns to <span class="gemarra-regular">the people of the Galilee, who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not precise in their speech. What is </span>the meaning of this? The Gemara cites examples: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain person from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Galilee who would walk and say </span>to people: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has </span><span class="gemarra-italic">amar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Who has </span><span class="gemarra-italic">amar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? They said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Foolish Galilean, </span>what do you mean? Galileans did not pronounce the guttural letters properly, so it was unclear whether he sought <span class="gemarra-regular">a donkey [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥamor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to ride, or wine [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥamar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to drink, wool [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">amar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to wear, or a lamb [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">imar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to slaughter. </span>This is an example of the lack of precision in the Galileans’ speech.
The Gemara cites another example of the lack of linguistic precision of the Galileans: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain woman who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wanted to say to her friend: </span>My neighbor, <span class="gemarra-regular">come and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I will feed you milk [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ta’i</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">de’okhlikh</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥelba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]; </span>however, due to the imprecise articulation of her words, <span class="gemarra-regular">she said to her: My neighbor, </span>may a <span class="gemarra-regular">lioness eat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tokhlikh</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lavya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>
The Gemara cites another example of the ignorance and incivility of the Galileans: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain woman who came before a judge </span>intending to say: Master, sir [<span class="it-text">Mari kiri</span>, spelled with a <span class="it-text">kuf </span>], I had a board, and they stole it from me [<span class="it-text">tavla </span><span class="it-text">havet li ugenavuha mimeni</span>]. But instead <span class="gemarra-regular">she said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Master, servant [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Mari</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kiri</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> spelled with a <span class="it-text">kaf </span>], <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">had a beam and they stole you from me </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">tafla</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">havet</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">li</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ugenavukh</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">min</span>]. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it was so </span>large, <span class="gemarra-regular">that when they would hang you upon it, your feet </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would not reach the ground. </span>
In contrast to the speech of the Galileans, which indicates ignorance and loutishness, the Gemara cites examples of the clever phraseology of the inhabitants of Judea and the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">The maidservant in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">house of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">when she would speak </span><span class="gemarra-regular">enigmatically, </span>employing euphemistic terminology or in riddles, <span class="gemarra-regular">she would say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as follows: The ladle </span>used for drawing wine from the jug <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">knocking against </span>the bottom of <span class="gemarra-regular">the jug, </span>i.e., the wine jug is almost empty. <span class="gemarra-regular">Let the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eagles fly to their nests, </span>i.e., let the students return home, as there is nothing left for them to drink.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And when </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">wanted them to sit, she would say to them: Let </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us remove </span>the stopper <span class="gemarra-regular">from another </span>jug, <span class="gemarra-regular">and let the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ladle </span>float <span class="gemarra-regular">in the jug like a ship sailing in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the sea. </span>
The Gemara also relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rabbi Yosei bar Asyan would speak enigmatically, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would say: Prepare for me an ox in judgment on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a poor mountain. </span>His method was to construct words by combining words from Aramaic translations of Hebrew words or Hebrew translations of Aramaic words. Ox is <span class="it-text">tor</span> in Aramaic; judgment is <span class="it-text">din</span>. Combined they form <span class="it-text">teradin</span>, beets. Mountain in Hebrew is <span class="it-text">har</span>, which they pronounced <span class="it-text">ḥar</span>; poor is <span class="it-text">dal</span>. Together it spells <span class="it-text">ḥardal</span>, mustard. Thus, Rabbi Yosei bar Asyan was requesting beets in mustard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And when he would inquire about</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an inn, he would say as follows: This man here</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is raw; what is this good that there is? </span>The phrase “this man here is raw” is used in a similar syllable-by-syllable translation: Man in Hebrew is <span class="it-text">ish</span>; here is <span class="it-text">po</span>; this is <span class="it-text">zeh</span>; and raw is <span class="it-text">na</span>. All together, they sound like <span class="it-text">ushpazikhna</span>, i.e., an innkeeper (Rabbeinu Ḥananel). In other words, Rabbi Yosei bar Asyan was asking after the innkeeper.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When Rabbi Abbahu would speak enigmatically</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he would say as follows: Make the coals the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> color of an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">etrog</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; beat the golden ones</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., spread out the coals, which redden like gold when they glow; <span class="gemarra-regular">and make me two speakers-in-the-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">dark, </span>i.e., roosters, which announce the dawn when it is still dark. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>a slightly different version: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they shall make me in them, </span>on the coals, i.e., roast for me on top of the coals, <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">speakers-in-the-dark.</span>
In a similarly clever manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rabbi Abbahu: Show us [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hatzpinenu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] where Rabbi Elai</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is hiding [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzafun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>as we do not know his whereabouts. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: He rejoiced with the latter [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aḥaronit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] Aharonic [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Aharonit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] girl; she is lively [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiranit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> kept him awake [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vehiniratu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">].</span>
There are two ways to understand this cryptic statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>it refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman, </span>i.e., he married a young girl from a priestly family [Aharonic], who is his second [latter] wife, from a village [<span class="it-text">eiranit</span>], and he is sleeping now because she kept him awake during the night.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>it refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">a tractate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The term girl refers to the tractate; Aharonic indicates that it is a tractate from the order of <span class="it-text">Kodashim</span>, which deals with the priestly service. The phrase the latter means that it is his latest course of study, and lively alludes to the challenging nature of the subject matter. Since he was awake all night studying, he is presently sleeping. 
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elai: Show us where Rabbi Abbahu is hiding, </span>as we do not know where he is. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them: He has taken counsel with the one who crowns</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the <span class="it-text">Nasi</span>, who appoints the Sages, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has gone south </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">hingiv</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">to Mephibosheth, </span>i.e., he has headed to the Sages of the south, referred to here as Mephibosheth, who was King Saul’s grandson and a great Sage of his time. 
Having discussed the clever speech of various Sages, the Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">my days, no person defeated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> me </span>in a verbal encounter <span class="gemarra-regular">except for a woman, a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> young boy, and a young girl. What is </span>the encounter in which <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman </span>got the better of me? <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> time I was staying at a certain inn </span>and the hostess <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared me beans. On the first day I ate</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them and left nothing over, </span>although proper etiquette dictates that one should leave over something on his plate. On the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>day I again ate <span class="gemarra-regular">and left nothing over. </span>On the third day <span class="gemarra-regular">she over-salted them </span>so that they were inedible. <span class="gemarra-regular">As soon as I tasted </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">I withdrew</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> my hands from them.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">She said to me: My Rabbi, why aren’t you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eating </span>beans as on the previous days? Not wishing to offend her, <span class="gemarra-regular">I said to her: I have already eaten</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> during the daytime. She said to me: You should have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> withdrawn your hand from bread </span>and left room for some beans. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">She </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">said to me: My Rabbi, perhaps you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not leave a remainder </span>of food on your plate <span class="gemarra-regular">on the first </span>days, which is why you are leaving over food today. <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t this what the Sages said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: One need not leave a remainder in the po</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ilpas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but one must leave a remainder on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">plate </span>as an expression of etiquette (<span class="it-text">Tosafot</span>). This is the incident in which a woman got the better of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the incident with <span class="gemarra-regular">a young girl? One time I was walking </span><span class="gemarra-regular">along the path, and the path passed through a field, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and I was walking on it. A certain young girl </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to me: My Rabbi, isn’t this a field? </span>One should not walk through a field, so as not to damage the crops growing there. <span class="gemarra-regular">I said to her: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it a well-trodden path </span>in the field, across which one is permitted to walk? <span class="gemarra-regular">She said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me: Robbers like you have trodden it. </span>In other words, it previously had been prohibited to walk through this field, and it is only due to people such as you, who paid no attention to the prohibition, that a path has been cut across it. Thus, the young girl defeated Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya in a debate.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the incident with <span class="gemarra-regular">a young boy? One time I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was walking along the path, and I saw a young </span><span class="gemarra-regular">boy sitting at the crossroads. And I said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">On which path shall we walk </span>in order to get <span class="gemarra-regular">to the city? He said to me: This </span>path <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">short and long, and that </span>path <span class="gemarra-regular">is long and short. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I walked on the </span>path that was <span class="gemarra-regular">short and long. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">When I approached the city I found that gardens and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">orchards surrounded it, </span>and I did not know the trails leading through them to the city.  
<span class="gemarra-regular">I went back </span>and met the young boy again and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: My son, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t you tell me </span>that this way is <span class="gemarra-regular">short? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He said to me: And didn’t I tell you </span>that it is also <span class="gemarra-regular">long</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I kissed him on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his head and said to him: Happy are you, O </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Israel, for you are all exceedingly wise, from your old </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to your young. </span>
Having discussed wise speech and the wisdom of Jewish women, the Gemara cites the following story: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">walking along the way, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">met Berurya. He said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">her: On which path shall we walk </span>in order to get <span class="gemarra-regular">to Lod? She said to him: Foolish Galilean, didn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t the Sages say: Do not talk much with women? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">You should have said </span>your question more succinctly: <span class="gemarra-regular">Which </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">to Lod?</span>
The Gemara relates more of Berurya’s wisdom: <span class="gemarra-regular">Berurya came across a certain student </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who was whispering his studies </span>rather than raising his voice. 

Daf 54a

<span class="gemarra-regular">She</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> kicked him </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Isn’t it written</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as follows: “Ordered in all things and secure” </span>(ii Samuel 23:5), which indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">is ordered</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in your 248 limbs, </span>i.e., if you exert your entire body in studying it, <span class="gemarra-regular">it will be secure, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if not, it will not be secure. </span>The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">it was </span>similarly <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Eliezer had a student who would study quietly, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span><span class="gemarra-regular">three years he forgot his studies. </span>
Incidental to the story cited above involving a student of Rabbi Eliezer, the Gemara cites the following episode: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer had a student who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was liable for </span>the punishment of death by <span class="gemarra-regular">burning, </span>for his sins <span class="gemarra-regular">against God, </span>but the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Let him</span> alone and do not punish him as he deserves, because <span class="gemarra-regular">he served a great person.</span>
The Gemara cites instructions issued by Shmuel that are similar to those of Berurya. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: Keen scholar [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shinnana</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> open your mouth and read </span>from the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">open</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your mouth and study </span>the Talmud, <span class="gemarra-regular">in order that </span>your studies <span class="gemarra-regular">should endure in you and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">live a long life, as it is stated: “For they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are life to those who find them, and health to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all their flesh” </span>(Proverbs 4:22). <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not read: “To those</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who find them [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lemotzeihem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” but </span>rather <span class="gemarra-regular">“to those</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who express them [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lemotzi’eihem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” with </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">mouth.</span>
The Gemara cites additional instructions issued by Shmuel: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda, </span>his beloved student: <span class="gemarra-regular">Keen scholar, grab and eat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> grab and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> drink, as the world from which we are departing is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like a wedding feast, </span>whose joy is only temporary, and one who does not take pleasure in it now will not be able to do so in the future. 
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said to Rav Hamnuna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: My son, if you have </span>money, <span class="gemarra-regular">do well for yourself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>There is no point waiting, <span class="gemarra-regular">as there is no pleasure</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the netherworld, and death does not tarry. And if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you say: I will </span>save up in order to <span class="gemarra-regular">leave</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for my children, who told you the la</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the netherworld, </span>i.e., how do you know which of you will die first (<span class="it-text">Arukh</span>)? <span class="gemarra-regular">People are similar to grass </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the field, </span>in that <span class="gemarra-regular">these blossom, </span>i.e., grow, and their actions are blessed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and these wither </span>and die. 
Having expounded the verse “For they are life to those who find them” as referring to the Torah, the Gemara cites another teaching related to this verse that praises the Torah. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One who is walking along</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the way without a companion </span>and is afraid <span class="gemarra-regular">should engage</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in Torah </span>study, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated </span>with regard to the words of Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For they shall be a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">graceful wreath [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">livyat</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>for your head, and chains about your neck” (Proverbs 1:9). The word <span class="it-text">livyat</span> is understood here as a reference to <span class="it-text">levaya</span>, accompaniment, so that the verse is interpreted to mean that Torah is a graceful accompaniment to one who is traveling. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">One who feels </span>pain <span class="gemarra-regular">in his head should engage</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in Torah </span>study, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “For they shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be a graceful wreath for your head.” One who feels</span> pain <span class="gemarra-regular">in his throat should engage in Torah </span>study, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is stated: “And chains about your neck.” One who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> feels </span>pain <span class="gemarra-regular">in his intestines should engage in Torah </span>study, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “It shall be health to your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> navel” </span>(Proverbs 3:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">One who feels </span>pain <span class="gemarra-regular">in his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bones should engage in Torah </span>study, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “And marrow to your bones” </span>(Proverbs 3:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who feels </span>pain <span class="gemarra-regular">in his entire body should engage in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah </span>study, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And health to all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their flesh” </span>(Proverbs 4:22).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Come and see that the attribute of flesh and blood </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is unlike the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He. The attribute of flesh and blood </span>is that when <span class="gemarra-regular">a person gives a drug to his fellow, it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">good for this </span>part of his body <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">harmful to that </span>other part of his body. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the attribute of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One, Blessed be He, is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so; He gave the Torah to the Jewish people, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a drug of life for one’s entire </span><span class="gemarra-regular">body, as it is stated: “And health to all their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">flesh.”</span>
The Gemara continues with praise for Torah study and knowledge. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ami said: What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is written: “For it is a pleasant thing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if you keep them within you; let them be firmly </span><span class="gemarra-regular">attached together to your lips” </span>(Proverbs 22:18)? <span class="gemarra-regular">When are words</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Torah pleasant? When you keep them within you </span>and know them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when will you keep them within you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? When they will be attached together to your lips, </span>i.e., when you articulate them audibly and expound them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said </span>that this idea is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: “A man has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">joy in the answer of his mouth; and a word </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in due season, how good it is” </span>(Proverbs 15:23). <span class="gemarra-regular">When</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does a man have joy? When an answer </span>related to Torah study <span class="gemarra-regular">is in his mouth. Another version: When does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a man have joy in the answer of his mouth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? When </span>he experiences the fulfillment of: <span class="gemarra-regular">A word in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">due season, how good it is, </span>i.e., when he knows when and how to address each issue.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak said </span>that this idea is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “But the matter is very near to you, in your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mouth and in your heart, that you may do it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Deuteronomy 30:14). <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">very near to you? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">When it is in your mouth and in your heart, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that you may do it, </span>i.e., when you articulate your Torah study.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that this idea is actually derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here: “You have given him his heart’s desire, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and have not withheld the request of his lips, Selah” </span>(Psalms 21:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">When have You given him his heart’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> desire? When You have not withheld the request of his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lips, Selah, </span>i.e., when he converses in words of Torah.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised an </span>internal <span class="gemarra-regular">contradiction </span>in that very verse: In the beginning of the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written: “You have given him his heart’s desire,” </span>implying that it is enough for one to request in his heart, whereas in the end of the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written: “And You have not withheld the request of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his lips, Selah,” </span>indicating that one must express his prayers verbally. Rava himself resolved the contradiction: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">is fortunate, “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">You have given him his heart’s desire,” </span>even if he does not give verbal expression to his wants. But if he <span class="gemarra-regular">is not fortunate, </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">“You have not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> withheld the request of his lips, Selah.”</span>
With regard to the end of this verse, a Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wherever it states </span><span class="gemarra-italic">netzaḥ</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Selah, </span>or <span class="gemarra-italic">va</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’ed</span>, the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">will never cease. </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Netzaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is written: “For I will not contend </span><span class="gemarra-regular">forever; neither will I be eternally [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lanetzaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] angry” </span>(Isaiah 57:16), which demonstrates that <span class="it-text">netzaḥ</span> bears a similar meaning to forever. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Selah, as it is written: “As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we have heard, so have we seen in the city</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Lord of Hosts, in the city of our</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> God; may God establish it forever, Selah” </span>(Psalms 48:9), which demonstrates that Selah means forever. <span class="gemarra-italic">Va’ed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written: “The Lord shall reign forever and ever</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">va’ed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Exodus 15:18).
In light of the previous discussion, the Gemara cites several expositions of verses proposed by Rabbi Eliezer, while first providing them with a <span class="gemarra-regular">mnemonic: Chains, cheeks, tablets, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">engraved. Rabbi Eliezer said: What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “And chains about your neck” </span>(Proverbs 1:9)? <span class="gemarra-regular">If a person makes himself like a chain that hangs</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> loosely on the neck, </span>i.e., if a scholar is not pushy and disruptive to others, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he is also <span class="gemarra-regular">seen but not seen, </span>i.e., just as a chain is covered by clothes and hair, so too, the scholar does not let himself be seen, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">study</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will endure. But if not, </span>if he acts in a rude and arrogant manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">study will not endure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Eliezer </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is written: “His </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cheeks are like a bed of spices” </span>(Song of Songs 5:13)? <span class="gemarra-regular">If a person makes himself </span>humble <span class="gemarra-regular">like this </span>garden <span class="gemarra-regular">bed upon which everyone treads, and like this spice with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which everyone perfumes himself, </span>i.e., which benefits not only the one who wears it, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">study will endure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. But if not, his </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">study will not endure.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Eliezer </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">said: What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written: “Tablets [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">luḥot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of stone” </span>(Exodus 31:18)? <span class="gemarra-regular">If a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person makes his cheeks [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">leḥayav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] like this stone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that does not wear away, his </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">study will endure. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But if not, </span>i.e., if he is not diligent in his studies, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">study will not endure.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And, </span>lastly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>“And the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, <span class="gemarra-regular">engraved upon the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tablets” </span>(Exodus 32:16)? This teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">had the first tablets</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the subject of this verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">not been broken, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah would never have been forgotten from the Jewish people, </span>as the Torah would have been engraved upon their hearts.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ya’akov said: </span>Had the tablets not been broken, <span class="gemarra-regular">no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nation or tongue would </span>ever <span class="gemarra-regular">have ruled over them, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is stated: “Engraved</span>”; <span class="gemarra-regular">do not read </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">engraved</span> [<span class="gemarra-italic">ḥarut]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>rather <span class="gemarra-regular">freedom [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥeirut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">].</span>
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mattana said: What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is written: </span>“The well that the princes dug out, that the nobles of the people delved, with the scepter, with their staves. <span class="gemarra-regular">And from the wilderness they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> went to Mattanah” </span>(Numbers 21:18)? <span class="gemarra-regular">If a person makes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">himself </span>humble <span class="gemarra-regular">like this wilderness</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is open to all and <span class="gemarra-regular">upon which everyone treads, his </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">study will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">endure </span>and be given to him as a gift [<span class="it-text">mattana</span>]. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if not, his </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">study will not endure. </span>
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosef had a grievanc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> against Rava, son of Rav Yosef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Ḥama, </span>who is usually referred to in the Gemara simply as Rava, and as a result of the grievance the two would never meet. <span class="gemarra-regular">When the eve of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur arrived, </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I will go and appease </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him. He went and found </span>Rav Yosef’s <span class="gemarra-regular">attendant mixing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him a cup </span>of wine. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to </span>the attendant: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to me, and I will mix </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gave it to </span>Rava, and Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">mixed it. </span>Rav Yosef was blind and could not see his visitor, but <span class="gemarra-regular">when</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he tasted </span>the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: This mixture is similar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the mixture </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son of Rav Yosef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Ḥama, </span>who would add extra water to the wine. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: It is I.</span>
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Do not sit on your knees until you have explained</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these verses to me: What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which is written: “And from the wilderness to Mattanah; and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth; and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from Bamoth to the valley </span>in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks out toward the desert” (Numbers 21:19–20)? 
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If a person makes himself </span>humble <span class="gemarra-regular">like this wilderness, </span>which is open to all and <span class="gemarra-regular">upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which everyone treads, the Torah will be given to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him as a gift [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mattana</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. And once it is given</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him as a gift, he inherits it [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">neḥalo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">God [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">El</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>makes it His inheritance, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is stated: “And from Mattanah to Nahaliel.” And once God</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has made it His inheritance, he rises to greatness, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is stated: “And from Nahaliel to Bamoth,” </span>which means heights.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if he becomes haughty, the Holy </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One, Blessed be He, lowers him, as it is stated: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And from Bamoth to the valley.” And if he repents, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One, Blessed be He, raises him </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">up, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Every valley shall be exalted” </span>(Isaiah 40:4).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is written: “Your flock found a dwelling in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it; You, O God, prepare of Your goodness for the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">poor” </span>(Psalms 68:11)? <span class="gemarra-regular">If a person makes himself like an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> anima</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that tramples </span>its prey <span class="gemarra-regular">and eats </span>it immediately, without being particular about its food, i.e., if a scholar immediately reviews what he has heard from his teacher; <span class="gemarra-regular">and some say, </span>like an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">that soils and eats</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., if a scholar is not particular about maintaining his honor during his Torah study, just as an animal is not particular about the quality of its food, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">study will endure. And if not, his </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">study will not endure. And if he does so, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Holy One, Blessed be He, will Himself prepare him a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">feast, as it is stated: “You, O God, prepare of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Your goodness for the poor,” </span>indicating that God in His goodness will Himself prepare a feast for that pauper.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is written: “He who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> guards the fig tree shall eat its fruit” </span>(Proverbs 27:18)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Why were matters of Torah compared to a fig </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tree? Just as this fig tree, </span>

Daf 54b

<span class="gemarra-regular">whenever a person searches it </span>for figs to eat, <span class="gemarra-regular">he finds figs in it, </span>as the figs on a tree do not ripen all at once, so that one can always find a recently ripened fig, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>too, with <span class="gemarra-regular">matters of Torah. Whenever a person </span><span class="gemarra-regular">meditates upon them, he finds in them </span>new <span class="gemarra-regular">meaning.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is written: “A loving hind and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a graceful roe, </span>let her breasts satisfy you at all times, and be you ravished always with her love” (Proverbs 5:19)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Why were matters of Torah compared to a hind</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? To tell you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a hind, its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> womb is narrow and it is cherished by its mate</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> each and every hour like the first hour, so </span>too, <span class="gemarra-regular">matters of Torah are cherished by those who study them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> each and every hour like the first hour.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">“And a graceful roe” </span>is expounded as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">bestows grace upon those who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> study it. “Let her breasts satisfy you at all times</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”; why were matters of Torah compared to a breast? Just</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a breast, whenever a baby searches it </span>for milk to suckle, <span class="gemarra-regular">he finds milk in it, so </span>too, with <span class="gemarra-regular">matters of Torah. Whenever a person meditates upon them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he finds </span>new <span class="gemarra-regular">meaning in them. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">“And be you ravished always with her </span><span class="gemarra-regular">love”; </span>your love for Torah should always distract you from worldly matters, <span class="gemarra-regular">as was </span>the case with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Pedat. They said of him, of Rabbi Elazar, that he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would sit and engage in Torah </span>study <span class="gemarra-regular">in the lower</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> marketplace of Tzippori, and his cloak was lying in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upper marketplace of Tzippori. </span>His mind was so focused on Torah study that he would act in this unusual manner. In this regard, the Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Elazar said: One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> time a person came to take </span>this cloak for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">and found a serpent on it </span>guarding it. 
In further praise of the Torah and those who study it, a Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Rav Anan taught: What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is written: “You that ride on white </span><span class="gemarra-regular">donkeys, you that sit on rich cloths, and you that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">walk by the way, tell of it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> (Judges 5:10)? <span class="gemarra-regular">“You that ride on white donkeys”; these are Torah scholars</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who travel from city to city and from province to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> province to study Torah. “White [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzeḥorot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>are those <span class="gemarra-regular">who make it </span>clear <span class="gemarra-regular">as noon </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">tzahorayim</span>], i.e., who make the Torah comprehensible. <span class="gemarra-regular">“You that sit on couches [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">midin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>refers to those <span class="gemarra-regular">who judge [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">danin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] an absolutely </span><span class="gemarra-regular">true judgment. “And you that walk”; these are the masters </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Bible, </span>who are the least important of the scholars. <span class="gemarra-regular">“By the way”; these are the </span>more important <span class="gemarra-regular">masters of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Mishna. “Tell of it”; these are the masters of Talmud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the most important of all, <span class="gemarra-regular">as all their conversation is</span> about <span class="gemarra-regular">matters of Torah. </span>
The Gemara continues with this topic: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheizvi said in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Azarya: What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is written: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">The slothful man [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">remiyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] will not roast [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yaḥarokh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">catch” </span>(Proverbs 12:27)? <span class="gemarra-regular">The deceitful [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">rammai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] hunte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not live [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yiḥyeh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] a long life [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ya’arikh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>A deceitful hunter continues to hunt more and more animals without holding on to the animals he has already caught. Similarly, someone who continues to study new material without reviewing what he has already learned will not be successful.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: </span>Will <span class="gemarra-regular">a deceitful hunter </span>have something to <span class="gemarra-regular">roast</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> One who acts in this way is a fool, but it is hard to describe him as deceitful. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: This is comparable to a hunter who is hunting</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> birds; if he breaks </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">wings </span>of the birds <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by one </span>as he captures them so that they will be unable to fly off again, his prey <span class="gemarra-regular">will be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> secured, and if not, </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">will not be secured.</span> According to this explanation, the word <span class="it-text">rammai</span> is interpreted as cunning rather than deceitful. A cunning hunter secures his prey; similarly, a cunning student reviews each lesson and thereby retains that which he learns. 
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that Rav Seḥora said that Rav Huna said: What is</span> the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is written: “Wealth gotten through</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> vanity </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">hevel</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be diminished; but he that gathers</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> little by little shall increase” </span>(Proverbs 13:11)? <span class="gemarra-regular">If a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">person turns his Torah into bundles </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavilot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>derived from the word <span class="it-text">hevel</span> by replacing the <span class="it-text">heh</span> with a <span class="it-text">ḥet</span>], studying large amounts at the same time, his Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">diminish. And if not, </span>i.e., if he learns little by little and reviews what he has learned, <span class="gemarra-regular">he that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gathers little by little shall increase.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: The Sages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">know this, but </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">transgress it, </span>i.e., they fail to heed this advice. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did this, </span>learning little by little and regularly reviewing what I had learned, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>my learning <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">endured. </span>
The Gemara continues to discuss methods of Torah study. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What was the order of teaching </span>the Oral Law? How was the Oral Law first taught? <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses learned </span>directly <span class="gemarra-regular">from the mouth of the Almighty. Aaron entered </span>and sat before him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Moses taught him his lesson </span>as he had learned it from God. <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron moved </span>aside <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sat to the left of Moses. </span>Aaron’s <span class="gemarra-regular">sons entered</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and Moses taught them their lesson </span>while Aaron listened. Aaron’s <span class="gemarra-regular">sons moved </span>aside; <span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar sat to the right </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Moses and Itamar </span>sat <span class="gemarra-regular">to the left of Aaron.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehuda </span>disagreed with the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> with regard to the seating arrangements and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Actually, Aaron would return to</span> sit to <span class="gemarra-regular">the right of Moses. The elders entered and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Moses taught them their lesson. The elders moved </span>aside, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire nation entered and Moses taught them their lesson</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Therefore, Aaron had </span>heard the lesson <span class="gemarra-regular">four times, his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sons </span>heard it <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>times, <span class="gemarra-regular">the elders </span>heard it <span class="gemarra-regular">twice</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the entire nation </span>heard it <span class="gemarra-regular">once.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Moses </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">departed </span>to his tent, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Aaron taught </span>the others <span class="gemarra-regular">his lesson </span>as he had learned it from Moses. <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">departed </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sons taught </span>the others <span class="gemarra-regular">their lesson. His sons </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">departed</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">the elders taught </span>the rest of the people <span class="gemarra-regular">their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lesson. Hence everyone, </span>Aaron, his sons, the elders and all the people, heard the lesson taught by God <span class="gemarra-regular">four times</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">From </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here Rabbi Eliezer said: A person is obligated to teach </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his student </span>his lesson <span class="gemarra-regular">four times. And </span>it follows by way of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inference: If Aaron, who learned </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from Moses </span>himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Moses </span>had received the Torah directly <span class="gemarra-regular">from the mouth of the Almighty, </span>needed <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>regimen; <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ordinary </span>student learning <span class="gemarra-regular">from the mouth of an ordinary </span>teacher, <span class="gemarra-regular">how much more so </span>must he review his studies four times.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says: From where </span>do we derive <span class="gemarra-regular">that a person is obligated to teach his student</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until he learns </span>the material and understands it? <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is stated: </span>“Now therefore write this song for you, <span class="gemarra-regular">and teach it to the children of Israel; </span>put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 31:19). This verse indicates that one must teach Torah to others. <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>do we derive that one must teach his students <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the material <span class="gemarra-regular">is organized in their mouths? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: “Put it in their mouths,” </span>so that they should be capable of teaching it to others.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>do we derive <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a teacher <span class="gemarra-regular">must show </span>his students <span class="gemarra-regular">the reasons </span>for the teachings? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: “Now these are the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> judgments which you shall set before them” </span>(Exodus 21:1), which indicates that the lesson must be set out in logical fashion for the students.
With regard to the manner in which the Oral Law was taught, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">They should all have studied from Moses </span>himself four times. The Gemara answers: The teaching was divided in this manner <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to give honor to Aaron and his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sons, and </span>also to give <span class="gemarra-regular">honor to the elders. </span>
The Gemara asks why a different method was not adopted, one which would have involved less trouble for Moses: <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have entered and studied from Moses; his sons should </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">have entered and studied from Aaron; the elders should </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">have entered and studied from </span>Aaron’s <span class="gemarra-regular">sons; and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">they should have gone </span>out <span class="gemarra-regular">and taught all of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Jewish people. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since Moses had studied </span>directly <span class="gemarra-regular">from the mouth of the Almighty, it would be </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">effective </span>for everyone to hear the Torah at least once from Moses himself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: Actually, Aaron would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">return to </span>sit to <span class="gemarra-regular">the right of Moses, </span>i.e., no matter how many people were present Aaron always sat to Moses’ right. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">was it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> dealing with the rules of etiquette: If <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">were walking along the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">way</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the teacher </span>should walk <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the greater </span>of the two students should be <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">right and the lesser </span>one should be <span class="gemarra-regular">to his left</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and not </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages? </span>According to the Sages, the greater of the two students should be positioned to the left of the teacher so that the student’s right side faces his teacher. 
The Gemara answers: You can <span class="gemarra-regular">even say </span>that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> was taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sages, </span>and the reason they said that Aaron remained to Moses’ left even after the others entered is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the trouble to Aaron </span>if he would have to stand up and sit down again. 
Having discussed the importance of reviewing one’s Torah study, the Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Perida had a certain student whom </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he would </span>have to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach four hundred times, and </span>only then would he <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>the material, as he was incapable of understanding it otherwise. <span class="gemarra-regular">One day they requested </span>Rabbi Perida’s presence <span class="gemarra-regular">for a mitzva matte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> after the lesson. Rabbi Perida <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>his student four hundred times as usual, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>this time the student <span class="gemarra-regular">did not </span>successfully <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>the material. 
Rabbi Perida <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What is different </span><span class="gemarra-regular">now </span>that you are unable to grasp the lesson? <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: From the time that they said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Master </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a mitzva matter </span>for which he is needed, <span class="gemarra-regular">my mind was distracted </span>from the lesson <span class="gemarra-regular">and every moment I said: Now the Master will get</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> up, now the Master will get up </span>to go and perform the mitzva and he will not complete the lesson. Rabbi Perida <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Pay attention </span>this time <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I will teach you, </span>and know that I will not leave until you have fully mastered the lesson. <span class="gemarra-regular">He taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him again an additional four hundred times.</span>
Due to the merit of Rabbi Perida’s great devotion to his students, <span class="gemarra-regular">a Divine Voice emerged and said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: </span>Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">preferable to you that four hundred years</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be added </span>to your life, <span class="gemarra-regular">or that you and </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">your generation </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">merit the World-to-Come</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? He said: </span>I prefer <span class="gemarra-regular">that I and my generation merit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the World-to-Come. The Holy One, Blessed be He</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, said </span>to the angels: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give him both; </span>he shall live a very long life and he and the rest of his generation will merit the World-to-Come. 
The Gemara continues its discussion with regard to methods of Torah study: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: The Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> can be acquired only with </span>mnemonic <span class="gemarra-regular">signs </span>that aid the memory, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Put it in their mouths</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.” Do not read </span>the phrase as: <span class="gemarra-regular">Put it [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">simah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>rather as: <span class="gemarra-regular">Its sign [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">simanah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>thus indicating that mnemonic signs aid in memorizing the material. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Taḥalifa of the West, </span>i.e., from Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">heard this </span>statement and <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Rabbi Abbahu, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: You learn this </span>idea <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there; we learn it from here, </span>as the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Set up signposts [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tziyyunim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] for yourself; establish you </span>markers” (Jeremiah 31:20), which is understood to mean: <span class="gemarra-regular">Establish </span>mnemonic <span class="gemarra-regular">signs</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the Torah. And from where </span>may it be inferred <span class="gemarra-regular">that this </span>term <span class="gemarra-italic">tziyyun</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> denotes a sign? As it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written </span>in a different verse: “And when they that pass through shall pass through the land, <span class="gemarra-regular">and any sees a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> human bone, he shall set up a sign </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">tziyyun</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">by it” </span>(Ezekiel 39:15), i.e., a sign that there is a source of ritual impurity at that spot.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer said </span>that we learn this same idea <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: “Say to wisdom, you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are my sister, and call understanding, your kinswoman [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">moda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Proverbs 7:4), which means: <span class="gemarra-regular">Establish signs [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">moda’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>that convey knowledge of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah. Rava said </span>with regard to this verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">Set appointed times [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mo’adim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] for Torah </span>study. 

Daf 55a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>idea, that one must exert great effort to retain one’s Torah knowledge, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">what Avdimi bar Ḥama bar Dosa said: What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is written: “It is not in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> heaven…nor is it beyond the sea” </span>(Deuteronomy 30:12–13)? <span class="gemarra-regular">“It is not in heaven” </span>indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">that if it were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in heaven, you would have to ascend after it, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if it were beyond the sea, you would have to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cross after it, </span>as one must expend whatever effort is necessary in order to study Torah.
Expounding the verse differently, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">It is not in heaven” </span>means that Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to be found in someone who raises his mind over </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it, like the heavens, </span>i.e., he thinks his mind is above the Torah and he does not need a teacher; <span class="gemarra-regular">nor is it to be found in someone who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">expands his mind over it, like the sea, </span>i.e., he thinks he knows everything there is to know about the topic he has learned. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: “It is not in heaven</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>means that Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">is not to be found in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> haughty, </span>those who raise their self-image as though they were in heaven. <span class="gemarra-regular">“Nor is it beyond the sea” </span>means that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not to be found among merchants </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or traders </span>who are constantly traveling and do not have the time to study Torah properly. 
After the lengthy aggadic digression, the Gemara returns to the topic of the mishna, extending the outskirts of a city. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">How does one extend </span>the boundaries of <span class="gemarra-regular">cities? </span>If the city is <span class="gemarra-regular">long, </span>in the shape of a rectangle, the Shabbat limit is measured from the boundary <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is. </span>If the city is <span class="gemarra-regular">round, one creates </span>simulated <span class="gemarra-regular">corners for it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> rendering it square, and the Shabbat limit is measured from there. If it is <span class="gemarra-regular">square, one does not create </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">corners </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for it. </span>If the city <span class="gemarra-regular">was wide on one sid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and narrow on the other side, one regards it as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> though </span>the two sides <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">equal </span>length, adding to the narrow side to form a square. 
If <span class="gemarra-regular">one house </span>in a row of dwellings <span class="gemarra-regular">was protruding like a turret, or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">two houses </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">protruding like two turrets, one regards them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as though a cord is stretched over their </span>outer edge along the length of the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one measures two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thousand cubits </span>beginning <span class="gemarra-regular">from there. </span>If the city <span class="gemarra-regular">was shaped</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like a bo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or like </span>the Greek letter <span class="gemarra-italic">gamma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one regards it as though </span>the interior space were <span class="gemarra-regular">full of houses and courtyards, and one measures two thousand </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits </span>beginning <span class="gemarra-regular">from there.</span>
The Gemara proceeds to analyze the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said: </span>If the city is <span class="gemarra-regular">long, </span>the Shabbat limit is measured from the boundary <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is. </span>The Gemara expresses surprise: That is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary </span>to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the city is <span class="gemarra-regular">long and narrow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lest you say: Let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us give its breadth </span>the dimension <span class="gemarra-regular">of its length </span>and regard the city as if it were square, <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us </span>that we do not do so. 
The <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> stated: If the city is <span class="gemarra-regular">square, one does not create </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">corners for it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Once again the Gemara asks: That is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary </span>to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the shape of the city <span class="gemarra-regular">is square but </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">square is not </span>aligned with the <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>directions <span class="gemarra-regular">of the world</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., north, south, east, and west. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say: Let us </span>align the <span class="gemarra-regular">square with the four </span>directions of the <span class="gemarra-regular">world, it teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us </span>that this is not done. 
The <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> also stated: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one house </span>in a row of dwellings <span class="gemarra-regular">was protruding like a turret, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">two houses </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">protruding like two turrets, </span>one regards them as though a cord is stretched over their outer edge along the length of the city, and one measures two thousand cubits beginning from there. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, </span>if with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one house, you said </span>to extend the city’s boundaries, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two houses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, is it necessary </span>to say so? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary </span>to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to a case where the two houses were protruding <span class="gemarra-regular">on two </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">sides </span>of the city. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say: </span>When a house protrudes <span class="gemarra-regular">from one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">side, we say </span>that the city is extended even due to a single house, but if houses protrude <span class="gemarra-regular">from two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sides we do not say </span>so; therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches us </span>to regard the city as though it is extended on both sides. 
The <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> stated: If the city <span class="gemarra-regular">was shaped like a bow or like </span>the Greek letter <span class="gemarra-italic">gamma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one regards it as if </span>the interior space were <span class="gemarra-regular">full of houses and courtyards, and one measures</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two thousand cubits </span>beginning <span class="gemarra-regular">from there. Rav Huna said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a city that is shaped like a bow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the following distinction applies: <span class="gemarra-regular">If there are less than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four thousand cubits between </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">two ends </span>of the bow, so that the Shabbat limits measured from the two ends of the city overlap, the interior space of the bow is regarded as if it were filled with houses, and <span class="gemarra-regular">one measures </span>the Shabbat limit of the city <span class="gemarra-regular">from the</span> imaginary <span class="gemarra-regular">bowstring </span>stretched between the two ends of the bow. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the case, and the distance between the two ends of the bow is four thousand cubits or more, <span class="gemarra-regular">one measures </span>the Shabbat limit <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the bow </span>itself.  
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did Rav Huna </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the distance between two sections of a single city that renders them separate entities is four thousand cubits? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rav Huna say: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the wall of a city that was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">breached</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> even if there is a gap between two sections of the city, the city is still considered a single entity if the breach is no more than <span class="gemarra-regular">141</span><span class="gemarra-regular">⅓</span> cubits? However, if the breach is wider, the two sections are considered separate entities. Apparently, a distance of 141⅓ cubits suffices to separate between two sections of a city and to render them separate entities. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Ulla said: </span>That is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>where Rav Huna speaks of four thousand cubits, he is referring to a case where the gap is <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> side, </span>as the other side, the bow, is inhabited; but <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>where he speaks of 141⅓ cubits, he is referring to a case where the breach is <span class="gemarra-regular">from two sides</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which truly renders the city two separate entities.
The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us </span>in the case of the breached city wall, that <span class="gemarra-regular">one allocates a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>an area measuring slightly more than seventy cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">to this </span>section of the city <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to that </span>section of the city? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t Rav Huna </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">on one occasion? As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a mishna: 

Daf 55b

<span class="gemarra-regular">One allocates a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>every <span class="gemarra-regular">city, </span>i.e., an area of slightly more than seventy cubits is added to the boundary of a city and the Shabbat limit is measured from there; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Meir. And the Sages say: They spoke of </span>the measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only </span>with regard to the space <span class="gemarra-regular">between two </span>adjacent <span class="gemarra-regular">cities, </span>i.e., if adjacent cities are separated by a shorter distance than that, they are considered one city.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disputed this issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: A </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span> is added <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>another <span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span> is added <span class="gemarra-regular">to that </span>city, so that as long as the cities are not separated by a distance of slightly more than 141 cubits, they are considered one entity. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Ḥiyya bar Rav said: One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">allocates only one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the two of them. </span>Accordingly, Rav Huna has already stated that the measure of a <span class="it-text">karpef</span> is added to both cities in determining whether they are close enough to be considered a single entity. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>for Rav Huna to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in both instances, <span class="gemarra-regular">as, had he taught it to us </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of the breached wall, one might have said that a <span class="it-text">karpef</span> is allocated to each city only in that case <span class="gemarra-regular">because it had an aspect of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permissibility from the outset, </span>namely, the two sections originally formed one city. <span class="gemarra-regular">But there, </span>with regard to the two cities, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not the case </span>and the two cities are only considered as one if they are separated by less than the measure of a single <span class="it-text">karpef</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And had he taught </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">us </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>with regard to the two cities, one might have said that only in that case is a <span class="it-text">karpef</span> allocated to each city <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>one <span class="it-text">karpef</span> would be too <span class="gemarra-regular">cramped for the use </span>of both cities. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>in the case of the breached wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="it-text">karpef</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">would not be </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">cramped for the use </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>both sections, as the vacant space is inside the city, in an area that had not been used in this fashion before the wall was breached, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the case and a single <span class="it-text">karpef</span> is sufficient. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was necessary </span>to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in both cases. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span>distance may there be <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the imaginary <span class="gemarra-regular">bowstring and </span>the center of the <span class="gemarra-regular">bo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> in a city that is shaped like a bow? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna said: Two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thousand cubits. Rava, son of Rabba bar Rav Huna, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Even more than two thousand cubits. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: It stands to reason in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, son of Rabba bar Rav Huna, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if one wants, he can return and go </span>anywhere within the bow <span class="gemarra-regular">by way of the houses. </span>Since one can always walk to the end of the city, and from there he is permitted to walk down the line of the imaginary bowstring, he should also be permitted to walk from the middle of the bow to the bowstring, even if the distance is more than two thousand cubits. 
We learned in the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">there were remnants </span>of walls <span class="gemarra-regular">ten</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handbreadths high </span>on the outskirts of a city, they are considered part of the city, and the Shabbat limit is measured from them. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">remnants? Rav Yehuda said: Three partitions that do not have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a roof over them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which are considered part of the city despite the fact that they do not comprise a proper house.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two partitions </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">have a roof over them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is this structure also treated like a house? <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">These </span>are the structures <span class="gemarra-regular">that are included in </span>the city’s <span class="gemarra-regular">extension: A monument [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nefesh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>over a grave <span class="gemarra-regular">that is four cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by four cubits; and a bridge or a grave in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which there is a residence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a synagogue in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which there is a residence for the sexton </span>or synagogue attendant, and which is used not only for prayer services at specific times; <span class="gemarra-regular">and an idolatrous temple in which there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a residence for the priests; and </span>similarly, horse <span class="gemarra-regular">stables</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and storehouses in the fields in which there is a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> residence; and </span>small <span class="gemarra-regular">watchtowers in </span>the fields; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> house on </span>an island in <span class="gemarra-regular">the sea </span>or lake, which is located within seventy cubits of the city; all of <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>structures <span class="gemarra-regular">are included in the </span>city’s boundaries. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And these </span>structures <span class="gemarra-regular">are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not included in </span>the boundaries of a city: <span class="gemarra-regular">A tomb</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was breached on both sides, </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., from one side all the way to the other; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">a bridge and a grave that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do not have a residence; and a synagogue that does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not have a residence for the sexton; and an idolatrous </span><span class="gemarra-regular">temple that does not have a residence for the priests; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">stables and storehouses in fields that do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have a residence, </span>and therefore are not used for human habitation; <span class="gemarra-regular">and a cistern, and an </span>elongated water <span class="gemarra-regular">ditch</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and a cave, </span>i.e., a covered cistern, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a wall, and a dovecote in </span>the field; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">a house on a boat </span>that is not permanently located within seventy cubits of the city; all of <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>structures <span class="gemarra-regular">are not included in the </span>city’s boundaries.
<span class="gemarra-regular">In any case, it was taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a tomb</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was breached on both sides, </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>is not included in the city’s boundaries. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span>is this <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>referring to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a roof </span>on the tomb, and the two remaining walls are not included in the city’s boundaries even though they have a roof? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is no roof </span>on the tomb. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">A house on </span>an island in <span class="gemarra-regular">the sea, what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">suitable for </span>if it is not actually part of the inhabited area? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a house used to move a ship’s utensils </span>into it for storage. 
The Gemara raises another question with regard to the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is a cave </span>on the outskirts of a city really <span class="gemarra-regular">not included in its extension? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A cave </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is included in its extension? Abaye said: </span>That statement applies <span class="gemarra-regular">when there is a structure </span>built <span class="gemarra-regular">at its entrance, </span>which is treated like a house on the outskirts of the city. 
The Gemara asks: If there is a structure at the entrance to the cave, why is the cave mentioned? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that it is treated like a house <span class="gemarra-regular">because of the structure itself. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, it is necessary </span>only in a case where the cave serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to complete </span>the structure, i.e., where the area of the structure and cave combined are only four by four cubits, which is the minimum size of a house.
The discussion with regard to measuring Shabbat limits has been referring to a properly built city. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: Those who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dwell in huts, </span>i.e., in thatched hovels of straw and willow branches, are not considered inhabitants of a city. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">one measures </span>the Shabbat limit <span class="gemarra-regular">for them only from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the entrance to their homes; </span>the huts are not combined together and considered a city. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda raised an objection</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The Torah states with regard to the Jewish people in the desert: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they pitched by the Jordan, from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Beit-HaYeshimot </span>to Avel-Shittim in the plains of Moab” (Numbers 33:49), <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabba bar bar Ḥana said that Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan said: I myself saw that place, and it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">three parasangs [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">parsa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>the equivalent of twelve <span class="it-text">mil</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">by three</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> parasangs.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">When they would defecate </span>in the wilderness, <span class="gemarra-regular">they would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not defecate in front of themselves, </span>i.e., in front of the camp, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not to their sides, </span>due to respect for the Divine Presence; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>they would do so <span class="gemarra-regular">behind </span>the camp. This indicates that even on Shabbat, when people needed to defecate, they would walk the entire length of the camp, which was considerably longer than two thousand cubits, which equals one <span class="it-text">mil</span>. It is apparent that the encampment of the Jewish people was considered to be a city despite the fact that it was composed of tents alone. How, then, did Rav Huna say that those who live in huts are not considered city dwellers?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: The banners of the desert, you say? </span>Are you citing a proof from the practice of the Jewish people as they traveled through the desert according to their tribal banners? <span class="gemarra-regular">Since it is written with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them: “According to the commandment of the Lord they remained </span><span class="gemarra-regular">encamped, and according to the commandment of the Lord they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">journeyed” </span>(Numbers 9:20), <span class="gemarra-regular">it was considered as though it were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a permanent </span>residence <span class="gemarra-regular">for them. </span>A camp that is established in accordance with the word of God is regarded as a permanent settlement. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥinnana bar Rav Kahana said that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ashi said: If there are three courtyards of two</span> properly built <span class="gemarra-regular">houses </span>among a settlement of huts, <span class="gemarra-regular">they have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> been established </span>as a permanent settlement, and the Shabbat limit is measured from the edge of the settlement. 
On the topic of people who dwell in huts, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that Rav said: Those who dwell in huts, </span>such as shepherds who pass from one place to another and stay in a single location for only a brief period, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> desert travelers, their lives are not lives, </span>i.e., they lead extremely difficult lives, <span class="gemarra-regular">and their wives and children </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are not </span>always <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>own, as will be explained below. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">That</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was also taught </span>in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Eliezer of Biriyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: Those who dwell in huts are like those who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dwell in graves. And with regard to </span>one who marries <span class="gemarra-regular">their daughters</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">says: “Cursed be he who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sleeps with any manner of beast” </span>(Deuteronomy 27:21).
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>for this harsh statement with regard to the daughters of those who dwell in huts or travel in deserts? <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said: They do not have bathhouses, </span>and therefore the men have to walk a significant distance in order to bathe. There is concern that while they are away their wives commit adultery, and that consequently their children are not really their own. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Because they sense </span><span class="gemarra-regular">when one another immerses. </span>Similarly to the men, the women must walk a significant distance in order to immerse in a ritual bath. Since the settlement is very small and everyone knows when the women go to immerse, it is possible for an unscrupulous man to use this information to engage in adulterous relations with them by following them and taking advantage of the fact that they are alone. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span>practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the explanations of Ulla and Rabbi Yoḥanan? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them</span> in a case where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a river that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> adjacent to the house, </span>and it is suitable for immersion but not for bathing. Consequently, the women would not have to go far to immerse themselves, but the men would still have to walk a significant distance in order to bathe. 
Having mentioned various places of residence, the Gemara cites what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Any city that does not have vegetables, a Torah scholar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not permitted to dwell there </span>for health reasons. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say that vegetables are beneficial</span> to a person’s health? <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Three </span>things <span class="gemarra-regular">increase one’s waste, bend</span> his <span class="gemarra-regular">stature, and remove one five-hundredth of the light</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a person’s eyes; and they are </span>

Daf 56a

<span class="gemarra-regular">coarse bread, </span>made from coarse flour that has not been thoroughly sifted, <span class="gemarra-regular">new beer, and vegetables. </span>This indicates that vegetables are harmful to one’s well-being. The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>statement of Rav Huna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to garlic and leeks, </span>which are beneficial; <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to other vegetables, </span>which are harmful. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Garlic </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a healthy <span class="gemarra-regular">vegetable; leeks </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">a half-vegetable, </span>meaning they are half as healthful. If <span class="gemarra-regular">radish has been seen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, an elixir of life has been seen, </span>as it is very beneficial to the body. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">radish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has been seen, a lethal drug has been seen? </span>The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that deprecates radish, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">leaves; there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that praises radish, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the roots. </span>Alternatively, <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the summer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>when radish is beneficial; <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> winter, </span>when it is harmful.
On the topic of the attributes of different locations, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said that Rav said: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">any city that has </span>many <span class="gemarra-regular">ascents and descents, </span>which can be taxing to the body, <span class="gemarra-regular">people and animals die </span><span class="gemarra-regular">at half their days, </span>meaning half of their life expectancy. The Gemara expresses surprise: <span class="gemarra-regular">Can it enter your mind </span>that Rav really meant to say that they <span class="gemarra-regular">die </span>prematurely? Even in such cities they are known to have a regular life expectancy. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say: They grow old at half their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">days, </span>i.e., they age prematurely due to the strain of climbing up and down the inclines. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son of Rav Yehoshua, said: The ascents </span>and descents <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Biri and Beit Neresh, </span>my place of residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">made </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me grow old </span>prematurely. 
With regard to the measurements of a city’s boundaries, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If, in order to measure the Shabbat limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">one comes to square </span>a city, i.e., to extend the city’s boundaries to include all of its protrusions within an imaginary square, <span class="gemarra-regular">he squares it</span> so that the sides of the square align <span class="gemarra-regular">with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four </span>directions <span class="gemarra-regular">of the world</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He sets the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> northern </span>side of the square <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>align with <span class="gemarra-regular">the north</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the world, and its southern </span>side <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>align with <span class="gemarra-regular">the south of the world. And your sign </span>by which you can recognize the directions of the world is as follows: The constellation of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ursa Major is in the north</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Scorpi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in the south. </span>The directions of the city are determined by these constellations.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: If one does not know how to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">square </span>the city in alignment <span class="gemarra-regular">with the four </span>directions <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the world </span>based upon the constellations, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should square it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> based upon the seasons, </span>although this is less precise. <span class="gemarra-regular">How</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so? </span>Where <span class="gemarra-regular">the sun rises and sets on the longest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day </span>of the year, the summer solstice, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>route of the sun <span class="gemarra-regular">is the face of the north. </span>The sun rises in the northeast and sets in the northwest, and thus travels from east to west across the north side of the world. Conversely, where <span class="gemarra-regular">the sun rises and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sets on the shortest day </span>of the year, the winter solstice, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>route of the sun <span class="gemarra-regular">is the face of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the south. </span>Whereas at <span class="gemarra-regular">the vernal equinox and the autumnal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">equinox, </span>when day and night are equal in length, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sun rises in the middle of the east and sets </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle of the west</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: </span>“One generation passes away and another generation comes; but the earth abides forever. The sun also rises and the sun goes down, and hastens to its place, where it rises again. <span class="gemarra-regular">It goes toward the south, and turns about to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the north; </span>round and round goes the wind, and on its circuits the wind returns” (Ecclesiastes 1:4–6). The verse is understood as describing the sun’s movements, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">It goes toward the south</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> during the day; “and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> turns about to the north,” </span>on the other side of the earth, <span class="gemarra-regular">at night. “Round and round goes the wind</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ruaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">];” </span>the word <span class="it-text">ruaḥ</span> can also mean direction or side. Rabbi Yosei explains that <span class="gemarra-regular">these are the face of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the east and the face of the west; sometimes </span>the sun <span class="gemarra-regular">traverses them </span>visibly, <span class="gemarra-regular">and sometimes it turns about them</span> without being seen.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mesharshiya said: There</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is no </span>validity to these <span class="gemarra-regular">rules </span>established by Rabbi Yosei, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The sun</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has never risen, </span>even during the summer, <span class="gemarra-regular">at the northeastern</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> corner </span>of the sky <span class="gemarra-regular">and set in the northwestern corner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, nor has the sun </span>ever <span class="gemarra-regular">risen, </span>even during the winter, <span class="gemarra-regular">at the southeastern corner and set in the southwestern corner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Therefore, one can establish the directions of the world according to the sun’s path only during the autumn and spring. 
On the topic of the previous discussion with regard to calculating the directions of the world based upon the seasons, <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: The vernal equinox occurs only at </span>the beginning of one of <span class="gemarra-regular">the four quarters of a day: Either </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">at the beginning of the day, or </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">at the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> beginning of the night, or at midday, or at midnight</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">the summer solstice occurs only </span>at certain times of the day: <span class="gemarra-regular">Either at </span>the conclusion of <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a half </span>hours <span class="gemarra-regular">or seven and a half </span>hours <span class="gemarra-regular">of the day or night. And the autumnal equinox occurs</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only </span>at certain times: <span class="gemarra-regular">Either at </span>the conclusion of <span class="gemarra-regular">three</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hours or nine hours of the day or night. And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the winter solstice occurs only </span>at certain times: <span class="gemarra-regular">Either at</span> the conclusion of <span class="gemarra-regular">four and a half </span>hours <span class="gemarra-regular">or ten</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a half </span>hours <span class="gemarra-regular">of the day or night.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>all this is based on the principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">there are only ninety-one days and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seven and a half hours between </span>the beginning of <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> season and the next, </span>as he assumed that a year is exactly 365¼ days. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, each <span class="gemarra-regular">season </span>begins precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">one-half </span>planetary <span class="gemarra-regular">hour past the </span>beginning of the <span class="gemarra-regular">previous season. </span>There are seven heavenly bodies that are each ascendant for an hour at a time in a constant rotation: Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, and Venus. Each season begins half an hour later in this rotation than <span class="gemarra-regular">the previous </span>season. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: There is no </span>instance when the <span class="gemarra-regular">vernal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> equinox occurs in </span>the planetary hour of <span class="gemarra-regular">Jupiter </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not break the trees </span>with its strong winds; <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there is no </span>instance when <span class="gemarra-regular">the winter solstice occurs in</span> the planetary hour of <span class="gemarra-regular">Jupiter </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">it does not dry</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> up the seeds. And this </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">where the new</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> moon appeared either at </span>the hour of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Moon or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at </span>the hour of <span class="gemarra-regular">Jupiter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 

Daf 56b

<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught: One who squares a city </span>in order to determine its Shabbat limit <span class="gemarra-regular">renders it like a square tablet, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">then </span>he also <span class="gemarra-regular">squares the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries and renders them </span><span class="gemarra-regular">like a square tablet. </span>Consequently, after squaring the city, he adds additional squares of two thousand cubits to each of its sides.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And when he measures </span>the Shabbat limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should not measure </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits </span>diagonally <span class="gemarra-regular">from the middle of </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">corner </span>of the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>if he were to do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would lose </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the corners</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the limit would extend only two thousand cubits on the diagonal from each of the corners. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>he measures the boundary as though <span class="gemarra-regular">he brought </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a square tablet that is two thousand cubits by two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thousand cubits, and places it at </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">corner at its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">diagonal.</span>
As a result, <span class="gemarra-regular">it will be found </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the city gains four hundred cubits in this </span>corner <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">four hundred cubits in the </span>opposite corner. Assuming that the city itself is round and has a diameter of two thousand cubits, as will be explained below, when the borders of the city are squared, approximately four hundred cubits are added to the city at each corner. When one then squares the Shabbat boundaries, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is found </span>that the Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries gain eight hundred cubits in this </span>corner <span class="gemarra-regular">and eight hundred cubits in the </span>opposite corner. Consequently, by squaring both the city itself and its Shabbat boundaries, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is found </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the city and the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">gain 1,200 </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>corner <span class="gemarra-regular">and 1,200 </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span>opposite corner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: And you find </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>projection of the additions to the city’s borders and Shabbat boundaries to be correct <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of a round <span class="gemarra-regular">city that is two thousand </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">by two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thousand </span>cubits. 
The Gemara cites a similar discussion with regard to the Levite cities, the forty-eight cities given to the Levites in Eretz Yisrael instead of a tribal inheritance. <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, said: The boundary of the cities of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Levites </span>extends <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits </span>in each direction beyond the inhabited section of the city. <span class="gemarra-regular">Remove from them a thousand </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits of open space </span>just beyond the inhabited area, which must be left vacant. <span class="gemarra-regular">Consequently, the open space is one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> quarter </span>of the extended area, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the rest is fields</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and vineyards</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are these matters? </span>From where is it derived that the open space surrounding the cities of the Levites measured a thousand cubits? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: As the verse states: </span>“And the open spaces of the cities, that you shall give to the Levites, <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be from the wall of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">city and outward a thousand cubits round about” </span>(Numbers 35:4). <span class="gemarra-regular">The Torah states: Surround the city with a thousand </span>cubits on all sides to serve as an open space. <span class="gemarra-regular">Consequently</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the open space is one quarter </span>of the area.
The Gemara asks: Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">one quarter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> It is one half</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> One thousand cubits is exactly half of the two thousand cubits incorporated into the boundary of the cities of the Levites. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Bar Adda the surveyor explained </span>the calculation <span class="gemarra-regular">to me: You will find </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">in a city that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is two thousand </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">by two thousand </span>cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">How many</span> cubits is the extended <span class="gemarra-regular">boundary </span>of the city itself, without the corners? <span class="gemarra-regular">Sixteen </span>million square cubits. Squares measuring two thousand by two thousand cubits are appended to each of the four sides of the city. The area of each of these squares is four million square cubits, and the total area of all the additional squares is sixteen million square cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">How many </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">are the corners? Sixteen </span>million square cubits, as additional squares of two thousand by two thousand cubits are appended to the corners of the outer boundaries of the cities. <span class="gemarra-regular">Subtract eight </span>million square cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">from the</span> area of the extended <span class="gemarra-regular">boundary </span>for the open space around the city; the first thousand cubits beyond the inhabited part of the city must be left as open space, which amounts to areas measuring one thousand by two thousand cubits on each of the four sides of the city, for a total of eight million square cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>subtract another <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>million square cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">from the corners, </span>as sections of the corners are parallel to the open spaces. <span class="gemarra-regular">How much</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the sum total of the area of the open spaces? <span class="gemarra-regular">Twelve </span>million square cubits. 
The Gemara asks: According to this calculation, how is <span class="gemarra-regular">the open </span><span class="gemarra-regular">space found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">one quarter </span>of the area? <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is more than one-third. </span>The entire area of the extended boundary is thirty-two million square cubits and the open space occupies twelve million square cubits, which is more than one-third of the total area of the extended boundary.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Bring the four </span>million square cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">of the city </span>itself and <span class="gemarra-regular">add them </span>to the area of the limit, and you will arrive at the correct ratio. The Gemara asks: The opens space <span class="gemarra-regular">is still </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one-third, </span>as the total area of the city and its extended boundary is thirty-six million square cubits, and the area of the open space is twelve million square cubits. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you think </span>that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to a square </span>city? <span class="gemarra-regular">It was </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to a round </span>city. The open space beyond the city is also round; however, the total extended boundary is squared, so that the total area of a round city with a diameter of two thousand cubits and its extended boundary is thirty-six million square cubits. 
The Gemara explains the calculation: <span class="gemarra-regular">How much larger is </span>the area of <span class="gemarra-regular">a square </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than </span>the area of <span class="gemarra-regular">the circle? One quarter. Subtract one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">quarter from </span>the twelve million square cubits of open space, and <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span>million square cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">are left; and nine is</span> precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">one quarter of thirty-six.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: You will also find </span>that the open space is one quarter of the total area <span class="gemarra-regular">in a city that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a thousand </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">by a thousand </span>cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">How</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> many </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">is the </span>extended <span class="gemarra-regular">boundary </span>of the city without the corners?  It is <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>million square cubits. Additional areas are appended along each side of the city and extending two thousand cubits beyond the city itself. Each of these areas is two thousand cubits by one thousand cubits, for a total area of two million square cubits. Since there are four of these zones, their total area is eight million square cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">How many </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">are the corners? </span>They are <span class="gemarra-regular">sixteen </span>million square cubits, as squares of two thousand cubits by two thousand cubits are added to each of the four corners. 

Daf 57a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Subtract four </span>million square cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span>extended <span class="gemarra-regular">boundary </span>for the area of the open space, which is a thousand cubits by a thousand cubits on each side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>million square cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">from the corners, </span>a thousand cubits by a thousand cubits in each corner, which are connected to the open space. <span class="gemarra-regular">How much is </span>the sum total? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">eight</span> million square cubits. 
The Gemara asks: According to this calculation, the eight million square cubits of open space <span class="gemarra-regular">are one-third </span>of the total area of the extended boundary, which is twenty-four million square cubits. The Gemara answers as it answered above: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you think </span>that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a square </span>city? <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a round </span>city. <span class="gemarra-regular">How much larger is </span>the area of <span class="gemarra-regular">a square than </span>the area of <span class="gemarra-regular">a circle? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">one quarter </span>of the area of the circle. <span class="gemarra-regular">Subtract</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one quarter from </span>the eight million square cubits of open space, and <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>million square cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">are left; and six</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">one quarter of twenty-four.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of the statement that the open space is <span class="gemarra-regular">one quarter? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">one quarter </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">boundary. </span>This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> was indeed stated with regard to a square city. However, there is open space only along the sides of the city but not at its corners. Accordingly, a city that is two thousand cubits by two thousand cubits has a total extended boundary of thirty-two million square cubits, of which eight million square cubits, two thousand cubits by one thousand cubits on each side, is open space. The open space is thus one quarter of the total.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said </span>the opposite: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span> the meaning of the statement that the open space is <span class="gemarra-regular">one quarter </span>of the total extended boundary? <span class="gemarra-regular">One quarter of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the corners. </span>Open space is granted only in the corners, and not along the sides. Accordingly, the open space is one thousand cubits by a thousand cubits in each corner, for a total of four million square cubits. The total extended boundary in each corner is two thousand cubits by two thousand cubits, or four million square cubits per corner, which equals a grand total of sixteen million square cubits. Consequently, the open space is one quarter of the total extended boundary.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ashi: Isn’t it written </span>in the verse: “And the open spaces of the cities, that you shall give to the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward one thousand cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">around” </span>(Numbers 35:4)? The verse indicates that the city is provided with open space on all sides and not merely at its corners 
Rav Ashi responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">around? Around </span><span class="gemarra-regular">at the corners, </span>i.e., an open space of this size is provided at each corner. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if you do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not say so, </span>that the area of the corners is also called around, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offering, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And they shall sprinkle the blood around </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upon the altar” </span>(Leviticus 1:5), <span class="gemarra-regular">here, too, </span>will you say that the blood must be sprinkled <span class="gemarra-regular">literally “around” </span>the altar on all sides? The blood is sprinkled only upon the corners of the altar. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">around? Around the corners, </span>i.e., the mitzva is to sprinkle the blood at the corners, and this is considered sprinkling blood “around upon the altar.” <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>with regard to the open space of the cities of the Levites, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">around? Around the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> corners.</span>
The Gemara returns to its previous statement that the open space around a city of the Levites is one quarter of the total extended boundary when the city is round. It questions this statement based upon the mishna’s ruling that the boundaries of a city are always delineated as a square. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥavivi from Meḥoza said to Rav Ashi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: But aren’t there the protrusions of the corners</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> How can there be a thousand cubits of open space on each side; when the city is squared, the corners of the square protrude into the open space, thus reducing its area?
Rav Ashi replied: We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with a circular city. </span>Rav Ḥavivi responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">But haven’t they squared </span>the city? Rav Ashi responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say that we say </span>the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">We view </span>the city <span class="gemarra-regular">as if it were squared. Do we actually </span>add houses and <span class="gemarra-regular">square it? </span>Although for the purpose of calculating the extended boundary we view the city as a square, in actuality the uninhabited sections are part of the open space. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥanilai from Meḥoza said to Rav Ashi: Now</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, how much larger is </span>the area of <span class="gemarra-regular">a square than</span> the area of <span class="gemarra-regular">a circle? One quarter. </span>Therefore, if we calculate how much area a circular city with a diameter of two thousand cubits gains when it is squared, does it add up to <span class="gemarra-regular">these eight hundred </span>cubits mentioned above? The extra area added <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">667 minus one-third</span> cubits. 
Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">applies only to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a circle </span>enclosed <span class="gemarra-regular">within a square, </span>as the area of a circle is three-quarters the area of the square around it. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, with regard to the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">diagonal [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">alakhsona</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> space added in the corners of the square, <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is required. As the Master said: Every cubit </span>in the side <span class="gemarra-regular">of a square is one and two-fifths cubits </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in its diagonal. </span>Based on this rule, the calculation is exact.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One allocates a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>every <span class="gemarra-regular">city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the measure of a <span class="it-text">karpef</span>, which is slightly more than seventy cubits, is added to every city, and the two thousand cubits of the Shabbat limit are measured from there; <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: They spoke </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the addition of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only </span>with regard to the space <span class="gemarra-regular">between two </span>adjacent <span class="gemarra-regular">cities. </span>How so? <span class="gemarra-regular">If this </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">has seventy cubits and a remainder </span>vacant on one side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">has seventy cubits and a remainder </span>vacant on the adjacent side, and the two areas of seventy-plus cubits overlap, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> combines the two </span>cities <span class="gemarra-regular">into one.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">three</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> villages that are </span>arranged as <span class="gemarra-regular">a triangle, if there are</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">141⅓ </span>cubits separating <span class="gemarra-regular">between the two outer </span>villages, the <span class="gemarra-regular">middle </span>village <span class="gemarra-regular">combines the three </span>villages <span class="gemarra-regular">into one.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where are these matters, </span>that a <span class="it-text">karpef</span> is added to a city, derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: As the verse states: </span>“And the open spaces of the cities, that you shall give to the Levites, shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">from the wall of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> city and outward </span>a thousand cubits around. And you shall measure from outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits” (Numbers 35:4–5). <span class="gemarra-regular">The Torah says: Provide </span>a certain vacant space <span class="gemarra-regular">outsid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward </span><span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>the two thousand cubits.
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: They spoke </span>of the addition of a <span class="it-text">karpef</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only</span> with regard to the space between two adjacent cities. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed with regard to this issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: One allocates a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to this </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to that </span>city, so that the two cities together are granted a total of slightly more than 141 cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥiyya bar Rav said:</span> One allocates only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>common <span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the two of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them.</span>
The Gemara raises possible proofs for each opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis say: They spoke </span>of the addition of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only with regard to </span>the space <span class="gemarra-regular">between two </span>adjacent <span class="gemarra-regular">cities</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, </span>as it states that one <span class="it-text">karpef</span> is allocated rather than two.
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>in response to this difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>meant here by <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef </span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">the principle of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. In actuality, </span>one allocates <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to this </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>city. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">So, too, it is reasonable </span>to explain the mishna in the following manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it teaches </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause: If this </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">has seventy cubits and a remainder </span>vacant on one side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">has seventy cubits and a remainder </span>vacant on the adjacent side, and the two areas of seventy-plus cubits overlap, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> combines the two </span>cities <span class="gemarra-regular">into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one. </span>This indicates that an area of seventy cubits and a remainder is added to each city. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from this </span>that this is the correct understanding of the mishna.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is a conclusive refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥiyya bar Rav, </span>that two adjacent cities are granted only one <span class="it-text">karpef</span>. The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥiyya bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: </span>

Daf 57b

In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>clause of the mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>who maintains that one allocates a <span class="it-text">karpef</span> to each city. 
The Gemara continues to ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">If it is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, didn’t we </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learn in the first </span><span class="gemarra-regular">clause: One allocates a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karpef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">city; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir? </span>What need is there to mention Rabbi Meir’s opinion again? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary </span>to mention his opinion again, <span class="gemarra-regular">as, if </span>we had learned his opinion only <span class="gemarra-regular">from that </span>first clause, <span class="gemarra-regular">I might have said </span>that one allocates <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="it-text">karpef</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for one </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="it-text">karpef</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for two </span>cities. Therefore, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for two </span>cities, <span class="gemarra-regular">one allocates two </span><span class="it-text">karpef</span> areas. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the mishna had <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>this law only <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to two cities, one might have said that only in that case is each city granted a separate <span class="it-text">karpef</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>a smaller space between the two adjacent cities would be too <span class="gemarra-regular">crowded for the use </span>of both cities. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>with regard to one city, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the area of the city itself <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">crowded for the use</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>its residents, one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> given any <span class="it-text">karpef</span> whatsoever. Therefore, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the mishna to teach both clauses. 
The Gemara tries again to adduce proof from the mishna, in which <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned: And likewise, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">three villages that are aligned </span>in a row, <span class="gemarra-regular">if there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">141⅓ </span>cubits separating <span class="gemarra-regular">between the two outer ones, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">middle </span>village <span class="gemarra-regular">combines the three </span>villages <span class="gemarra-regular">into one. </span>At this point the Gemara understands that the mishna here is dealing with three villages arranged in a straight line. Therefore, it makes the following inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>that the three villages are considered as one <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>only because <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a middle </span>village, <span class="gemarra-regular">but were there no middle </span>village, they would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be considered as one. This appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna. </span>According to Rav Huna, the two villages should be considered as one even without the middle village, due to the double <span class="it-text">karpef</span>.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Huna </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: Wasn’t it stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to </span>that mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Idi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina said: </span>It does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>mean that the villages are <span class="gemarra-regular">actually aligned </span>in a row of <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>villages in a straight line. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>even if the middle village is off to one side and the outer villages are more than two <span class="it-text">karpef</span> lengths apart, <span class="gemarra-regular">we see </span>their spacing and make the following assessment: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">where, if the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">middle </span>village <span class="gemarra-regular">were placed between </span>the other two <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they were three </span>villages <span class="gemarra-regular">aligned </span>in a row, <span class="gemarra-regular">there would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be only </span>a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">141⅓ cubits between one and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the other, </span>then the <span class="gemarra-regular">middle </span>village <span class="gemarra-regular">turns the three </span>villages <span class="gemarra-regular">into one. </span>According to this explanation, the mishna can be understood even as a support for the opinion of Rav Huna.
With regard to this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to Abaye: How much </span>distance can <span class="gemarra-regular">there be between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an outer </span>village <span class="gemarra-regular">and the middle one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if the latter is still to combine the three villages into one? Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Two thousand cubits. </span>
Rava replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it you </span>yourself <span class="gemarra-regular">who said: It is reasonable </span>to rule <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, son of Rabba bar Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Huna, who said: </span>The Shabbat limit of a bow-shaped city is measured from the imaginary bowstring stretched between the two ends of the city, even if the distance between the center of the string and the center of the bow is <span class="gemarra-regular">more than two thousand cubits. </span>Why shouldn’t the three villages in this case be considered a single village also, even if they are separated by more than two thousand cubits? 
Abaye rejected the comparison: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can you compare? There, </span>in the case of the bow-shaped city, <span class="gemarra-regular">there are houses </span>that combine the city into a single unit, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are no houses </span>linking the outer villages. Therefore, if two villages are separated by more than two thousand cubits, the measure of the Shabbat limit, they cannot be considered a single entity.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Abaye: How much </span>distance can <span class="gemarra-regular">there be between </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">outer </span>village <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">outer </span>village? Abaye expressed surprise at this question: <span class="gemarra-regular">How much </span>distance can <span class="gemarra-regular">there be </span>between them? <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span>practical <span class="gemarra-regular">difference to you? Any </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">where, if the middle </span>village <span class="gemarra-regular">were placed between them, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there would be only </span>a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">141⅓ </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one and the other, </span>the middle village turns the three villages into one. Therefore, the critical detail is not the distance between the outer villages but the size of the middle village. 
Rava continued his line of questioning: Is this true <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the distance between the two outer villages is <span class="gemarra-regular">four thousand cubits? </span>Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: Yes. </span>Rava asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rav Huna say </span>the following with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a city shaped like a bow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: If </span>the distance <span class="gemarra-regular">between its two ends is less than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four thousand cubits, one measures </span>the Shabbat limit <span class="gemarra-regular">from the</span> imaginary <span class="gemarra-regular">bowstring </span>stretched between the two ends of the bow; <span class="gemarra-regular">and if not, one measures </span>the Shabbat limit <span class="gemarra-regular">from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bow </span>itself? This indicates that even if there is an uninterrupted string of houses linking the two ends of the city, if the two ends are separated by more than four thousand cubits, the distance is too great for it to be considered a single city. 
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: There, </span>in the case of the bow-shaped city, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>room <span class="gemarra-regular">to say: Fill </span>it in, as there is nothing with which to fill in the empty space between the two ends of the city. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of the villages, <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>room <span class="gemarra-regular">to say: Fill </span>it in, as the middle village is seen as though it were projected between the two outer villages, and therefore all three combine into a single village. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Safra said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Rava: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the people of </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Akistefon, for whom we measure the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>far <span class="gemarra-regular">end of </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ardeshir, and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> people of Ardeshir, for whom we measure the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the </span>far <span class="gemarra-regular">end of Akistefon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as though the two settlements were a single city; <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t there the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Tigris </span>River, <span class="gemarra-regular">which separates them by more than 141⅓ </span>cubits? How can two cities that are separated by more than two <span class="it-text">karpef</span>-lengths be considered a single entity? 
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">went out </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">showed </span>Rav Safra <span class="gemarra-regular">the foundations of a wall </span>of one of the cities, <span class="gemarra-regular">which were submerged in the Tigris </span>River <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span>a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">seventy cubits and a remainder </span>from the other city. In other words, the two cities were in fact linked through the remnants of a wall submerged in the river.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One may measure </span>a Shabbat limit <span class="gemarra-regular">only with a rope fifty cubits </span>long, <span class="gemarra-regular">no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> less and no more, </span>as will be explained in the Gemara. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may measure </span>the limit <span class="gemarra-regular">only at the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> level of one’s heart, </span>i.e., whoever comes to measure the limit must hold the rope next to his chest.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">one was measuring </span>the limit <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he reached a canyon or a fence, </span>the height of the fence and the depth of the canyon are not counted toward the two thousand cubits; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">he spans it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">resumes his measurement</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Two people hold the two ends of the rope straight across the canyon or the fence, and the distance is measured as though the area were completely flat. If <span class="gemarra-regular">one reached a hill, </span>he does not measure its height; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">he spans </span>the hill as if it were not there <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">resumes his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">measurement, </span>

Daf 58a

<span class="gemarra-regular">provided he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">go out beyond the </span>city’s Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, </span>as those watching the surveyor might mistakenly think the limit extends to that point.
<span class="gemarra-regular">If, </span>due to the width of the canyon or hill, <span class="gemarra-regular">he cannot span it, with regard to this </span>situation <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Dostai bar Yannai said in the name of Rabbi Meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: I heard that one may pierc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hills. </span>In other words, one measures the distance as if there were a hole from one side of the hill to the other, so that in effect, he measures only the horizontal distance and ignores the differences in elevation. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters, </span>that the Shabbat limit must be measured with a rope fifty cubits long, derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>They are derived from <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “The length of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> courtyard shall be one hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by fifty” </span>(Exodus 27:18). <span class="gemarra-regular">The Torah states: Measure with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a rope of fifty cubits, </span>i.e., the length and breadth of the courtyard must be measured “by fifty,” with a rope fifty cubits long.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>repetitive usage of the word fifty <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>to teach us something else, namely, that the area of a courtyard is equivalent to a square the size of the Tabernacle’s courtyard. To this end, the Torah states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Take </span>a square of <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty </span>cubits by fifty cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">and surround </span>it with the remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty </span>cubits in order to form a square, each side of which is just over seventy cubits long. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so, let the verse state: Fifty, fifty, </span>which would have sufficed to teach us the size and shape of a courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the significance of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">Fifty by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fifty? Conclude from this </span>that the verse comes to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>things, both the matter of the square courtyard and that the length of the rope used to measure the Shabbat limit should be fifty cubits long. 
We learned in the mishna: One may measure a Shabbat limit only with a rope fifty cubits long, <span class="gemarra-regular">not less and not more. It was taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">No less, because </span>a shorter rope improperly <span class="gemarra-regular">increases </span>the Shabbat limit, as the rope is likely to be stretched. <span class="gemarra-regular">And no more, because </span>a longer rope <span class="gemarra-regular">reduces </span>the limit, as the rope is likely to sag due to its weight. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi said: One may measure only with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a rope of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">afsakima</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">afsakima</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rabbi Abba said: </span>It is the <span class="gemarra-italic">nargil</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> plant. This name was also not widely known, and therefore the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">nargila</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Ya’akov said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">A palm tree </span>that has only <span class="gemarra-regular">one fibrous vine </span>wrapped around it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>a different version of the previous discussion, according to which the Gemara asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">afsakima</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Abba said: </span>It is the <span class="gemarra-italic">nargila</span> plant. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’akov </span>disagreed and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a palm tree </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">one fibrous vine. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya said: You have nothing better</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for measuring than iron chains</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as they do not stretch. <span class="gemarra-regular">But what shall we do, as the Torah states</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>“I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold a man <span class="gemarra-regular">with a measuring rope in his hand” </span>(Zechariah 2:5), from which it is derived that measurements must be made with a rope.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “And in the man’s hand a measuring reed</span> of six cubits long, of one cubit and a handbreadth each” (Ezekiel 40:5), which indicates that reeds may also be used for measuring? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That is </span>used <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span> measuring <span class="gemarra-regular">gates, </span>which are too narrow to be measured with lengthy ropes.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef taught</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">there are three </span>kinds of <span class="gemarra-regular">rope, </span>each required by <span class="it-text">halakha</span> for a different purpose: A rope <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">magag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a kind of bulrush reed; a rope <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">netzer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>made from fibrous palm vines; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a rope <span class="gemarra-regular">of flax. </span>
They are used for the following purposes: A rope <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">magag</span> is utilized <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the burning of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer, as we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">They would bind </span>the heifer <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a rope of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">maga</span><span class="gemarra-italic">g</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and place it on its woodpile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>where it would be burned after it was slaughtered. A rope <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">netzer</span> was required <span class="gemarra-regular">for a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sota</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a woman suspected of adultery, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna: Before the <span class="it-text">sota</span> is compelled to drink the bitter waters, her clothes are torn. <span class="gemarra-regular">And after that </span>a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">brings</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mitzri</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rope</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a rope made of reeds [<span class="it-text">netzarim</span>], <span class="gemarra-regular">and binds it above her breasts, </span>so that her garments will not fall. A rope <span class="gemarra-regular">of fla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">x</span> is used <span class="gemarra-regular">for measuring. </span>
It was stated in the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">measuring </span>the limit <span class="gemarra-regular">and he reached </span>a canyon or a fence, he spans the area as if it were completely flat and then resumes his measurement. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">it taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he resumes his measurement, </span>it may be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that if he cannot </span><span class="gemarra-regular">span it </span>because it is too wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">he goes to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a place where </span>it is narrower so that <span class="gemarra-regular">he can </span><span class="gemarra-regular">span it. And he spans it, and he </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">looks </span>for the spot at the same distance that is <span class="gemarra-regular">aligned </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with his </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">measurement</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he resumes </span>his measurement from there.
The Gemara comments that <span class="gemarra-regular">we have </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">learned this,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as the Sages taught </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who was measuring </span>the Shabbat limit <span class="gemarra-regular">and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> measurement reached a canyon, if he can span </span>the canyon <span class="gemarra-regular">with a rope of fifty cubits, </span>i.e., if the canyon is less than fifty cubits wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">he spans it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And if not, </span>i.e., if the valley is more than fifty cubits wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">he goes to a place where</span> it is narrower so that <span class="gemarra-regular">he can span it, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he spans it, and he </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">looks </span>for the spot at the same distance that aligns with his original measurement, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he resumes his measurement </span>from there.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the canyon was curve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> so that it surrounds the city on more than one side, and it cannot be spanned on the side where he wishes to measure the limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">he pierces and ascends, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pierces and descends, </span>thereby measuring the canyon’s width bit by bit. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he reached a wall, we do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say that he should pierce the wall </span>so that it can be precisely measured; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, he estimates </span>its width <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">leaves </span>and continues on. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna: If he reached a canyon or fence, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spans it and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">resumes his measurement</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Why is a precise measurement required there, whereas in the case of a wall, an estimate is sufficient? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">There</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in the mishna, we are dealing with a place whose <span class="gemarra-regular">use is convenient, </span>i.e., where the slope is relatively gentle so that the area can be crossed. Therefore, the area must actually be measured. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the wall’s <span class="gemarra-regular">use is not convenient. </span>Since one cannot walk through the wall, an estimate of its width is sufficient. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: They taugh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> the method of piercing <span class="gemarra-regular">only where a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">plumb line does not drop straight down, </span>i.e., where the canyon has a slope. 

Daf 58b

<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">a plumb line drops straight down</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., if the canyon wall is very steep, <span class="gemarra-regular">he measures </span>the width of the canyon <span class="gemarra-regular">properly </span>at the bottom of the canyon, without taking its walls into account. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> depth of a canyon </span>that may be spanned if it is not more than fifty cubits wide? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Up to <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand </span>cubits; but if it is deeper than that, the slope must be measured as well.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised an objection </span>from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If a canyon is up to <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hundred </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">deep and </span>up to <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">wide, one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may span it; and if not, one may not span </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it. </span>How could Rav Yosef say that the canyon may be spanned if its depth is less than two thousand cubits? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He stated </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; as it was taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: Even </span>if the canyon is <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">deep and fifty </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">wide, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one may span it.</span>
The Gemara cites an alternate version of the previous discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if the canyon is <span class="gemarra-regular">more than two thousand </span>cubits deep, it may be spanned. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with whose </span>opinion did Rav Yosef say this? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>where the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> disagree about the depth of a canyon that may be spanned, they refer to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">a plumb line does not drop straight down </span>and therefore there is reason to measure the slope. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>however, where Rav Yosef says that the canyon may be spanned even if it is more than two thousand cubits deep, he is referring to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">a plumb line</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> drops straight down</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And where a plumb line does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not drop straight down, how much </span>must it extend from the top of the canyon in order for the wall of the canyon to be considered a slope rather than a vertical wall? <span class="gemarra-regular">Avimi said: Four </span>cubits. If the bed of the canyon lies four cubits beyond the top edge of the canyon, the wall is sloped and must be included in the measurement. <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, Rami bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ezekiel taught, </span>based upon a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that the maximum run is <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>cubits.
We learned in the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he reached a hill, </span>he does not measure its height, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">he spans </span>the hill as if it were not there <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">resumes his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> measurement. Rava said: They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a hill that has an incline of ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>a run of <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, with regard to</span> a gentler <span class="gemarra-regular">hill, </span>e.g., one <span class="gemarra-regular">that has an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">incline of ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">within five </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">one must </span><span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>the hill <span class="gemarra-regular">properly, </span>i.e., he must include the slope itself in his measurement. 
The Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Natan, teaches a lenient </span>formulation of this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they only taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a hill that has an incline of ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>a run of <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, with regard to </span>a steeper <span class="gemarra-regular">hill that has an incline of ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span><span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>cubits, one need not take any precise measurements; instead, <span class="gemarra-regular">he estimates </span>the length of the hill, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">leaves </span>and continues measuring from the other side. 
We learned in the mishna that one may measure a canyon or hill located within the Shabbat limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that one does not go out beyond the limit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this restriction? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree, lest </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: The measurement of the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit comes to here. </span>Since people know that he set out to measure the Shabbat limit, if they see him measuring in a certain spot they will assume that the area is included in the Shabbat limit. 
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If, </span>due to the width of the canyon or hill, <span class="gemarra-regular">one cannot span it, </span>he may pierce it. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> which explains this procedure: <span class="gemarra-regular">How does one </span>figuratively <span class="gemarra-regular">pierce </span>a hill? Two people hold the two ends of a measuring rope. The one who is <span class="gemarra-regular">lower </span>down on the hill holds the rope <span class="gemarra-regular">at the level of his heart </span>while the one who is <span class="gemarra-regular">higher </span>holds it <span class="gemarra-regular">at the level of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his feet, </span>and they proceed to measure in this fashion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>Based on tradition, <span class="gemarra-regular">we hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may pierce only with a rope of four cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabba bar Avuh said: </span>Based on tradition, <span class="gemarra-regular">we hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not pierce </span>when measuring distances for the rite of the <span class="gemarra-regular">beheaded heifer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This rite is practiced when a murder victim is found, and it is not known who killed him. Judges measure the distance from the location of the corpse to the nearest town, in order to determine which town must perform the rite (Deuteronomy 21). Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not </span>pierce when measuring distances with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">cities of refuge, </span>in order to determine the boundaries within which an accidental murderer is protected from the blood redeemer (Numbers 32). <span class="gemarra-regular">Because </span>these measurements <span class="gemarra-regular">are from the Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>indirect methods of measurement are insufficient. The area must be measured as though it were flat. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One <span class="gemarra-regular">may measure </span>the Shabbat limit <span class="gemarra-regular">only with an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exper</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> surveyor. If it is discovered that the surveyor <span class="gemarra-regular">extended </span>the limit <span class="gemarra-regular">in one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> place and reduced it in another </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that the line marking the Shabbat limit is not straight, <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accepts </span>the measurement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the place where he extended </span>the limit and straightens the limit accordingly. Similarly, if the surveyor <span class="gemarra-regular">extended </span>the limit <span class="gemarra-regular">for one and reduced </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, one accepts the extended </span>measurement.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>a gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">slave </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>a gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">maidservant, </span>whose testimonies are generally considered unreliable, <span class="gemarra-regular">are trustworthy to say: The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat limit </span>extended <span class="gemarra-regular">until here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as the Sages did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not state the matter, </span>the laws of Shabbat limits, <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be stringent, but </span>rather <span class="gemarra-regular">to be lenient. </span>The prohibition to walk more than two thousand cubits is rabbinic in origin and is therefore interpreted leniently. 

Daf 59a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: Does this mean that in <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where he extended </span>the limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>the surveyor’s measurements are accepted, but in <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place where he reduced </span>the limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>his measurements are not accepted? If his extended measurement is accepted, his shortened measurement should certainly be accepted as well. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that the mishna means that the surveyor’s measurements are accepted <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where he extended </span>the limit, without concern that he might have erred (<span class="it-text">Tosafot</span>), and that the surveyor’s measurements are certainly accepted in places where he reduced the Shabbat limit.
We learned in the mishna: If the surveyor <span class="gemarra-regular">extended </span>the limit <span class="gemarra-regular">for one and reduced </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for another, </span>one accepts the extended measurement. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">need this as well? This </span>clause <span class="gemarra-regular">is the same as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>previous clause in the mishna. The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>If two surveyors measured the Shabbat limit and <span class="gemarra-regular">one extended </span>the Shabbat limit <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one reduced </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">one accepts </span>the measurements of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>surveyor <span class="gemarra-regular">who extended </span>it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>The measurements of the surveyor who extended the limit are accepted only <span class="gemarra-regular">as long as he does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> extend </span>the limit <span class="gemarra-regular">more than </span>the difference between <span class="gemarra-regular">the measure</span> of the Shabbat limit <span class="gemarra-regular">of the city </span>calculated <span class="gemarra-regular">as a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> diagonal </span>line from the corner of the city and as calculated as a straight line from the side of the city. If, however, the difference in measurements exceeds that amount, the Shabbat limit must be measured again. 
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">As the Sages did not state</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the matter, </span>the laws of Shabbat limits, <span class="gemarra-regular">to be stringent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but </span>rather <span class="gemarra-regular">to be lenient. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t</span> the opposite <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> state the matter, </span>the laws of Shabbat limits, <span class="gemarra-regular">to be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lenient but </span>rather <span class="gemarra-regular">to be stringent? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said </span>that there is no contradiction between these two statements: The very institution of Shabbat limits was enacted <span class="gemarra-regular">not to be </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">lenient </span>than <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah law, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">rather to be stringent </span>beyond <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Nonetheless, since <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat limits are rabbinic law, </span>the Sages permitted certain leniencies with regard to how the Shabbat limits are measured. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Although this chapter as a whole deals with <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> governing the joining of Shabbat boundaries, this mishna returns to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> governing a joining of courtyards. If <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> private </span><span class="gemarra-regular">city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which does not have many residents, grows and <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes </span>a heavily populated <span class="gemarra-regular">public </span>city, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> establish a joining of the courtyards for all of it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as long as it does not include a public domain as defined by Torah law. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">a public </span>city loses residents over time and <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes a private </span>city, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not establish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for all of it unless one maintains </span>an area <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>the <span class="it-text">eiru</span><span class="it-text">v</span> that is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">the city of Ḥadasha in Judea, which has fifty residents</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Carrying within the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is permitted, but it remains prohibited to carry in the area excluded from the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. The reason for this requirement is to ensure that the laws of <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> will not be forgotten. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says: </span>The excluded area need not be so large; rather, it is sufficient to exclude <span class="gemarra-regular">three courtyards </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">two houses </span>each. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a private city </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a public </span>city? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: For example, the Exilarch</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s village [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">de’iskarta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> was a small village set aside for the Exilarch’s family and attendants; since it was frequented by many people, it turned into a public city. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said to him: What is the reason </span>for bringing this example? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>large numbers of people <span class="gemarra-regular">are to be found at </span>the residence of <span class="gemarra-regular">the governor [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">harmana</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> in order to request licenses and authorizations, and <span class="gemarra-regular">they remind each other </span>of the reason it is permissible to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> there, and consequently they will not arrive at mistaken conclusions with regard to other places, then every city should have the same status, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire Jewish people are also found together on Shabbat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">morning </span>when they come to pray. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Naḥman said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">For example, the village of Natzu’i </span>was a private city belonging to a single individual before a large influx of residents turned it into a public city. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a private city</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> becomes public, and </span>a bona fide <span class="gemarra-regular">public domain passes through</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it, how does one establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for it? He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> places a side post from here, </span>one side of the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and side post from there, </span>the other side; <span class="gemarra-regular">or, </span>he places a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam from here, </span>one side of the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>another cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam from there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the other side. <span class="gemarra-regular">He may </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">carry </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">and place</span> them <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>these symbolic partitions, as the public domain is now considered like one of the courtyards of the city. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for half </span>the city; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>one may establish <span class="gemarra-regular">either </span>one <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">all of it or </span>separate ones for <span class="gemarra-regular">each alleyway separately</span> without including the other sections of the city.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: If <span class="gemarra-regular">it was </span>originally <span class="gemarra-regular">a public </span>city, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>remains <span class="gemarra-regular">a public </span>city,

<span class="gemarra-regular">and it has only one entrance, </span>as it is surrounded by a wall or enclosed by houses on all sides, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for all of it. </span>
The Gemara raises a question concerning this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> who holds <span class="gemarra-regular">that an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may be established </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for a public domai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> in this manner? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son of Rav Yehoshua, said: It is Rabbi Yehuda, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One who has two houses </span>opposite each other <span class="gemarra-regular">on two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sides of the public domain, </span>if he chooses, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may </span>create a private domain for himself in the public domain. He may <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>a ten-handbreadth high <span class="gemarra-regular">post from here, </span>on one side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">post from there, </span>the other side. This creates symbolic walls that provide the public domain with the legal status of a private domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one may place <span class="gemarra-regular">a beam </span>extending <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>one end of the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a beam from there, </span>the other end of the house, thereby creating symbolic partitions across the width of the street. In that way, one is permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">carry </span>objects <span class="gemarra-regular">and place </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between</span> the symbolic partitions, as he would in a private domain. The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: One may not establish an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the public domain in that </span>way. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> quoted above: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the city. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: They said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case where one wishes to divide the city <span class="gemarra-regular">according to its length. </span>Generally, a city had a public domain that ran straight across it, from the entrance on one side of the city to the entrance on its other side. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> rules that it is prohibited to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> separately for the residents of each side of the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if one wants to divide the city <span class="gemarra-regular">according to its width</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he may establish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for half the city. This distinction is made because in the first case the public domain that runs between the two halves is used by the residents of both halves, and therefore it joins the two into a single unit; in the second case, the residents of each half use only the half of the public domain located on their side and not the half of the public domain located on the other side.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with whose </span>opinion is this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva. As, if</span> it were <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, didn’t he say that a foot that is permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in its </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">place prohibits </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">even in a place</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is not its own? </span>Rabbi Akiva holds the following in the case of outer and inner courtyards, in which the residents of each courtyard established their own, independent <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>: Since the residents of the inner courtyard, who are permitted to carry in their own courtyard, may not carry in the outer courtyard despite the fact that they have rights of passage there, it is prohibited even for the residents of the outer courtyard to carry there. By the same logic, since the residents of each half of the city are prohibited to carry in the public domain of the city’s other half, despite the fact that they may travel there, it should be prohibited for everyone to carry there, and the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> should not be functional. 
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even if you say </span>it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, Rabbi Akiva stated </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">there only in </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two courtyards, one </span>farther <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>than <span class="gemarra-regular">the other, as the inner </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">has no other </span><span class="gemarra-regular">entrance. </span>Since the residents of the inner courtyard have no choice but to pass through the outer courtyard, the residents of the outer courtyard deny the residents of the inner courtyard exclusive use of their own courtyard; therefore, they can impose restrictions upon them. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>in the case of two halves of the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">these may go out through </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>part of the public domain on their side of the city, leading to one <span class="gemarra-regular">entrance </span>to the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these may go out through this </span>other part of the public domain, leading to the other <span class="gemarra-regular">entrance </span>to the city. Since the residents of each half do not have to use the portion of the public domain located in the other half, they do not impose any restrictions on the residents of the other half, even if they do in fact use it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>a different version of the previous discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Do not say that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>only if the city is divided <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its length that one may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for half the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if the city is divided <span class="gemarra-regular">according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to its width, one may establish </span>a separate <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for each half. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, even </span>if the city is divided <span class="gemarra-regular">according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to its width</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for half the city. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion is this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva. </span>The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if you say </span>it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>it is possible that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis stated </span>their opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">there only in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two courtyards, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one inside the other, as </span>the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the inner </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">can close the door </span>to the outer courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>only their own courtyard. In doing so, they impose no restrictions on the residents of the outer courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>with regard to the division of a city, <span class="gemarra-regular">are they able to move the public domain from here? </span>Since the residents of each half cannot be prevented from using the public domain located in the other half, even the Rabbis would agree that the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is ineffective. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the previously cited <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> must <span class="gemarra-regular">either </span>be established <span class="gemarra-regular">for all of it or </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">each alleyway separately. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for half</span> the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is not </span>permissible? The residents of each half <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibit </span>residents of the <span class="gemarra-regular">othe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> from carrying, due to the fact that all the residents may use both halves. Similarly, even if they establish a separate <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">each alleyway, </span>the residents should still <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibit </span>residents of the <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>from carrying, as residents of one alleyway commonly enter other alleyways as well. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">erected a partitio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> at the entrance to the alleyway as an indication that they do not want to be connected to the other alleyways. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">like that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Idi bar Avin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: One of the residents of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an alleyway, who made a partition for his entrance </span>to the alleyway as a sign that he does not intend to carry from his house to the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibit the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">residents of the alleyway </span>from carrying there if he does not join in their <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. The reason for this is that this resident has demonstrated his desire to renounce his share of the alleyway. 
It was taught in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">it was </span>originally <span class="gemarra-regular">a public </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">a public </span>city, and it has only one entrance to the public domain, one may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the entire city. The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for Rabbi Ḥiyya’s city and did not leave any </span><span class="gemarra-regular">section </span>of the city <span class="gemarra-regular">out </span>of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: What is the reason that the Master acted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>manner? Why didn’t you exclude a section of the city from the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, as required in a public city?
Rabbi Zeira <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">Elders told me </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥiyya bar Asi </span>used to <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>city without excluding any section of it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>to myself: If he would establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the whole city, I can <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from this </span>that it was originally <span class="gemarra-regular">a private city and </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes a public</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one. </span>Therefore, it is permitted to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the entire city. 
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Those </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">Elders told me </span>that the reason was different: <span class="gemarra-regular">There was a particular garbage </span>dump <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one side </span>of the public domain, which blocked one of the entrances, leaving only one entrance to the public domain. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">now that the garbage </span>dump <span class="gemarra-regular">has been cleared away</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it has two entrances</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited</span> to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the whole city without excluding a section from the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. Rabbi Zeira <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: It was not on my mind</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., I was unaware that this was the situation.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ami bar Adda from Harpanya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raised a dilemma before Rabba: </span>If a public domain has <span class="gemarra-regular">a ladder on one side, </span>to allow people to scale the wall that blocks it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and an entrance on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> other side</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is it considered a public domain that is open on both sides? Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said as follows: A ladder</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has the status of an entrance, </span>and therefore the public domain is considered open on both sides.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said to them: Do not listen to him. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said as follows: A ladder </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has the status of an entrance </span>in certain cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it has the status of a partition </span>in other cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">It has the status of a partition </span>in the case that <span class="gemarra-regular">we mentioned, </span>where there is a ladder at the end of a public domain. In this case, the ladder is not considered an entrance and therefore the public domain is considered closed at that end. <span class="gemarra-regular">It has the status</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of an entrance in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a ladder between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two courtyards. </span>If the residents of the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">wish, </span>they may join the two courtyards by means of the ladder and <span class="gemarra-regular">establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they wish, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>courtyards may each <span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span>a separate <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did Rav Naḥman </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this? Didn’t Rav Naḥman say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">residents of </span>the ground floor of <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and residents of a balcony, </span>i.e., the floor above the ground floor, <span class="gemarra-regular">who forgot </span>

Daf 60a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not establish </span>a joint <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, if there is a partition </span><span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths wide <span class="gemarra-regular">in front of </span>the entrance to the balcony, the balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">does not prohibit </span>the residents of the courtyard from carrying, as each area is considered to be independent. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if not, </span>the balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibits </span>the residents of the courtyard from carrying in the courtyard. This indicates that a ladder between two courtyards is always considered an entrance, even when that policy leads to a stringent ruling, unless the two areas are separated by a partition. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what are we dealing here? With </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> balcony is not ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high </span>from the ground. Consequently, it does not constitute a domain in its own right, and it is part of the courtyard.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">balcony is not ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high </span>and is therefore part of the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">when one places a partition, what of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it? </span>The balcony should nevertheless be considered part of the courtyard. The Gemara answers: We are dealing here <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a balcony that is entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">fenced off </span>except for a section <span class="gemarra-regular">up to ten cubits </span>wide, which serves as an entrance. In that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the residents of the balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">place</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a partition </span>at this entrance, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">remove themselves </span>entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the courtyard. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a wall that one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lined with ladders</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even </span>along a length of <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than ten </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>still retains <span class="gemarra-regular">the status of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">partition. </span>The ladders do not constitute an opening that is more than ten cubits wide, which would cause the wall to be regarded as breached and would invalidate the wall as a partition. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beruna raised a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contradiction to Rav Yehuda in the winepress at Rav Ḥanina’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s house: Did Shmuel </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that such a wall <span class="gemarra-regular">has the status of a partition? Didn’t Rav Naḥman </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the residents of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a balcony and the residents of a courtyard who forgot </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and did not establish </span>a joint <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, if there is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a partition </span>four handbreadths wide <span class="gemarra-regular">in front </span>of the entrance to the balcony, the balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">does not prohibit </span>the residents of the courtyard to carry; <span class="gemarra-regular">and if not, it prohibits </span>the residents of the courtyard from carrying? This indicates that a ladder is considered an entrance, as the courtyard and the balcony are considered connected. 
Rav Yehuda replied in the same manner as above: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the balcony is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high, </span>and that is why it is regarded as connected to the courtyard. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the balcony is not ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high, when he places</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a partition, what of it? </span>The balcony should nevertheless be considered part of the courtyard. The Gemara answers: We are dealing here <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a balcony that is entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">fenced </span><span class="gemarra-regular">off </span>except for a section <span class="gemarra-regular">up to ten cubits </span>wide, which serves as an entrance. In that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the residents of the balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">place a partition </span>at this entrance, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">remove themselves </span>entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the courtyard. 
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">certain residents of </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Kakunya came before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Provide us with someone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who will establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for our city. </span>The city had originally been a public city and had turned into a private one, requiring that part of the city be excluded from the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Abaye: Go, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for them, and see </span>to it <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is no outcry against it in the study hall, </span>i.e., make sure the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is valid beyond any doubt. <span class="gemarra-regular">He went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">saw </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">certain houses opened to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the river </span>and not to the city. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Let these </span>houses serve as <span class="gemarra-regular">the section excluded </span>from the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for the city. </span>
Abaye subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">retracted </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>This cannot be done, as <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of it; by inference, if they wanted to establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for the entire city, <span class="gemarra-regular">they would have been able </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to establish </span>such <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>if not for the requirement to exclude a section of the city from the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. However, these houses, which do not open to the city, could not have joined in an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with the rest of the city in any case, and therefore they cannot serve as the excluded section. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, I will create windows </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for them </span>between the courtyards of their houses and the rest of the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that if they want to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> with the rest of the city <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">way of the windows, they can establish </span>such <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and then these houses will be fit to serve as the excluded section. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">He</span> subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">retracted </span>again and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">is not necessary, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabba bar Avuh established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the entire </span>city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Meḥoza, </span>which was a public city that had become a private one, <span class="gemarra-regular">neighborhood by neighborhood, due to the </span>fact that the neighborhoods were separated by <span class="gemarra-regular">ditches </span>from which <span class="gemarra-regular">the cattle </span>would feed. In other words, Rabba bar Avuh established a separate <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for each neighborhood without excluding any of them, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he maintained that <span class="gemarra-regular">each one was an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">excluded section for the other. And although </span>the neighborhoods <span class="gemarra-regular">would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not have been able to establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together even <span class="gemarra-regular">if they wanted </span>to, due to the ditches separating them, the neighborhoods were still able to serve as excluded areas for each other.
<span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">retracted</span> once again and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The two cases <span class="gemarra-regular">are not </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable. There, </span>in Meḥoza, <span class="gemarra-regular">if they wanted, </span>they could have <span class="gemarra-regular">established </span>a single <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by way of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">roofs; </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>houses <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> with the other houses of the city, and <span class="gemarra-regular">therefore we must create </span><span class="gemarra-regular">windows </span>for them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">retracted </span>yet again and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Windows </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are also not necessary. As, that storehouse of stra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> belonged to Mar bar Pofidata from Pumbedita was designated as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the section excluded from </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> arranged for the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pumbedita, </span>which proves that it is not necessary for the excluded section to be one that could have been included in an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with the rest of the city. 
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what the Master </span>meant when he <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to me: See </span>to it <span class="gemarra-regular">that there is no outcry</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> against it in the study hall. </span>Abaye now understood the many factors that had to be considered and how wary one must be of reaching a hasty conclusion.
The mishna stated that if a public city becomes a private city, one may not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for all of it <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>an area <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> which is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">the city of Ḥadash</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> in Judea. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: There was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a certain city in Judea and its name was Ḥadasha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and it had fifty residents </span>including <span class="gemarra-regular">men, women, and children</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And the Sages would use it to measure </span>the size of the section that must be excluded from an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it </span>itself was <span class="gemarra-regular">the excluded section </span>of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> of a larger city that was adjacent to it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: As for <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥadasha, what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is it permissible to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for Ḥadasha itself without excluding a section of the city from the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? The Gemara answers: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥadasha, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">just as it was the excluded section of the larger </span>city, <span class="gemarra-regular">the larger </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">was also the excluded section of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the smaller </span>city. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the question pertains to a small city <span class="gemarra-regular">like Ḥadash</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> that stands by itself, not in proximity to a larger city: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Does a small city require an excluded section or not? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna and Rav Yehuda </span>disagreed about this issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">One said: It requires an excluded section; and one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: It does not require an excluded section</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
It is stated in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>The excluded area must be large enough to include at least <span class="gemarra-regular">three courtyards </span>with two houses each. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥama bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gurya said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Even one house and one courtyard </span>suffice. The Gemara expresses surprise at the wording of this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Can it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one courtyard </span>even without a house is sufficient? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>correct it and <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">house in one courtyard.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yitzḥak </span>based on oral <span class="gemarra-regular">tradition or </span>his own <span class="gemarra-regular">logic? </span>Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What </span>practical <span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>does Rabbi Yitzḥak’s source make <span class="gemarra-regular">to us</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him, </span>quoting a well-known adage: When you <span class="gemarra-regular">study Talmud is it </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">a song?; </span>Is the material you study like the lyrics of a song that you do not understand? It is proper to investigate all aspects of the statements of the Sages, regardless of the practical ramifications. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who was to the east </span>of his home when Shabbat began, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he had said to his son </span>before Shabbat: <span class="gemarra-regular">Establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me to the west; </span>or, if he was <span class="gemarra-regular">to the west </span>of his home <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he had said to his son: Establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me to the east, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits from his </span>current location <span class="gemarra-regular">to his house, and </span>the distance <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is greater than this, he is permitted </span>to walk <span class="gemarra-regular">to his house, </span>and from there he may walk two thousand cubits in every direction, <span class="gemarra-regular">but it is prohibited </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>walk to the spot where his son had deposited <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
If the distance from one’s current location <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is two thousand cubits, </span>and the distance <span class="gemarra-regular">to his house</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is greater than this, he is prohibited </span>from walking to his house, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he is permitted to </span>walk to the spot of <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and from there he may walk two thousand cubits in every direction. In other words, with regard to the Shabbat limit, one’s place of residence for Shabbat cannot be more than two thousand cubits from his physical location when Shabbat begins. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who places his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the outskirts of the city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., within an area of slightly more than seventy cubits surrounding the city, it is as though <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not done anything. </span>The two thousand cubits of one’s Shabbat limit are measured from the edge of the outskirts of the city even if there is no <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, and one therefore gains nothing from placing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> within this area. 
If, however, <span class="gemarra-regular">he placed </span>his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">outside the</span> city’s <span class="gemarra-regular">boundary, even </span>if he placed it only <span class="gemarra-regular">one cubit </span>beyond the city, 

Daf 60b

<span class="gemarra-regular">what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he gains </span>in distance through his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> on one side of the city <span class="gemarra-regular">he loses </span>on the other side.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span>might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind</span> to say that when the mishna states that one was standing <span class="gemarra-regular">to the east, </span>it means that he was standing <span class="gemarra-regular">to the east of his house </span>and that he had instructed his son to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> to the west of his house. Similarly, when it states that he was standing <span class="gemarra-regular">to the west, </span>it means that he was positioned <span class="gemarra-regular">to the west of his house </span>and that he had instructed his son to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> to the east of his house. In such a case, the person’s house is located between him and his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
If so, the question arises: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>the mishna’s case where there is a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits from his </span>current location <span class="gemarra-regular">to his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> house, and </span>the distance <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is greater than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this, you can find, as </span>it is possible <span class="gemarra-regular">that he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> can reach his house </span>without traveling two thousand cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he cannot reach his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. But where do you find</span> a case where there is a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits between him and his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>the distance <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his house is greater than this? </span>The person’s house is located between him and his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Do you think </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">to the east </span>means that he was standing <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> east of his house, and to the west </span>means that he was standing <span class="gemarra-regular">to the west of his house? No</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, to the east </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">to the east of his son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who is depositing his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for him, and <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> west means to the west of his son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava bar Rav Sheila said: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">to the east </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">to the east of his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and to the west </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">to the west </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of his house, </span>the mishna can be understood as referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a case where his house stood </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">a diagonal </span>line in relation to the person and his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. In that case, although he is to the west of his house and the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is located to its east, he can still be closer to his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> than he is to his house.
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who places his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> within the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> outskirt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of the city has not accomplished anything. However, if he places it outside the city limits, it is effective. The Gemara expresses surprise: <span class="gemarra-regular">Can it enter your mind </span>that the mishna is dealing with a case where one placed his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">outside the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit? </span>If the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is outside the Shabbat limit as measured from his physical location at the onset of Shabbat, he cannot access it on Shabbat; it is therefore ineffective in establishing his Shabbat residence. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>correct it and <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>as follows: If one placed his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>the city’s <span class="gemarra-regular">outskirts, </span>i.e., beyond the area of slightly more than seventy cubits surrounding the city, the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is effective in establishing his Shabbat residence at that location. 
We learned in the next clause of the mishna concerning one who places his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> even one cubit beyond the city’s boundary: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which he gains </span>on one side of the city <span class="gemarra-regular">he loses </span>on the other. The Gemara expresses surprise: Does that mean that only <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which he gains </span>on one side he loses on the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">and no more? Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who places his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> within</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the outskirts of the city, he has not done anything</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> if, however, <span class="gemarra-regular">he placed it outside the outskirts</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the city, even one cubit </span>outside, <span class="gemarra-regular">he gains that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubit and loses the entire city because the measure of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the city is included in the measure of his </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit? </span>If one’s Shabbat residence had been in the city, the two thousand cubits of his Shabbat limit would have been measured from the edge of the city’s outskirts; now that he has established his Shabbat residence outside the city, the city itself is included in the two thousand cubits, and he may lose far more on that side than he will gain on the other side.
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where his measure </span>of two thousand cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">terminated in the middle of the city; </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where his measure terminated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at the </span>far <span class="gemarra-regular">end of the city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion stated by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Idi, as Rabbi Idi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> measuring </span>the two thousand cubits of his Shabbat limit from the location of his Shabbat residence outside the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his measure terminated in the middle of the city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he has only half the city, </span>i.e., he may walk only to the end of his two thousand cubits. If, however, <span class="gemarra-regular">his measure terminated at the </span>far <span class="gemarra-regular">end of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular">the entire city is regarded as four</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits, and he completes the rest </span>of the Shabbat limit on the other side of the city.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Idi said: These are nothing more than words</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of prophecy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., I do not see the logic behind this statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>difference is it <span class="gemarra-regular">to me</span> if the measure <span class="gemarra-regular">terminated in the middle of the city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, or </span>if it <span class="gemarra-regular">terminated at the </span>far <span class="gemarra-regular">end of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> city? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>They are not words of prophecy, as <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>cases <span class="gemarra-regular">were taught </span>in the following mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> residents of a large city may walk through an entire</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> small city </span>that is fully included within its Shabbat limit; the small city is considered as though it were four cubits, and the rest of the Shabbat limit is measured from the other side of the city. 

Daf 61a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And the residents of a small city may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> walk through an entire large city.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this difference? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it not because these, </span>the residents of the small city, <span class="gemarra-regular">their measure </span>of two thousand cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">terminated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the middle of the </span>large <span class="gemarra-regular">city, </span>and therefore they may walk only to the end of their two thousand cubits; <span class="gemarra-regular">and these, </span>the residents of the large city, <span class="gemarra-regular">their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> measure </span>of two thousand cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">terminated at the </span>far <span class="gemarra-regular">end</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the </span>small <span class="gemarra-regular">city, </span>allowing them to walk through the entire city as though it were four cubits and complete the two thousand cubit measure of their Shabbat limit on the other side of the city? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Idi, </span>who said that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s statement has no source, may hold that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the two cases with the same formulation. Just as it states: <span class="gemarra-regular">The residents of</span> a large city may walk through an entire small city, it similarly states: <span class="gemarra-regular">The residents of </span>a small city may walk through an entire large city. His version of the mishna did not state that the residents of a small city may not walk through an entire large city. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he establishes </span>the mishna as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who placed</span> his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> inside the other city. Consequently, that city becomes his Shabbat residence, and he may walk anywhere in that city and an additional two thousand cubits beyond it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we did not learn </span>anything about <span class="gemarra-regular">one who was measuring</span> two thousand cubits from his Shabbat residence outside the city, in which case it makes a difference whether the entire city is within his two thousand cubits or whether only part of it is within this limit. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> did we <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>learn in the mishna about one who was measuring? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as for one who is measuring </span>his Shabbat limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to whom </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one gives him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two thousand cubits, </span>that applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even if the end of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his measurement terminates in </span>the middle of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cave? </span>Although a cave has the status of a private domain, he may enter only the part of the cave that is within his two thousand cubits. This case is directly parallel to the case of one whose two thousand cubits end in the middle of a city. 
The Gemara answers: Although there is a source for the case of one whose limit ends in the middle of a city, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary for </span>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to teach the case where one’s measure ends at <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>far <span class="gemarra-regular">end of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the city, </span>in which case the entire city is regarded as four cubits and the rest of the Shabbat limit is completed on the other side of the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we did not learn </span>anything about such a case. 
With regard to the mishna cited above, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: One who teaches </span>the following in the second clause: <span class="gemarra-regular">The residents of </span>a small city may walk through an entire large city, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">err </span>in his rendering of the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: The residents </span>of a small city <span class="gemarra-regular">may not </span>walk through an entire large city, also <span class="gemarra-regular">does not err</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Both renderings are plausible.
Rav Naḥman explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who teaches: The residents of </span>a small city may walk through an entire large city, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not err, as he establishes </span>the mishna as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who places </span>his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> inside the other city. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one who teaches: The residents of </span>a small city <span class="gemarra-regular">may not </span>walk through an entire large city also <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not err, as he establishes </span>the mishna as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one who measures </span>his Shabbat limit and arrives at the city from the outside. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete and it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teaches the following: The residents of a large city may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">walk </span>through <span class="gemarra-regular">an entire small city, but the residents of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a small city may not walk </span>through <span class="gemarra-regular">an entire large </span><span class="gemarra-regular">city. In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>It was said <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to one who was measuring </span>his two thousand cubits from his Shabbat residence. <span class="gemarra-regular">But one who was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the large city and placed his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">small city, </span>and similarly <span class="gemarra-regular">one who was in the small </span><span class="gemarra-regular">city and placed his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the large city, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may walk </span>through <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire </span>city in which he placed his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and beyond it two thousand cubits.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said that Rami bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Abba said that Rav Huna said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">city located on the edge of a ravine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is a barrier four </span>cubits high <span class="gemarra-regular">in front of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one measures its </span>Shabbat limit <span class="gemarra-regular">from the edge </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the ravine, </span>as it is considered the border of the city. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>a barrier four cubits high in front of it, the Shabbat limit <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> measured from the entrance of </span>each person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">house, </span>as the city is not considered a permanent settlement. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to him: You told us with regard to </span>this case that a <span class="gemarra-regular">barrier four cubits </span>high is required. <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is different </span>about this case that it requires a barrier that is higher <span class="gemarra-regular">than all other barriers, </span>which must reach a height of only <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: There, use </span>of the place <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not frightening; here, use </span>of the place <span class="gemarra-regular">is frightening. </span>Generally, partitions serve a symbolic function, and therefore it is sufficient for the partition to be four handbreadths high. In this case, however, it is frightening to stand along the edge of the ravine without a protective barrier, and therefore a barrier four cubits high must be constructed for the safety of the residents. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: From where do I </span>derive to <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted the residents of Geder, </span>situated at the top of a slope, <span class="gemarra-regular">to descend </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥamtan, </span>situated at the bottom of the slope, but <span class="gemarra-regular">the residents of Ḥamtan may not ascend to Geder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? Is it not because these, </span>the inhabitants of Geder, <span class="gemarra-regular">constructed a barrier </span>at the lower edge of their city, <span class="gemarra-regular">and these, </span>the members of Ḥamtan, <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not construct a barrier </span>at the upper edge of their city? Consequently, the residents of Geder measured their Shabbat limit from their barrier, and Ḥamtan was included in their two thousand cubits. The residents of Ḥamtan had to measure their Shabbat limits from their homes, and therefore Geder was not within their two thousand cubit limit.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: </span>This ruling was issued not due to their respective Shabbat limits, but rather because <span class="gemarra-regular">the residents of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Geder would assault [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">metatreg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the residents of Ḥamtan. And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>does it mean that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>the residents of Geder to descend to Ḥamtan, but not vice versa? <span class="gemarra-regular">He instituted </span>this. In other words, this was not a halakhic ruling, but rather an ordinance instituted to protect the public welfare and prevent fighting. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi instituted this ordinance only for Shabbat and not for the rest of the week? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Drunkenness is common on </span>Shabbat, when people eat to their heart’s content. Therefore, there is a greater chance of violent behavior. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the residents of Geder <span class="gemarra-regular">go to </span>Ḥamtan, <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will assault </span>the residents there; of what use, then, is this ordinance? The Gemara answers, citing a popular saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dog </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in its place will not bark</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for seven years. </span>On its own turf, a dog barks readily, but it becomes scared in unfamiliar surroundings and remains silent. Similarly, the people of Geder are not nearly as bold when they visit Ḥamtan as they are in their own town. 
The Gemara asks: If so, we should be concerned about the reverse scenario, that <span class="gemarra-regular">now too, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> residents of Ḥamtan, </span>in their home territory, <span class="gemarra-regular">will </span>take revenge and <span class="gemarra-regular">assault the residents of Geder. </span>The Gemara answers: The people of Geder <span class="gemarra-regular">would not be submissive to such </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an extent. </span>While visiting Ḥamtan, they would not initiate fights, but they would certainly fight back if they were attacked. Consequently, the people of Ḥamtan would not dare initiate hostilities with them. Therefore, there is no concern about the safety of either group. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Safra said: </span>Geder <span class="gemarra-regular">was a city shaped like a bow, </span>whose two ends were separated by less than four thousand cubits. The empty space of the bow was viewed as though it were filled with houses, and its Shabbat limit was measured from the imaginary bowstring stretched between the two ends of the bow. Consequently, Ḥamtan was included in its Shabbat limit, and the residents of Geder were permitted to go there on Shabbat. With regard to the inhabitants of Ḥamtan, however, that same area between the ends of Geder was viewed as empty space, and therefore the houses of Geder along the arc of the bow were beyond their Shabbat limit.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Dimi bar Ḥinana said: </span>The people of Geder were <span class="gemarra-regular">residents </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a large city, and </span>the people of Ḥamtan were <span class="gemarra-regular">residents of a small city. </span>Consequently, the residents of the large city, Geder, could walk through all of Ḥamtan, the small city; but the residents of Ḥamtan could walk only through part of Geder, as explained previously.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana taught it that way, </span>as stated previously; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Tavyomi taught it </span>more concisely, in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">way: Rav Safra and Rav Dimi bar Ḥinana </span>disagreed about the matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>Geder <span class="gemarra-regular">was a city </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shaped like a bow; and one </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The people of Ḥamtan <span class="gemarra-regular">were residents of a small city and </span>the people of Geder <span class="gemarra-regular">were residents of a large city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The residents of a large city may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">walk through an entire small city, and the residents of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a small city may walk through an entire large city, </span>even if part of it is located more than two thousand cubits from their city. <span class="gemarra-regular">How so? One who was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in a large city and placed his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">small city, </span>or one who was <span class="gemarra-regular">in a small city </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and placed his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a large city, may walk</span> through <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire </span>city in which he placed his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits beyond it, </span>as the entire city is considered as though it were only four cubits.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Akiva says: He has only two thousand cubits from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> place of his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as the actual area of the city is included in the calculation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva said to</span> the Rabbis: Do <span class="gemarra-regular">you not concede to me </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who places his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a cave has only two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thousand cubits from the place of his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and that consequently the entire cave is not considered as merely four cubits?
The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: When </span>does this apply? <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the cave <span class="gemarra-regular">has no residents</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it has residents, </span>it is considered as though it were only four cubits, and <span class="gemarra-regular">one may walk </span>through <span class="gemarra-regular">all of it and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits beyond it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Consequently, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> placed <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>a cave <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>sometimes <span class="gemarra-regular">more lenient than </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> placed in the area <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>the cave. If one places his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> inside a cave that has residents, he has two thousand cubits beyond the cave; if he places it above the cave, where there are no residents, he has only two thousand cubits from the place of his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And as for one who is measuring</span> his Shabbat limit, with regard to whom the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">one gives him two thousand cubits, </span>that measurement applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even if the end of his measurement terminates in </span>the middle of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cave. </span>He may not walk further into the cave, even if the cave is inhabited. 

Daf 61b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that Shmuel said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one established his Shabbat residence in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a desolate cit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> whose walls are still standing, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Rabbis he may walk through all of it </span>as though it were four cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he may walk an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits beyond it. </span>If, however, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">placed his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiru</span><span class="gemarra-italic">v</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in a desolate city, he has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">only two thousand cubits from the place of his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Rabbis distinguish between one who establishes his Shabbat residence by actually being present in that location at the onset of Shabbat and one who does so by placing his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> there before Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: Whether he established</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his Shabbat residence </span>through his physical presence <span class="gemarra-regular">or he </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">placed his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> there, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may walk through all of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits beyond it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>based upon the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva said to </span>the Rabbis: Do <span class="gemarra-regular">you not concede</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to me </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who places his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cave has only two thousand cubits from the place of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? They said to him: When </span>does this apply? <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the cave <span class="gemarra-regular">has no residents. </span>Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">when it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has no residents </span>the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">concede to </span>Rabbi Akiva that one has only two thousand cubits from the place of his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. This contradicts Rabbi Elazar’s assertion that, according to the Rabbis, even if one places his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in the abandoned city, he may walk through all of it and another two thousand cubits beyond it. 
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of the qualification that it <span class="gemarra-regular">has no residents? </span>It means that the place <span class="gemarra-regular">is not fit for residence. </span>If, however, the city is suitable for habitation, it is considered like four cubits even if it is currently uninhabited. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another difficulty from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one established his Shabbat residence </span>through his physical presence <span class="gemarra-regular">in a city, even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is as large as Antioch</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">in a cave, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>particularly large, <span class="gemarra-regular">like the Cave of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Zedekiah, king of Judah, he may walk through all of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand cubits beyond it. </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a city </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to</span> that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cave: Just as a cave is </span>presumably <span class="gemarra-regular">desolate, </span>i.e., uninhabited, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too the city </span>must be one that <span class="gemarra-regular">is desolate. And </span>only in the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he established his Shabbat residence </span>through his physical presence would <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> apply; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if he merely <span class="gemarra-regular">placed </span>his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> there, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>he may not measure his two thousand cubits from the edge of the city. 
The Gemara continues clarifying the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose</span> opinion is this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, why </span>did the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>teach the case of a <span class="gemarra-regular">desolate </span>city? <span class="gemarra-regular">Even</span> if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">inhabited, </span>the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>apply, as Rabbi Akiva holds that even if one placed his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in an inhabited city, he has only two thousand cubits from the place of his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>nonetheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason is that one established his Shabbat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">residence </span>through his physical presence. In such a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>one may walk through the entire city and another two thousand cubits beyond it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if one merely <span class="gemarra-regular">placed </span>his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> there, he would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be permitted to walk more than two thousand cubits from his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, which would contradict the opinion of Rabbi Elazar. 
The Gemara rejects this argument and argues that the initial inference was incorrect. <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a city </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cave. Rather, say </span>that it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a cave </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to a city: Just as the city </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>presumably <span class="gemarra-regular">inhabited, so too the cave </span>must be one that is <span class="gemarra-regular">inhabited. </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is then in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, who said </span>that if one merely places his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in the cave, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has only</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two thousand cubits from the place of his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>However, if <span class="gemarra-regular">one established his Shabbat residence </span>there through his physical presence, even Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes </span>that the entire cave is considered as though it were four cubits, and he may walk two thousand cubits beyond the cave.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t the </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies even to a cave <span class="gemarra-regular">like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Cave of Zedekiah, </span>which was uninhabited? The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a cave that is <span class="gemarra-regular">like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Cave of Zedekiah </span>in one respect <span class="gemarra-regular">and not like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Cave of Zedekiah </span>in other respects. It is <span class="gemarra-regular">like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Cave of Zedekiah </span>in that the cave is as <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>as that one. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Cave of Zedekiah, as there, </span>with regard to Zedekiah’s cave, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">desolate, and here </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a cave that is <span class="gemarra-regular">inhabited.</span>
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">found the residents of Mavrakhta placing their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the synagogu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Beit Agovar. He said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them: Place </span>your <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">farther </span>into the synagogue, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> more will be permitted to you, </span>as the Shabbat limit is measured from the spot where the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is deposited. Mar Yehuda holds that even when an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is placed in an inhabited city, the two thousand cubits are measured from the location of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> rather than from the edge of the city.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him: Argumentative one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">!</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> With</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, nobody is concerned about</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>as the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. Consequently, no matter where one places his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in a city, the entire city is considered as though it were four cubits, and he is permitted to walk two thousand cubits beyond the edge of the city. 

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who resides </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with a gentile in </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, or </span>one who lives in the same courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">with one who does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accept </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>even though he is not a gentile, such as a Samaritan [<span class="it-text">Kuti</span>], <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it prohibited for him </span>to carry from his own house into the courtyard or from the courtyard into his house, unless he rents this person’s rights in the courtyard, as will be explained below. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: Actually, </span>the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">does not render it prohibited </span>for one to carry, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless there are two Jews </span>living in the same courtyard who themselves would <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibit one another </span>from carrying if there were no <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. In such a case, the presence of the gentile renders the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> ineffective. However, if only one Jew lives there, the gentile does not render it prohibited for him to carry in the courtyard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving a certain Sadduce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lived with us in </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway in Jerusalem, </span>who renounced his rights to the alleyway before Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Father </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to us: Hurry and take out </span>your <span class="gemarra-regular">utensils to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the alleyway </span>to establish possession of it, <span class="gemarra-regular">before he </span>changes his mind and <span class="gemarra-regular">takes out </span>his own utensils so as to reclaim his rights, in which case <span class="gemarra-regular">he would render </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it prohibited for you to </span>use the entire alleyway. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>Rabban Gamliel’s father spoke to them <span class="gemarra-regular">with a different formulation, </span>saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">Hurry and do </span>whatever <span class="gemarra-regular">you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must do in the alleyway </span>prior to Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">before he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> takes out </span>his utensils <span class="gemarra-regular">and renders it prohibited for you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>use the alleyway. In other words, you may not bring out utensils to the alleyway at all on Shabbat, as the institution of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> cannot be used in the neighborhood of a Sadducee. This is because, even if he renounced his rights to the alleyway, he can always retract and reclaim them. 

Daf 62a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye bar Avin and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ḥinana bar Avin were sitting, and Abaye was sitting</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> beside them, and they sat and said: Granted, </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>the author of the unattributed mishna, is clear, as <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the residence of a gentile</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is considered a </span>significant <span class="gemarra-regular">residence. </span>In other words, the gentile living in the courtyard is considered a resident who has a share in the courtyard. Since he cannot join in an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with the Jew, he renders it prohibited for the Jew to carry from his house to the courtyard or from the courtyard to his house. Consequently, the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>Jew living in the courtyard is <span class="gemarra-regular">no different</span> from the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>Jews living there. In both cases, the gentile renders it prohibited for carrying. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, what does he hold? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>you say <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the residence of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gentile is considered a </span>significant <span class="gemarra-regular">residence, he should prohibit </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>when there is only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>Jew living in the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is not considered a </span>significant <span class="gemarra-regular">residence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he should not prohibit </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>when there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span> Jews living there. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to them: </span>Your basic premise is based on a faulty assumption. <span class="gemarra-regular">Does Rabbi Meir </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the residence of a gentile is considered </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>significant <span class="gemarra-regular">residence? Wasn’t it taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The courtyard of a gentile is like the pen of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., just as an animal pen does not render it prohibited to carry in a courtyard, so too, the gentile’s residence in itself does not impose restrictions on a Jew.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this explanation must be rejected, and the dispute in the mishna should be understood differently: <span class="gemarra-regular">Everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the residence of gentile </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not considered a </span>significant <span class="gemarra-regular">residence, and here they disagree </span><span class="gemarra-regular">about a decree </span>that was issued <span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span>the Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the gentile’s <span class="gemarra-regular">ways. </span>The disagreement is with regard to whether this decree is applicable only when there are two Jews living in the courtyard, or even when there is only one Jew living there. 
The disagreement should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov holds</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">since a gentile is suspected of bloodshed, </span>it is unusual for a single Jew to share a courtyard with a gentile. However, it is not unusual for two or more Jews to do so, as they will protect each other. Therefore, in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>Jews, <span class="gemarra-regular">who commonly</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> live </span>together with a gentile in the same courtyard, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">issued a decree </span>to the effect that the gentile renders it prohibited for them to carry. This would cause great inconvenience to Jews living with gentiles and would thereby motivate the Jews to distance themselves from gentiles. In this manner, the Sages sought to prevent the Jews from learning from the gentiles’ ways. However, in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span> Jew, for whom <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not common </span>to live together with a gentile in the same courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not issue a decree </span>that the gentile renders it prohibited for him to carry, as the Sages do not issue decrees for uncommon situations.
On the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes it happens that </span>a single Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">lives </span>together with a gentile in the same courtyard, and hence it is appropriate to issue the decree in such a case as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, the Sages said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: An </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not effective in a place </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentile </span>is living, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor is the renunciation of rights </span>to a courtyard in favor of the other residents <span class="gemarra-regular">effective </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in a place </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile </span>is living. Therefore, carrying is prohibited in a courtyard in which a gentile resides, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">rents </span>out his property to one of the Jews for the purpose of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> regardless of the number of Jews living there. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be willing <span class="gemarra-regular">to rent </span>out his property for this purpose, the living conditions will become too strained, prompting the Jew to move. 
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that a gentile will not rent out his property for the purpose of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">thinks </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps they will </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">come to take possession of his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>based on this rental, <span class="gemarra-regular">this works out well according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we require a full-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">fledged rental, </span>i.e., that rental for the purpose of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> must be proper and valid according to all the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of renting. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to the one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a flawed, </span>symbolic <span class="gemarra-regular">rental</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., all that is needed is a token gesture that has the appearance of renting, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say? </span>The gentile would understand that it is not a real rental, and therefore he would not be wary of renting out his residence. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disputed this issue as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said </span>that we require a <span class="gemarra-regular">full-fledged rental, and Rav Sheshet </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: A flawed, </span>symbolic <span class="gemarra-regular">rental </span>is sufficient.
Having mentioned this dispute, the Gemara now clarifies its particulars: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">flawed </span>rental, and <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">full-fledged </span>one? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that a <span class="gemarra-regular">full-fledged </span>rental refers to a case where one gives another person <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span> as rent, whereas in a <span class="gemarra-regular">flawed </span>rental he provides him with <span class="gemarra-regular">less than the value of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>this poses a difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">Is there anyone who said </span>that renting <span class="gemarra-regular">from a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentile for less than the value of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>valid? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Ya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’akov bar Giyorei, send in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: You should know that one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">rent from a gentile</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even for less than the value of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Ḥiyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A Noahide, </span>i.e., a gentile who stole <span class="gemarra-regular">is executed </span>for his crime, according to the laws applying to Noahides, even if he stole <span class="gemarra-regular">less than the value of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> A Noahide is particular about his property and unwilling to waive his rights to it, even if it is of minimal value; therefore, the prohibition against stealing applies to items of any value whatsoever. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in the case of Noahides, the stolen item <span class="gemarra-regular">is not returnable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the possibility of rectification by returning a stolen object was granted only to Jews. The principle that less than the value of a <span class="it-text">peruta</span> is not considered money applies to Jews alone. With regard to gentiles, it has monetary value, and therefore one may rent from a gentile with this amount. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the distinction between a full-fledged rental and a flawed rental should be explained as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> full-fledged </span>rental refers <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>one that is confirmed <span class="gemarra-regular">by legal documents</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">moharkei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>and guaranteed by<span class="gemarra-regular"> officials [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aburganei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> flawed </span>rental means one that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>confirmed <span class="gemarra-regular">by legal documents and</span> guaranteed by<span class="gemarra-regular"> officials, </span>an agreement that is unenforceable in court. Based on this explanation, the Gemara reiterates what was stated earlier with regard to the gentile’s concern about renting: <span class="gemarra-regular">This</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> works out well according to the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we require a full-fledged rental, </span>as it is clear why the gentile would refuse to rent out his property. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a flawed rental, what is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there to say </span>in this regard? Why shouldn’t the gentile want to rent out his residence? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even so, the gentile is concerned </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">witchcraft</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., that the procedure is used to cast a spell on him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not rent out </span>his residence.
The Gemara examines the ruling in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> cited in the previous discussion. Returning to <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter itself: The courtyard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a gentile is like the pen of an animal, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and it is permitted to carry in and carry out </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from the courtyard to the houses and from the houses </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the courtyard, </span>as the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span> do not apply to the residences of gentiles.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But if there is one Jew </span>living <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>in the same courtyard as the gentile, the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">renders it prohibited </span>for the Jew to carry from his house to the courtyard or vice versa. The Jew may carry there only if he rents the gentile’s property for the duration of Shabbat. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Meir.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Actually, </span>the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">does not render it prohibited </span>for the Jew to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">unless there are two Jews </span>living in the same courtyard who themselves would <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibit one another </span>from carrying if there were no <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, and the presence of the gentile renders the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> ineffective. 

Daf 62b

The Gemara proceeds to analyze the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>above: <span class="gemarra-regular">The courtyard of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentile is like the pen of an animal, </span>which implies that the residence of a gentile is not considered a significant residence. <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>otherwise in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who resides with a gentile in </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard this </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibits him </span>from carrying? This implies that a gentile’s residence is in fact of significance.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the mishna is referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">is present</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and therefore carrying is prohibited, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> refers to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where he is not present</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and therefore carrying is permitted.
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">What does </span>Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">hold</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? If he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a residence without </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">owners is</span> still <span class="gemarra-regular">considered a residence, </span>and it is prohibited to carry in the courtyard even when the owner is away, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even a gentile </span>in absentia <span class="gemarra-regular">should likewise render it prohibited</span> for carrying. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a residence </span><span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">owners is not considered a residence, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew </span>who is away <span class="gemarra-regular">should also not render it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for carrying. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a residence without </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">owners is not considered a residence, but </span>nevertheless, he draws a distinction between a Jew and a gentile. In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew, who renders it prohibited </span>to carry for those who dwell in the same courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">present </span>in his residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages decreed with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him </span>that even <span class="gemarra-regular">when he is not present, </span>his residence renders it prohibited for them to carry as though he were present.
However, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentile, </span>who even <span class="gemarra-regular">when he is present </span>does not fundamentally render it prohibited to carry, but only due to <span class="gemarra-regular">a rabbinic decree </span>that was issued <span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span>the Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the gentile’s <span class="gemarra-regular">ways, </span>no further decree was necessary. Thus, <span class="gemarra-regular">when he is present, </span>the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">renders it prohibited </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>carry; but <span class="gemarra-regular">when he is not present, he does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not render it prohibited to </span>carry. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when </span>the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">is not present, does he </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> render it prohibited </span>for carrying? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn </span>elsewhere in a mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who left </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his house </span>without establishing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and went to spend </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat in a different town, whether </span>he was <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or a Jew, he renders it prohibited </span>for the other residents of his courtyard to carry objects from their houses to the courtyard and vice versa. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Meir. </span>This indicates that according to Rabbi Meir, a gentile renders it prohibited to carry in the courtyard even if he is not present.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>it is referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the person who left his house without establishing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> intends to <span class="gemarra-regular">return on that </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">day, </span>on Shabbat. Since upon his return he will render it prohibited for others to carry in the courtyard, the decree is applied even before he returns home. However, if he left his house intending to return after the conclusion of Shabbat, he does not render it prohibited to carry, in abstentia.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> in this dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov. And Rav Huna said: </span>This is not an established <span class="it-text">halakha</span> to be issued publicly; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">the custom is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, </span>i.e., a Sage would rule according to his opinion for those who come to ask. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The people are accustomed </span>to conduct themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Ya’akov. </span>Accordingly, a Sage would not issue such a ruling even to those who inquire, but if someone acts leniently in accordance with his opinion, he would not object.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav Yosef, </span>his teacher: <span class="gemarra-regular">We</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> maintain </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the teaching of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov</span> measures <span class="gemarra-regular">a kav, but is clean</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning that it is small in quantity but clear and complete, and that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with his opinion in all instances. Moreover, with regard to our issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, </span>and therefore there is no doubt about the matter.
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to whether a disciple <span class="gemarra-regular">may issue a ruling </span>according to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov <span class="gemarra-regular">in his teacher’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> place </span>of jurisdiction, i.e., in a place where he is the recognized authority? Although it is usually prohibited to do so, perhaps such an evident and well-known principle such as this does not fall into the category of rulings that a disciple may not issue in his teacher’s territory. 
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda was asked</span> about the permissibility of cooking <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg in </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kutaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a dairy dish, <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout the years of Rav Huna’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s </span>life, <span class="gemarra-regular">he refused to issue a ruling. </span>Rav Ḥisda was a disciple of Rav Huna, and a disciple may not issue a ruling in his teacher’s place of jurisdiction about even the simplest of matters. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov bar Abba said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Abaye: </span>With regard to matters <span class="gemarra-regular">such as </span>those detailed in <span class="gemarra-italic">Megillat Ta’anit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">written and laid</span> on the shelf for all to access and offers a list of the days on which fasting is prohibited, <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning whether or not a disciple <span class="gemarra-regular">may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rule </span>about these matters <span class="gemarra-regular">in his teacher’s place </span>of jurisdiction? Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Rav Yosef said as follows</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Even </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda was asked about </span>the permissibility of cooking <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg in </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kutaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> throughout the years of Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Huna’s </span>life, <span class="gemarra-regular">he refused to issue a ruling</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥisda </span>nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">issued </span>halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">rulings in </span>the town of <span class="gemarra-regular">Kafri </span><span class="gemarra-regular">during the years of Rav Huna’s </span>life, as he was not actually in his teacher’s place. 

Daf 63a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna issued </span>halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">rulings in </span>the town of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥarta </span><span class="gemarra-regular">De’argez during the years of Rav Ḥisda’s </span>life, even though Rav Ḥisda was his teacher.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina</span> once <span class="gemarra-regular">examined </span>a slaughterer’s <span class="gemarra-regular">knife in Babylonia </span>to check if it was fit for slaughtering, during the lifetime of his teacher, Rav Ashi, who also lived in Babylonia. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said to him: What is the reason </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">Master acted in this manner? </span>Isn’t it prohibited for a disciple to issue rulings while his teacher is still alive?
Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Didn’t Rav Hamnuna issue </span>halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">rulings in Ḥarta De</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’argez during the years of Rav Ḥisda’s </span>life, as they were not in the same town, even though they were both located in Babylonia? Since I do not live in the same town as you, it stands to reason that I would be permitted to issue rulings as well. Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Ravina: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>that Rav Hamnuna <span class="gemarra-regular">did not issue </span>halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">rulings </span>during Rav Ḥisda’s lifetime, and that is the correct tradition. 
Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Ashi: In fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>that Rav Hamnuna <span class="gemarra-regular">issued rulings, and it was </span>also stated that he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not issue rulings, </span>and both traditions are correct. <span class="gemarra-regular">During the years of </span>the life of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, </span>Rav Hamnuna’s principal <span class="gemarra-regular">teacher, </span>Rav Hamnuna <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not issue rulings </span>at all, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he did issue rulings </span><span class="gemarra-regular">during the years of Rav Ḥisda’s </span>life, <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>Rav Hamnuna <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>Rav Ḥisda’s <span class="gemarra-regular">disciple</span>-<span class="gemarra-regular">colleague</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">I, too, am the Master’s disciple and colleague, </span>I should also be permitted to examine a slaughterer’s knife when I am not in the same town. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: A Torah scholar may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">examine </span>a knife <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself </span>and use it for slaughtering, without having to show it to the local Sage. The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina happened </span>to come <span class="gemarra-regular">to Meḥoza, </span>the home town of Rava. <span class="gemarra-regular">His host brought </span>out <span class="gemarra-regular">a knife </span>for slaughtering <span class="gemarra-regular">and showed </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to him. He said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: Go, bring it to Rava, </span>the town Sage, for examination. 
The host <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t the Master hold </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: A Torah scholar may examine </span>a slaughtering knife <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself? </span>In this case I am using the knife to slaughter on your behalf. Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Since <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>am only <span class="gemarra-regular">buying </span>the meat <span class="gemarra-regular">from you, </span>it is not considered as though I am slaughtering for myself. Rava’s principle does not apply to such a case. 
The Gemara cites a mnemonic for the names of the Sages mentioned in the following discussion: <span class="gemarra-italic">Zila</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">Lehanya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Rabbi Elazar from Hagronya; <span class="gemarra-italic">Maḥlif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Rav Abba bar Taḥalifa; <span class="gemarra-italic">Ika</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Rav Aḥa bar Ika; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Ya’akov</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov. 
The Gemara now relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar from Hagronya and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Abba bar Taḥalifa happened </span>to come <span class="gemarra-regular">to the house</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, in the place</span> of jurisdiction <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov. Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, wanted to prepare for them </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a third-born calf, </span>whose meat was considered a delicacy. <span class="gemarra-regular">He brought </span>out a slaughtering <span class="gemarra-regular">knife and showed </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Abba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Taḥalifa said to them: Should we not be concerned </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the respect of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Elder, </span>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov, and present the knife to him for inspection, as this is his town? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar from Hagronya said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them: </span>That is unnecessary, since <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said as follows: A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah scholar may examine </span>a knife <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself. Rabbi Elazar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from Hagronya </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">inspected </span>the knife, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he was </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">punished </span>at the hand of Heaven for disregarding the honor of the senior rabbi.
The Gemara expresses surprise: What was Rabbi Elazar from Hagronya’s mistake? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rava say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">A Torah scholar may examine </span>a slaughtering knife <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was different there, as they had </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">begun </span>to discuss the issue <span class="gemarra-regular">of the honor </span>of Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov. Had the name of Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov never arisen, they would have been permitted to examine the knife themselves. Once his name had been mentioned, however, they should have approached him with the knife. Their failure to do so is considered a display of disrespect. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ya’akov is different, as he was illustrious </span>in age and wisdom, and thus deserved more honor than a regular Sage.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>Even though it is ordinarily prohibited for a disciple to issue a halakhic ruling in his teacher’s place, if he does so <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to separate </span>another person <span class="gemarra-regular">from a prohibitio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> he is committing, <span class="gemarra-regular">even in </span>his teacher’s <span class="gemarra-regular">presence it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seems well, </span>i.e., it is permitted. The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina was </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">sitting before Rav Ashi </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> saw a certain man tying his donkey to a palm</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tree on Shabbat, </span>in violation of the decree of the Sages against utilizing trees on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">He raised his voice</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him </span>in protest, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the man <span class="gemarra-regular">paid him no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> attention. </span>Ravina then <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Ashi: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let this man</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be in excommunication </span>for transgressing the words of the Sages and ignoring a scholar’s rebuke. 
Afterward, Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Ashi: Behavior <span class="gemarra-regular">such </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as this, </span>the way I acted in your presence just now, <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">appear like irreverent </span>behavior? Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: </span>With regard to this it is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“There</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is no wisdom or understanding or council against the Lord</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Proverbs 21:30). The Sages expounded this verse as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wherever a desecration of </span>God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">name is involved, no </span><span class="gemarra-regular">respect is paid </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">to a teacher, </span>i.e., in such a situation one should disregard the respect due to his teacher’s wisdom and understanding and object to the inappropriate behavior.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>With regard to one who issues a halakhic ruling in his teacher’s location without the intention of preventing someone from violating a prohibition, the following distinction applies: <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span>the teacher’s actual <span class="gemarra-regular">presence, </span>the disciple <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited </span>to issue such a ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>if he does so, he <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>to receive the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>penalty at the hand of Heaven. However, when he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his </span>actual <span class="gemarra-regular">presence, </span>the disciple <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to issue the ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he is not liable </span>to receive the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>penalty.
The Gemara asks: Is the disciple <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable to receive the death penalty if he issues his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">not in </span>the teacher’s <span class="gemarra-regular">presence? But wasn’t </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>otherwise in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: The sons of Aaron </span><span class="gemarra-regular">die</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only because they issued a halakhic ruling before Moses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, their teacher? What did they expoun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in support of their conclusion that they must bring fire inside as opposed to waiting for fire to come down from the heavens? It is stated in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the sons of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar, </span>and lay the wood in order on the fire” (Leviticus 1:7), which led <span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Although fire descends from Heaven</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzva to bring ordinary </span>fire. Although they derived this from the verses, they were punished for ruling in the presence of their teacher. 
It was further related that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer had a certain disciple who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> issued a </span>halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">ruling in his presence. Rabbi Eliezer said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to his wife, Imma Shalom: I will be surprised if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this one completes his year, </span>i.e., if he lives until the end of the year. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>so it was, <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not complete his year.</span>
His wife <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Are you a prophet? </span>He <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> her: I am not a prophet, nor the son of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a prophet, but I have received the following </span>tradition: <span class="gemarra-regular">Anyone</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who issues a halakhic ruling in his teacher’s presence</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is liable </span>to receive the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>penalty.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabba bar bar Ḥana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: That</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disciple was named Yehuda ben Gurya, and he was three</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> parasangs away from </span>Rabbi Eliezer. Apparently, one is liable for the death penalty even if he did not issue his ruling in his teacher’s presence.
The Gemara answers: In fact, the incident <span class="gemarra-regular">took place in </span>the actual <span class="gemarra-regular">presence </span>of the teacher, which is why the disciple was punished. The distance mentioned refers to the distance between the student’s usual place and the teacher. The Gemara expresses surprise: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t </span>Rabba bar bar Ḥana <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that he was three parasangs away from </span>his teacher? That implies that this was his distance from his teacher at the time of the ruling. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">And, according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to your reasoning, </span>that the details of the story must relate to the time of the ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>mention <span class="gemarra-regular">his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> name and his father’s name? Rather, </span>the details were given so <span class="gemarra-regular">that you should not say it was a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> parable. </span>That is also the reason why he provided the details concerning the student’s usual place. This does not contradict the fact that Yehuda ben Gurya issued his ruling in the actual presence of his teacher.
The Gemara continues to discuss the same topic. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan said: Whoever issues a halakhic ruling in his teacher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s presence is deserving of being bitten by a snake</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is stated: “And Elihu, son of Barachel the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Buzite answered and said, I am young, </span>and you are very old; <span class="gemarra-regular">therefore I held back </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">zaḥalti</span>] and I was afraid, and did not declare my opinion to you” (Job 32:6), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written: “With the venom </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the crawling things of </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">zoḥalei</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">the dust” </span>(Deuteronomy 32:24), which refers to snakes. Elihu’s statement is understood as follows: I must apologize for speaking in my teacher’s presence, for one who does so is liable to be punished with the bite of a snake. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ze’eiri </span>said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina said: </span>Whoever issues a halakhic ruling in his teacher’s presence <span class="gemarra-regular">is called a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sinner, as it is stated: “Your word have I hidden </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in my heart</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that I might not sin against </span><span class="gemarra-regular">You” </span>(Psalms 119:11). In what case would speaking one’s word entail a sin? In a case where one rules on a matter of <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the presence of his teacher. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna raised a contradiction </span>between the verse previously mentioned and another verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is written: “Your word have I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hidden in my heart,” </span>implying that David did not want to reveal the words of Torah, whereas in a second verse <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “I have preached righteousness in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the great congregation” </span>(Psalms 40:10). He answered: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>in the verse in which David remained silent, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the period when Ira HaYa’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">iri, </span>David’s teacher, <span class="gemarra-regular">was alive; there, </span>in the verse where he publicized his words, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">period when Ira HaYa’iri was no </span>longer <span class="gemarra-regular">alive.</span>
Having mentioned Ira HaYa’iri, the Gemara now cites a related teaching. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abba bar Zavda said: Whoever gives </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>priestly <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to one pries</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> has acted improperly and <span class="gemarra-regular">brings famine </span><span class="gemarra-regular">into the world </span>as punishment. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: </span>“And also <span class="gemarra-regular">Ira HaYa’iri was a priest for David” </span>(II Samuel 20:26), which invites the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Was he a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">priest for David </span>alone, and <span class="gemarra-regular">not for anyone else? Rather, </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>David <span class="gemarra-regular">would send </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>priestly <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him </span>alone, i.e., he was the only priest to enjoy David’s gifts. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written afterward:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “And there was a famine in the days of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">David, </span>three years, year after year” (II Samuel 21:1).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>Anyone who rules in his teacher’s presence <span class="gemarra-regular">is lowered from his </span>position of <span class="gemarra-regular">greatness</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is stated: “And Elazar the priest said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the men of war </span>who went to battle: This is the statute of the Torah which the Lord commanded Moses” (Numbers 31:21). <span class="gemarra-regular">Although </span>Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the soldiers: God commanded this statute <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father’s brother, while to me</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He did not command </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">even so he was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">punished </span>for speaking in this manner in the presence of his teacher, Moses. 
What was his punishment? <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written </span>that God had told Moses with regard to Joshua: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall stand before Elazar the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">priest, </span>who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before the Lord: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation” (Numbers 27:21). Elazar was originally awarded a place of great honor. <span class="gemarra-regular">But we do not find </span>in the Bible <span class="gemarra-regular">that Joshua </span>ever <span class="gemarra-regular">had need of him. </span>It is never stated that Joshua made use of the Urim through Elazar, which shows that Elazar never achieved the greatness promised him. 
With regard to this same issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Levi said: Whoever answers a word in the presence</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of his teacher will go down to the netherworld childless</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is stated: “And Joshua bin Nun, the minister</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Moses from his youth, answered and said: My lord</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Moses, shut them in” </span>(Numbers 11:28). Since he spoke to his teacher out of turn, he was punished by remaining childless. 

Daf 63b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written </span>at the end of the list of the descendants of Ephraim: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Non</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his son, Joshua his son” </span>(i Chronicles 7:27), which implies that Joshua himself had no children.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>tradition <span class="gemarra-regular">differs from </span>the following statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba bar Pappa, for Rabbi Abba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Pappa said: Joshua was punished </span>to remain childless <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">because he had prevented the Jewish people from </span>fulfilling the commandment of <span class="gemarra-regular">being fruitful and multiplying for one night. </span>Therefore, he was punished measure-for-measure by not having children himself. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: “And it came to pass when</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Joshua was by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and looked, </span>and, behold, a man stood over against him with his sword drawn in his hand” (Joshua 5:13), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written </span>further: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he said: No, but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I am captain of the host of the Lord, I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> am now come” </span>(Joshua 5:14). The man, an angel, came to demand something of Joshua and to rebuke him. 
The angel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Last night,</span> due to your preparations for war, <span class="gemarra-regular">you neglected the daily</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> evening offering, and now, </span>tonight, <span class="gemarra-regular">you are neglecting Torah study</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Joshua asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">For which of </span>these sins <span class="gemarra-regular">have you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> come </span>specially to reprove me? He <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: “I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> am now come,” </span>i.e., the fact that I did not come last night, but waited until now, shows that the sin of neglecting Torah study is the more severe one.
Joshua <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately </span>acted to rectify the matter by deciding that he must devote more time to learning Torah, as it is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And Joshua walked that night in the midst of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">valley [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ha’emek</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Joshua 8:13). <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that he walked </span>all night <span class="gemarra-regular">in the depth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">be’omeka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>thereby atoning for his previous neglect of Torah study. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they learned </span>as a tradition that <span class="gemarra-regular">any time that the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ark and the Divine Presence are not resting in their</span> proper <span class="gemarra-regular">places, </span>the entire Jewish people <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited </span>from engaging <span class="gemarra-regular">in marital relations. </span>Owing to the nation’s preoccupation with war, the Ark was not restored to its rightful place in the Tabernacle. Since Joshua did not attend to this state of affairs, he was responsible for the people’s neglect of the commandment to be fruitful and multiply, for which he was punished by remaining childless. 
The Gemara now cites a further teaching in this regard: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Inya said in the name of Rav: Torah study is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> greater than the offering of daily </span>sacrifices, as the angel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Joshua: <span class="gemarra-regular">“I am now come,” </span>i.e., on account of the second sin, demonstrating that neglect of Torah study is a more serious offense than neglect of the daily offerings.
With regard to the neglect of the commandment of procreation, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beruna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: Whoever sleeps</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a chamber in which a husband and wife are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> resting, </span>thus thwarting their intimacy, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse says about him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “The women of my people you cast out from their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pleasant houses” </span>(Micah 2:9), and his punishment is detailed in that chapter.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yosef said: </span>This applies not only to a woman who is ritually pure and permitted to her husband, but <span class="gemarra-regular">even in </span>the case of a man <span class="gemarra-regular">whose wife is menstruating</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> for even then, although she is prohibited to him, they are more comfortable being alone together.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: If his wife is menstruating, may a blessing come </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upon </span>the person sleeping in the room, for he protects the couple from the possibility of sin. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">But that is not so, </span>i.e., this argument is invalid, <span class="gemarra-regular">for who protected </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">until now? </span>In other words, there is no need for concern in this case, and hence one must refrain from behavior that causes distress to the couple.
The Gemara returns to the issue of renting out domains for the purpose of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">there was a certain alleyway in which </span>the gentile, <span class="gemarra-regular">Laḥman bar Ristak, lived. </span>His Jewish neighbors <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: Rent us your domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., your right to use the alleyway, so that it will not render it prohibited for us to carry. <span class="gemarra-regular">He would not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rent </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to them, </span>and therefore they could not carry in the alleyway on Shabbat. 
The Jewish neighbors <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">spoke to Abaye, </span>asking him how they might proceed. He <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Go, </span>all of you, and <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce your domains, </span>i.e., your rights to use the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of one </span>person, who will be permitted to carry in it. In this manner <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one individual </span>living <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">place as a gentile. And </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> has already been established that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one individual </span>living <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">place as a gentile, </span>the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not render it prohibited </span>for him to carry. Consequently, one person at least will be able to make use of the alleyway. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: But isn’t the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reason </span>that no restrictions are imposed when one person lives together with a gentile in the same courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">only that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is not common for </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">to live </span>with a gentile in that fashion? <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>many people <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">living </span>in the same alleyway as the gentile. In this more common situation, the Sages did impose restrictions. 
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Any renunciation of the domains </span>of many people <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of a </span>single <span class="gemarra-regular">individual is an uncommon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">occurrence. </span>The principle is that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">uncommon occurrence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Sages did not issue a decree </span>as a preventive measure. In pressing circumstances such as the se, one may rely on this allowance. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yehoshua, went </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">reported this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Rava, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>

Daf 64a

<span class="gemarra-regular">If so, you have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> abolished </span>the halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">category of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from that alleyway. </span>Since from a halakhic perspective it is considered as though only one person lives in that alleyway, there is no need for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. Consequently, when the residents carry in it without an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, observers will mistakenly think that it is permitted to carry in an alleyway even without an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, replied: It is required <span class="gemarra-regular">that they establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> anyway, as a reminder of the laws of <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span>, even though it serves no halakhic purpose. Rava retorted that this in turn results in a different problem: Observers will then <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">effective </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">in the place of a gentile, </span>even if he does not rent out his domain, which is against the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. He replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">We make an announcement </span>to the effect that they are not carrying because of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, and that it only serves as a reminder.
Rava rejected this option as well: Can we make <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">announcement for the children? </span>Even if it is assured that all adults present will hear the announcement, how will the children, who do not hear or understand the announcement, know the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> later in life? Recalling that their fathers established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in this alleyway, they will think that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is effective even in the place of a gentile. Therefore, one cannot rely on Abaye’s solution.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Rava said </span>that the gentile’s Jewish neighbors should proceed as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let one of them go and become friendly</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the gentile, <span class="gemarra-regular">and ask him </span>for permission to make use of <span class="gemarra-regular">a place </span>in his domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and set </span><span class="gemarra-regular">something down there, thus becoming like </span>the gentile’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hired </span><span class="gemarra-regular">laborer or harvester. And Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Not only can the gentile himself rent out his domain for the purpose of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, but <span class="gemarra-regular">even his hired</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> laborer, and even his harvester</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if he is a Jew, <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span>rent out the space and <span class="gemarra-regular">contribute to the</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> on his behalf, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this is enough</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav Yosef: If there were five</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hired laborers or five harvesters there, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Does the presence of more than one of these, if they are all Jews, entail a stringency, such that they are all required to join in the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> or that they are all required to rent out his domain? Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the gentile’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hired laborer or harvester </span>stands in his place <span class="gemarra-regular">as a leniency, would they say that his hired laborer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or harvester </span>stands in his place <span class="gemarra-regular">as a stringency? </span>This law was stated only as a leniency with regard to the laws of renting for the purpose of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, not in order to introduce more stringencies.
The Gemara proceeds to examine the ruling cited in the course of the previous discussion. Returning to <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter itself, Rav Yehuda said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: Even </span>the gentile’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hired laborer, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even his harvester, may contribute to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> in his stead, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this is enough. Rav Naḥman said: How </span><span class="gemarra-regular">excellent is this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Even Rav Naḥman agreed with this statement, and viewed it as correct and substantiated. 
However, Rav Naḥman did not give his approval to all of Rav Yehuda’s rulings, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: If one drank a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">log</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of wine, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not issue a </span>halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">ruling</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the wine is liable to confuse his thinking. With regard to this second statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: This </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> excellent, as </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">myself, as long as I have not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> drunk a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">log</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of wine, my mind is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clear. </span>It is only after drinking wine that I can issue appropriate rulings.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to </span>Rav Naḥman: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master said this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>making a statement that praises one <span class="it-text">halakha</span> and disparages another? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina say: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “But he who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">keeps company with prostitutes </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">zonot</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">wastes his fortune” </span>(Proverbs 29:3)? It alludes to the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">Anyone who says: This </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teaching is pleasant </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">zo na’a</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">but this is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not pleasant, loses the fortune of Torah. </span>It is not in keeping with the honor of Torah to make such evaluations. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I retract, </span>and I will no longer make such comments concerning words of Torah.
On the topic of drinking wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna said: One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who has drunk </span>wine <span class="gemarra-regular">must not pray, but if he </span>nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">prayed, his prayer is a prayer, </span>i.e., he has fulfilled his obligation. On the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is intoxicated </span>with wine <span class="gemarra-regular">must not pray, and if he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prayed, his prayer is an abomination</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances </span>in which a person is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">one who has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">drunk </span>wine; <span class="gemarra-regular">and what are the circumstances </span>in which a person is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is intoxicated </span>with wine? The Gemara answers that one can learn this from <span class="gemarra-regular">the following </span>event: <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Abba bar Shumni and Rav Menashya bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yirmeya from Gifti were taking leave of each other at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the ford of the Yofti River, they said: Let each </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one of us say something that his fellow </span>scholar <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">heard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for Mari bar Rav Huna said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">A person must take leave of his fellow only in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the midst of </span>a discussion of <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as due to this he will remember him. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">opened </span>the discussion <span class="gemarra-regular">and said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>where a person is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who has drunk </span>wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what are the circumstances </span>where a person is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is intoxicated </span>with wine? <span class="gemarra-regular">One who has drunk </span>wine refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone </span>who has drunk wine but whose mind remains clear enough <span class="gemarra-regular">that he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is able to talk in the presence of a king. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One who is intoxicated </span>refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone </span>who is so disoriented by the wine he has drunk <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not able to talk in the presence of a king. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The other one </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">opened </span>a different discussion <span class="gemarra-regular">and said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who took possession</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a convert’s property, what should he do so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that it remain in his hands</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The property of a convert who died without children is regarded as ownerless, and is acquired by the first person to perform a valid act of acquisition upon it. Since in this case the one who took possession of the property did not acquire it through his own labor, his ownership is tenuous, and he is liable to lose it unless he uses it for the purpose of a mitzva. One in this situation <span class="gemarra-regular">should buy a Torah scroll with </span>part of the revenue, and by the merit of this act, he will retain the rest. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: Even </span>

Daf 64b

<span class="gemarra-regular">a husband </span>who acquired rights <span class="gemarra-regular">to his wife’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>that she had brought into the marriage as her dowry should use part of the profits for the acquisition of a Torah scroll. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Even if he entered into a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">business venture and made a </span>large <span class="gemarra-regular">profit, </span>he should act in a similar manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Even if he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">found a lost article, </span>he should do the same. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>He need not use the money to commission the writing of a Torah scroll, as <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote </span>a set of <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries with it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> this, too, is a mitzva whose merit will enable him to retain the rest of the money.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥanin said, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥanina </span>who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the verse </span>that alludes to this? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “And Israel vowed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a vow </span>to the Lord and said: If You will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will consecrate their cities” (Numbers 21:2), which shows that one who wishes to succeed should sanctify a portion of his earnings for Heaven.
The Gemara now cites additional teachings relating to the drinking of wine. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Abba said: </span>Walking a <span class="gemarra-regular">path of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">sleeping </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">a minimal amount, </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">dispel the </span>effect of <span class="gemarra-regular">wine </span>that one has drunk. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: They only taught </span>this with regard to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has drunk a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">log</span> of wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who has drunk more than a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">log</span>, this advice is not useful. In that case, walking a <span class="gemarra-regular">path </span>of such a distance <span class="gemarra-regular">will preoccupy </span>and exhaust <span class="gemarra-regular">him all the more, and </span>a small amount <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sleep will </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">intoxicate </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him.</span>
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does </span>walking <span class="gemarra-regular">a path of </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mil</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dispel the </span>effects of <span class="gemarra-regular">wine? Wasn’t </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">There was an incident involving </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel, who was riding a donkey and traveling from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Akko to Keziv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>his student <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elai was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">walking behind him. </span>Rabban Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">fine loaves </span>of bread <span class="gemarra-regular">on the road, and he said to </span>his student: <span class="gemarra-regular">Elai, take the loaves from the road. </span>Further along the way, Rabban Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">encountered a certain gentile </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: Mavgai, take these loaves from Elai.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Elai joined </span>the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">and said to him: Where are you from? </span>He <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: From the </span>nearby <span class="gemarra-regular">towns of guardsmen. </span>He asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is your name? </span>The gentile replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">My name</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is Mavgai. </span>He then inquired: <span class="gemarra-regular">Has Rabban Gamliel ever met</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you before, </span>seeing as he knows your name? He <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: No.</span>
The Gemara interrupts the story in order to comment: <span class="gemarra-regular">At that time we learned that Rabban Gamliel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> divined </span>the gentile’s name <span class="gemarra-regular">by way of divine inspiration</span> that rested upon him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And at that time we </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">learned three matters </span>of <span class="it-text">halakha</span> from Rabban Gamliel’s behavior: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned that one may not pass by food, </span>i.e., if a person sees food lying on the ground, he must stop and pick it up. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">learned that we follow the majority of travelers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Since the area was populated mostly by gentiles, Rabban Gamliel assumed that the loaf belonged to a gentile, and was consequently prohibited to be eaten by a Jew. Therefore, he ordered that it be given to a gentile. And <span class="gemarra-regular">we</span> further <span class="gemarra-regular">learned that </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened bread belonging to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a gentile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is permitted </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">benefi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> from this food <span class="gemarra-regular">after Passover.</span> The incident recounted above occurred not long after the festival of Passover. By giving the loaf to the gentile instead of burning it in accordance with the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of leavened bread that remains after Passover, Rabban Gamliel gained a certain benefit from it in the form of the gentile’s gratitude. This benefit is regarded as having monetary value.
The Gemara resumes the narrative: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Rabban Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">arrived in Keziv, a </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>before him <span class="gemarra-regular">to request </span>that he dissolve <span class="gemarra-regular">his vow. </span>Rabban Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who was with him, </span>i.e., Rabbi Elai: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did we drink a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">log</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of Italian wine </span>earlier? He <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Yes. </span>Rabban Gamliel replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so, let him journey after us until </span>the effect of <span class="gemarra-regular">our wine is dispelled, </span>after which we may consider his issue. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>that person <span class="gemarra-regular">journeyed after them </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">three</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">mil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, until </span>Rabban Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">arrived at the Ladder of Tyre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. When he arrived at the Ladder of Tyre, Rabban Gamliel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> alighted from his donkey and wrapped himself </span>in his shawl in the customary manner of a judge, who wraps himself in a shawl in order to sit in awe at the time of judgment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he sat and dissolved his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> vow. </span>
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">At</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that time we learned many matters </span>of <span class="it-text">halakha</span> from Rabban Gamliel’s conduct. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned that a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">log</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Italian wine intoxicates, and we learned </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> intoxicated may not issue a </span>halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">ruling, and we learned</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>walking on <span class="gemarra-regular">a path dispels </span>the effect <span class="gemarra-regular">of wine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>lastly <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned that one may not annul vows</span> when he is <span class="gemarra-regular">either mounted </span>on an animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">or walking</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, or </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">standing, but </span>only when he is <span class="gemarra-regular">sitting.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">In any event, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching</span> that Rabban Gamliel found it necessary to walk <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mil</span> in order to become sober after drinking wine. The Gemara resolves the contradiction. <span class="gemarra-regular">Italian wine is different </span>in that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is more intoxicating, </span>therefore more extended activity is required in order to dispel its effects.
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥman say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh said: They taught </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who has drunk a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">log</span> of wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">drunk more than a quarter-</span><span class="it-text">log</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">walking </span>that distance <span class="gemarra-regular">will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">preoccupy </span>and exhaust <span class="gemarra-regular">him all the more, and </span>a small amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">sleep will </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">intoxicate him? </span>If Italian wine is more intoxicating than other wine, shouldn’t a quarter-<span class="it-text">log</span> be considered like a larger quantity of other wine? 
The Gemara answers: Being <span class="gemarra-regular">mounted </span>on an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">is different </span>from walking; since he is not on foot it is not such a tiring activity. Accordingly, riding three <span class="it-text">mil</span> will not exhaust him; rather, it will dispel the effect of the wine. The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now that you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have arrived at this </span>conclusion, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rami bar Abba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who says that walking one <span class="it-text">mil</span> is sufficient, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also not difficult, </span>as he too can say that <span class="gemarra-regular">riding</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is different </span>from walking. Since one is not on foot, the effects of the wine are not dispelled as quickly. Therefore, three <span class="it-text">mil</span> is necessary. 
The Gemara poses a question with regard to one of the details of the story: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so, </span>that Rabban Gamliel was required to alight from his donkey in order to annul the vow? <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> didn’t Rav Naḥman say: One may annul vows walking</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, standing, or mounted? </span>Why, then, did Rabban Gamliel dismount his donkey? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>an authority <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">open </span>the possibility for dissolution of a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regret </span>alone. In other words, there is no need to search for a special reason in order to dissolve a person’s vow; it is enough to ascertain that he regrets making it. This can be done easily, even while walking, standing, or riding. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>another authority <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not open </span>the possibility for dissolution of a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regret </span>alone. Rather, one must find an opening, i.e., a particular reason to dissolve the vow in question, which requires a thorough analysis of the circumstances of the vow. This task must be performed free of distractions, which means one must be seated (<span class="it-text">Tosafot</span>).
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabba bar bar Ḥana</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>With <span class="gemarra-regular">what did Rabban Gamliel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> open </span>the possibility for dissolving his vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for that man</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., what opening did he find for him? Rabban Gamliel cited the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“There is one who utters</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like the piercings of a sword; but the tongue of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the wise is health” </span>(Proverbs 12:18) and explained it as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whoever utters </span>a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">deserves to be pierce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by a sword, </span>as he might fail to fulfill it. Therefore, one should not vow at all. Had you known that whoever vows is liable to be executed, would you have vowed? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, it is the tongue of the wise</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that heals, </span>as when a Sage dissolves a vow, he dissolves it retroactively, and it is as though one had never taken the vow.
The Gemara continues with its analysis of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>previously: One of the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> learned from the incident involving Rabban Gamliel was that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not pass by food; </span>rather, one must treat the food with respect and pick it up. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Yoḥai: They taught </span>this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">only in the early </span><span class="gemarra-regular">generations, when Jewish women were not accustomed to using witchcraft. However, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the later generations, when Jewish women are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accustomed to using witchcraft</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one may pass by </span>food, as a spell might have been cast on the bread, and one must not put himself in unnecessary danger. 
A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span>If the loaves are <span class="gemarra-regular">whole, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">pass </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">by, </span>as they might have been placed there for the purposes of witchcraft; however, if they are in <span class="gemarra-regular">pieces, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pass </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">by, </span>because bread in pieces is not used for witchcraft. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi said to Rav Ashi: </span>Do <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not perform </span>magic with <span class="gemarra-regular">pieces </span>of bread? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written </span>in the verse that deals with witchcraft: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you have profaned Me among My people for handfuls of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">barley and for pieces of bread” </span>(Ezekiel 13:19)? The Gemara answers: The verse does not mean that they used pieces of bread in their witchcraft, but rather that <span class="gemarra-regular">they took</span> such pieces <span class="gemarra-regular">as their wages.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said in the name of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Elazar ben Azarya: </span>

Daf 65a

<span class="gemarra-regular">I can </span>make an argument that <span class="gemarra-regular">exempts the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">entire world from judgment, from the day that the Temple </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was destroyed until now. As it is stated: “Therefore, hear </span><span class="gemarra-regular">now this, you afflicted and drunken, but not from wine” </span>(Isaiah 51:21), which teaches that in the wake of the destruction of the Temple, all Jews are considered intoxicated and are not responsible for any sins they commit. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to this argument from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to one who is <span class="gemarra-regular">intoxicated, his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> acquisition is a </span>binding <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition; </span>that is, he cannot retract the transaction when he is sober, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">his sale</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a </span>binding <span class="gemarra-regular">sale. </span>Moreover, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he committed a transgression</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for which </span>he is liable to receive the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>penalty, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is executed; </span>and if the offense is punishable by <span class="gemarra-regular">lashes, he is flogged. The principle is </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is like a sober person in all matters, except that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he is exempt from prayer. </span>Therefore, even if the people of Israel are considered drunk, they are nonetheless responsible for their actions.
The Gemara answers that even Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya did not mean that they should be exempt from liability for all their sins. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">his statement: I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> can exempt? </span>He, <span class="gemarra-regular">too, </span>meant that he could exempt them <span class="gemarra-regular">from the judgment of prayer, </span>i.e., Jews cannot be held liable for praying without the proper intentions. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina said: They taught </span>that an intoxicated person is responsible for all his actions <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not reach the </span>state of <span class="gemarra-regular">intoxication of Lot; however, if he reached the </span>state of <span class="gemarra-regular">intoxication of Lot, </span>so that he is altogether unaware of his actions, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is exempt from all </span>liability. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Whoever passes a shield </span>over himself <span class="gemarra-regular">at a time of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">arrogance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., whoever suppresses his evil inclination as though it were covered with a shield when he is arrogant, e.g., when he is intoxicated or the like (Rabbeinu Ḥananel), <span class="gemarra-regular">troubles will be closed and sealed from him, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “The channels of [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">afikei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] his scales</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are his pride, closed together as with a tight [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] seal” </span>(Job 41:7). The verse is interpreted homiletically: When at a time of arrogance a person passes a shield [<span class="it-text">mapik</span>] over his evil inclination, his troubles [<span class="it-text">tzarot</span>] will be closed and sealed before him.
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where may it be inferred that </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>word <span class="gemarra-italic">afik</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a formulation </span>denoting <span class="gemarra-regular">passing [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aborei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]?</span> The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “My brothers have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dealt deceitfully like a wadi, like the channel [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">afik</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brooks that pass by [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ya’avoru</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Job 6:15). This implies that the term <span class="it-text">afik</span> is synonymous with the verb <span class="it-text">ya’avoru</span>, which refers to something that travels and passes by.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>This is not the correct interpretation; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was stated </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">whoever does not </span>cover, but <span class="gemarra-regular">draws out [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mapik</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>a shield at a time of arrogance, troubles will be closed and sealed from him. In other words, a person must draw his weapons and shield in order to fight his evil inclination when it tries to overpower him (Rabbeinu Ḥananel). 
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where may it be inferred that this </span>word <span class="gemarra-italic">mapik</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is a formulation </span>denoting <span class="gemarra-regular">revealing? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written: “The channels of [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">afikei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] waters were seen, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the foundations of the world were laid bare” </span>(Psalms 18:16).
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, since the verses may be interpreted both in accordance with</span> the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>this<span class="gemarra-regular"> Master and in accordance with </span>the opinion of the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, what is </span>the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>with regard to the following practice of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as Rav Sheshet gave </span>the responsibility for monitoring <span class="gemarra-regular">his sleep</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to his attendant, </span>instructing the attendant to wake him when the time for prayer arrived. One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Ḥanina, <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>the opinion that the practice of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet </span>is correct, as Rabbi Ḥanina maintains that if one is in great need of sleep, it is better to nap for a while and then wake up with renewed vigor. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one Sage, </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not of </span>the opinion that the practice of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet </span>is correct. He holds that a person must marshal his strength and pray, rather than succumb to the need for sleep.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: Anyone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whose mind is unsettled should not pray, as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated: When distressed, one should not issue decisions</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina, on a day that he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was angry, </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">not pray, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">he said that it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written: When distressed, one should not issue decisions. </span>The Gemara similarly relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Ukva, on a day of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a south wind, would not venture out to the court, </span>for this hot and harsh wind would disturb his usual clarity of mind. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>The study of <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> requires clarity, as </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">a day </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">north wind </span>blows and clears the skies. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>similarly that <span class="gemarra-regular">if my stepmother says to me: Bring </span>me a dish of <span class="gemarra-italic">kutaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, I can no </span>longer <span class="gemarra-regular">study </span>Torah in my usual fashion, as even a simple task such as this troubles me and distracts me from my Torah study. 
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If I am bitten by a louse, I can no </span>longer <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>in my usual manner. The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">the mother of Mar, son of Ravina, would prepare seven </span><span class="gemarra-regular">garments for him for the seven days </span>of the week, so that he would not be bitten by the lice found in old clothes (Rabbeinu Ḥananel).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: Night was created only for sleep</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: The moon was created</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only for </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">study </span>by its light. When people <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rabbi Zeira: Your teachings are </span>exceedingly <span class="gemarra-regular">sharp, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to them: They were </span>formulated <span class="gemarra-regular">during the daytime </span>hours. This teaches that Torah study during the day is most beneficial to clarity of the mind. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda’s daughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to </span>her father, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda, </span>who would spend his nights in study: <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t the Master wish to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sleep a little? </span>He <span class="gemarra-regular">said to her: Days that are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">long </span>in quantity <span class="gemarra-regular">but short </span>in the opportunity to study Torah and perform mitzvot <span class="gemarra-regular">will soon arrive, and we will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sleep a lot. </span>After I die, there will be more than enough time for sleep. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: We, </span>Torah scholars, <span class="gemarra-regular">are day workers, </span>as our study is performed primarily during the day. The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ya’akov </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">borrow and repay</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., if for some reason he neglected to study during the day, he would use the night hours to compensate for the missed time.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: One who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">returns </span>home <span class="gemarra-regular">from a journey should not pray for three </span><span class="gemarra-regular">days </span>while recovering from the hardship of being on the road, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And I gathered them together </span><span class="gemarra-regular">at the river that runs to Aḥava, and we encamped </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there for three days, and I inspected the people” </span>(Ezra 8:15), after which it is stated: “Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Aḥava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of Him a safe journey for us” (Ezra 8:21), which teaches that they rested three days before praying.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> father, when he would return </span>home <span class="gemarra-regular">from his journey, would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not pray </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">three days, </span>as he would have to rest from his journey. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">would not pray in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a house that contained an alcoholic beverage, </span>as the scent of the alcohol would disturb his concentration during prayer. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa would not pray in a house that contained</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> small </span>fried <span class="gemarra-regular">fish, </span>due to their smell.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Whoever is appeased by his wine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., whoever becomes more relaxed after drinking, <span class="gemarra-regular">has in him </span>an element of <span class="gemarra-regular">the mind-set of his Creator, </span>who acted in a similar fashion, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Lord smelled the sweet savor, </span>and the Lord said in His heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake” (Genesis 8:21). As it were, God acted more favorably toward His creatures after He was appeased with the smell of the burnt offerings. Smell can be as potent as drinking or eating itself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Anyone who remains settled </span>of mind <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>drinking <span class="gemarra-regular">wine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and does not become intoxicated, <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>an element of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mind-set of seventy Elders. </span>The allusion is: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wine [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yayin</span> spelled <span class="it-text">yod</span>, <span class="it-text">yod</span>, <span class="it-text">nun</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">was given in seventy letters, </span>as the numerological value of the letters comprising the word is seventy, as <span class="it-text">yod</span> equals ten and <span class="it-text">nun</span> equals fifty. Similarly, the word <span class="gemarra-regular">secret [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sod</span> spelled <span class="it-text">samekh</span>, <span class="it-text">vav</span>, <span class="it-text">dalet</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> given in seventy letters, </span>as <span class="it-text">samekh</span> equals sixty, <span class="it-text">vav</span> equals six, and <span class="it-text">dalet</span> equals four. Typically, when <span class="gemarra-regular">wine entered</span> the body, <span class="gemarra-regular">a secret emerged. </span>Whoever does not reveal secrets when he drinks is clearly blessed with a firm mind, like that of seventy Elders.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanin said: Wine was created only in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> order to comfort mourners </span>in their distress, <span class="gemarra-regular">and to reward</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the wicked </span>in this world so they will have no reward left in the World-to-Come, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: “Give strong drink to him that is ready to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> perish, </span>and wine to the bitter of soul. Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more” (Proverbs 31:6). “Him that is ready to perish” refers to the wicked, who will perish from the world, while “the bitter of soul” denotes mourners.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanin bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Pappa said: Anyone in whose house wine does not flow </span><span class="gemarra-regular">like water is not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">included </span>in the Torah’s <span class="gemarra-regular">blessing, as it is stated: “And He shall bless your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bread and your water” </span>(Exodus 23:25). The water mentioned in this verse actually refers to wine, as learned in the following manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as bread </span>is something <span class="gemarra-regular">that may be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> purchased with </span>second-<span class="gemarra-regular">tithe money, </span>i.e., one is permitted to buy bread with money used to redeem second-tithe, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>too the word <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span>in the verse is referring to a liquid <span class="gemarra-regular">that may be purchased with </span>second-<span class="gemarra-regular">tithe</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> money. And what is that? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">wine, </span>as one may buy wine with second-tithe money, but one may not buy water; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>nevertheless the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">calls it “water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.” </span>

Daf 65b

This teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>wine <span class="gemarra-regular">flows in </span>a person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">house like water, there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a blessing, but if not, </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>blessing.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Elai said: In three matters a person’s </span>true character is <span class="gemarra-regular">ascertained; in his cup, </span>i.e., his behavior when he drinks; <span class="gemarra-regular">in his pocket, </span>i.e., his conduct in his financial dealings with other people; <span class="gemarra-regular">and in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his anger</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And some say: </span>A person <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>reveals his real nature <span class="gemarra-regular">in his laughter.</span>
The Gemara returns to the topic of <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>It once happened that there were two courtyards, one within the other, with <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew and a gentile </span>living in the <span class="gemarra-regular">inner </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">while </span>a single <span class="gemarra-regular">Jew </span>lived <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the outer one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The <span class="gemarra-regular">case came before Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi for a decision as to whether carrying in the outer courtyard could be permitted without renting from the gentile, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he prohibited </span>it. The case then came before <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥiyya, and he </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yosef were sitting at the end of Rav Sheshet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">lecture</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rav Sheshet sat and said: In</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">did Rav say </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">ruling of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his, </span>with regard to the residents of two courtyards? It was <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>who maintains that a gentile renders it prohibited for even a single Jew who resides with him to carry in the courtyard, and therefore it is necessary for the Jew to rent from him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba nodded his head </span>in agreement with this explanation.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: Would two great men like </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">Sages, </span>Rabba and Rav Sheshet, <span class="gemarra-regular">err in such a matter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? If </span>this ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, why do I </span>need to state that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew in the outer </span>courtyard? According to Rabbi Meir, even a single Jew who resides with a gentile may not carry in his courtyard, whether or not another Jew is present.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if you say </span>that indeed this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, that the Jew in the outer courtyard is of no consequence, and that he is only mentioned because <span class="gemarra-regular">the incident that took place, took place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in this way, </span>and those who came to ask the question provided all the details without knowing whether they were relevant, this is still difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t a dilemma raised</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Rav </span>himself with regard to this very issue: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing a Jew living in <span class="gemarra-regular">the inner</span> courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">place? </span>Can he carry in the inner courtyard? <span class="gemarra-regular">And he said to them: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">It is permitted </span>for him to carry there. Therefore, according to Rav, a gentile does not render it prohibited for a single Jew to carry, which is actually contrary to Rabbi Meir’s opinion.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what </span>else can you say? Can you say that he ruled <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ya’akov? Didn’t </span>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The gentile does not render it prohibited to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">unless</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there are two Jews </span>living in the same courtyard who themselves render it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited for one another </span>to carry without an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? In this case they do not render it prohibited for each other to carry without an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, as they do not live in the same courtyard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>you might say that he ruled <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, who said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">foot </span>of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who is permitted in his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">renders</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it prohibited not in its </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">place. </span>The Jew in the inner courtyard is permitted to carry in his own courtyard. However, in order to leave his courtyard, he passes through the outer one, in which it is prohibited for him to carry. Therefore, he renders it prohibited for the resident of the outer courtyard as well.
But if that is the case, the following difficulty arises: According to this opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile </span>in the inner courtyard? <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>single <span class="gemarra-regular">Jew </span>living in the inner courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">would also </span>suffice to render it prohibited for the resident of the outer courtyard to carry in his own courtyard, even if no gentiles were present at all.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said </span>that Rav’s ruling should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>Rav ruled <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">akov </span>with regard to a gentile, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva </span>with regard to a foot that renders it prohibited to carry. <span class="gemarra-regular">And with what we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are dealing here? </span>This is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the two Jews <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> with one another. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the reason </span>that Rav prohibited carrying in the outer courtyard is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is a gentile who renders it prohibited </span>to carry, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no gentile, it is not prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as the Jews established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with one another, and therefore they are permitted to carry.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer raised a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dilemma before Rav </span>as follows: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile </span>live together <span class="gemarra-regular">in the outer </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Jew </span>lives alone <span class="gemarra-regular">in the inner one, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? May they carry in the outer courtyard without renting from the gentile? One could argue as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case where the Jew and the gentile share the inner courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>the Sages prohibited carrying is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is common </span>for a Jew and a gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">live </span>together in such a fashion. Ordinarily a single Jew would not live together in the same courtyard as a gentile, for fear that the gentile might kill him. However, here, the Jew living in the inner courtyard believes <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">gentile would be afraid </span>to kill him, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">thinks </span>to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, </span>were I to kill my neighbor, the <span class="gemarra-regular">Jew </span>living in the outer courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">might come</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and say to me: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">Jew who used to </span>live <span class="gemarra-regular">by you, where is </span>he? The gentile would not be able to offer as an excuse that the Jew left, for the other Jew from outer courtyard would know whether or not he passed through his courtyard. Therefore, since that living arrangement is common, the decree applies, and the gentile’s residence in the courtyard renders it prohibited to carry there. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, here, </span>where the gentile lives in the outer courtyard, he is not afraid of killing his Jewish neighbor, as he says to himself: If the other Jew comes to question me, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will say to him: He went</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>way; I do not know where he went. In this case, the gentile would not be concerned that the Jew from the inner courtyard might question his story. Since it is uncommon for a Jew and a gentile to live together in such a fashion, the Sages did not issue a decree that the gentile’s residence renders the courtyard prohibited for carrying.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>one would say that <span class="gemarra-regular">here, too, </span>the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">would be afraid </span>to kill his Jewish neighbor, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he thinks </span>to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>were I to kill my neighbor, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Jew </span>living in the inner courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">might come </span>at any moment <span class="gemarra-regular">and see</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> me </span>in the act of killing his friend. Since the gentile does not know when the resident of the inner courtyard will pass through the outer courtyard, there is a chance his crime might be witnessed. In that case, it would not be uncommon for a Jew and a gentile to live together in such a fashion, and the Sages’ decree that the gentile’s residence renders carrying prohibited would apply.
Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Eliezer the following verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Give to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a wise man, and he will be yet wiser” </span>(Proverbs 9:9), i.e., it is proper to be stringent even in such a case. Consequently, carrying is prohibited in the outer courtyard unless the Jews rent from the gentile.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish and the students of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥanina happened </span>to come on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">to a certain inn</span> that had at least three permanent residents, two Jews and a gentile who rented their quarters from the gentile innkeeper. Although <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">tenant was not </span>present on that Shabbat, the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">landlord was </span>present. Concerned that the gentile tenant might return during Shabbat and render it prohibited for them to carry, Rabbi Ḥanina’s students wondered whether the gentile landlord can rent out the gentile’s room again for the purpose of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">They</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to renting from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him? </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Anywhere that </span>the landlord <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot remove</span> the tenant, <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">not raise the dilemma, for they</span> clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot rent </span>it from him. If the landlord is unable to expel the tenant, the residence temporarily belongs completely to the tenant, and only he can rent it out. <span class="gemarra-regular">Where you </span>need to <span class="gemarra-regular">raise the dilemma </span>is with regard to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where he can remove him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Does one say that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the landlord <span class="gemarra-regular">can</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> remove </span>the tenant, <span class="gemarra-regular">they can rent </span>the residence from him, as the landlord retains a measure of control over it, and therefore he can rent it out again for the purpose of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps now, in any </span><span class="gemarra-regular">case he has not </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">removed him, </span>which means the residence is still entirely under the tenant’s jurisdiction?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said to them: Let us rent </span>it now, as the principle is that one may act leniently in a case of doubt involving a rabbinic prohibition, <span class="gemarra-regular">and when we arrive at our Sages in the South</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we shall ask them </span>whether we acted properly. Later <span class="gemarra-regular">they came and asked Rabbi Afes, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: You acted well when you rented </span>it from the landlord. 
The Gemara relates a similar incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Yosef and Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba and Rabbi Asi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> happened </span>to come <span class="gemarra-regular">to a certain inn, and the gentile</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> innkeeper, </span>who was absent when Shabbat began, <span class="gemarra-regular">came on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. They said: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to renting</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from him </span>now? The Gemara explains the two sides of the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is renting </span>from a gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">like making </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as one who establishes an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> may do so only <span class="gemarra-regular">while it is still day,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so </span>too, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who rents </span>a gentile’s property must do so <span class="gemarra-regular">while it is still day. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps one who rents </span>from a gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">is like one who renounces </span>rights to his <span class="gemarra-regular">domain; just</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as one who renounces </span>rights to his <span class="gemarra-regular">domain </span>may do so <span class="gemarra-regular">even on Shabbat </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>too, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who rents</span> a gentile’s property may do so <span class="gemarra-regular">even on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>In that case, they would be able to rent from the gentile in exchange for something of value, even on Shabbat itself. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yosef said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Let us rent, </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi said: Let us not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rent. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said to them: Let us</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rely </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">on the words of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Elder, </span>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yosef, <span class="gemarra-regular">and rent. </span>Later <span class="gemarra-regular">they came and asked Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan </span>about the matter, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to them: </span>

Daf 66a

<span class="gemarra-regular">You acted well when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you rented</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Neharde’a wondered </span>at this teaching: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? Didn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan say </span>just the opposite: <span class="gemarra-regular">Renting </span>from a gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">is like establishing an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? What, is </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>to be understood as imposing a stringency: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">establishes an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> may do so only <span class="gemarra-regular">while it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> still day, so </span>too, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">rents </span>a gentile’s property must do so <span class="gemarra-regular">while it is still day?</span>
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>his statement was intended as a leniency: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as one who establishes an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> may do so <span class="gemarra-regular">even with less than the value of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>too, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who rents </span>a gentile’s property may rent it for <span class="gemarra-regular">less than the value of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And just as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who establishes an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> need not be the owner himself, but <span class="gemarra-regular">even his hired laborer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or harvester </span>may do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>too, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rents </span>a gentile’s property need not rent from the landlord himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>may rent <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">his hired laborer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or harvester </span>who are acting on his behalf. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who establishes an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that if <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">live in the same courtyard, one </span>of them may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> with the residents of a different courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">on behalf of them all, so </span>too, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who rents </span>a gentile’s property; if <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">live in the same courtyard </span>together with a gentile, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of them may <span class="gemarra-regular">rent </span>the gentile’s property <span class="gemarra-regular">on behalf of them all</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar wondere</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> at Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling that the Sages had acted well when they rented the gentile’s property on Shabbat and then they renounced their rights to that one, so that at least it would be permitted to use the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: What </span>was the reason for <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar’s wonder? Rav Sheshet </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>Can it be that <span class="gemarra-regular">such a great person as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira did not know what </span>was the source <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar’s wonder? He had difficulty with </span>a statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of his teacher, Shmuel. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Shmuel said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any place where </span>the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">render it prohibited for </span>each other to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish a </span>joint <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> if they so desire, in order to permit carrying, each may <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce </span>his property rights for the other if they failed to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> before Shabbat. However, in a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the residents may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together <span class="gemarra-regular">but they do not render it prohibited </span>for each other for carrying, or where <span class="gemarra-regular">they render it prohibited for </span>each other for carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">but they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together, in such situations <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not renounce </span>their property rights for each other. 
The Gemara clarifies the above teaching: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any place where </span>the residents render it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for each other to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, they may renounce </span>their rights for each other, <span class="gemarra-regular">such as </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two courtyards, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one within the other. </span>The residents of the two courtyards render each other prohibited to carry between the courtyards, but they may establish a joint <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in order to permit carrying. In such a case, the residents may renounce their property rights for each other if they failed to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> before Shabbat.
In a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the residents may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together <span class="gemarra-regular">but they do not render </span>each other <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not renounce </span>their property rights for each other, in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> courtyards </span>both opening to an alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">that have a single</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> opening between them. </span>Even though the two courtyards may establish a joint <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> and be considered a single courtyard, they do not render it prohibited for each other to carry if they did not do so, because neither needs to make use of the other. Consequently, there is no option of renouncing rights in favor of the other courtyard.
In a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they render </span>each other <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">but they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>does this come <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> include? </span>In reference to which case did Shmuel make this statement? <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it </span>meant to <span class="gemarra-regular">include a gentile </span>who shares a courtyard with two Jews? The Jewish residents of the courtyard render each other prohibited from carrying in such a case, but they may not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> due to the presence of the gentile.
The Gemara further analyzes the case: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, if </span>it is referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">arrived on the previous day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., before Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him rent </span>the property from the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">on the previous day. </span>Before Shabbat, both options were available: They could have either established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> or one Jew could have renounced his rights in favor of the other. Therefore, it would not have been considered a situation in which they render each other prohibited to carry but cannot establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. 

Daf 66b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it not </span>referring to a case where the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">arrived</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat, and </span>Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: </span>In a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they render </span>each other <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">but they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> together, </span>in such a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not renounce </span>their rights for each other. Therefore, you can <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from this </span>that if the gentile arrived on Shabbat, they cannot rent his property and then renounce their rights to one of them. This explains Rabbi Elazar’s surprise at Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling, as it appears to contradict this teaching of Shmuel, his first teacher.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: I have not heard this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of Shmuel’s with regard to two courtyards situated one within the other, that the residents of the inner courtyard may renounce their rights to the outer courtyard in favor of the residents of that courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: You </span>yourself <span class="gemarra-regular">told </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to us. </span>Rav Yosef forgot his studies due to illness, so his student Abaye would remind him of his own teachings. Abaye continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it was with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you told </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to us. As Shmuel said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: There is no renunciation of rights from one courtyard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> another. </span>In other words, while one may renounce his rights to his own courtyard for the other residents of that courtyard, he may not renounce his rights to another courtyard for the residents of that courtyard. 
Likewise, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no renunciation of </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">rights</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a ruin. </span>If a ruin was shared by two houses, neither can renounce its rights to the ruin in favor of the other. The Sages instituted renunciation of rights only with regard to a courtyard, as that is the typical case. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to us with regard to </span>this matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said that there is no renouncing of rights from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one courtyard to another, we said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two courtyards, </span>one alongside the other and each opening into an alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">that have a single </span><span class="gemarra-regular">opening between them. However, </span>if the two courtyards were situated <span class="gemarra-regular">one within the other, since </span>the residents of the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">render each other prohibited </span>from carrying, <span class="gemarra-regular">they may </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce</span> their rights in favor of each other.
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Abaye in surprise: <span class="gemarra-regular">I said that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the name of Shmuel? Didn’t Shmuel say: We</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may </span>be lenient with regard to the laws of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only in accordance with the wording of the mishna, </span>which states that the <span class="gemarra-regular">residents of a courtyard, </span>in the singular, may renounce their rights, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not the residents of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyards </span>in the plural. Therefore, the option of renouncing rights does not apply to two courtyards.
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: When you told us </span>this ruling of Shmuel’s that <span class="gemarra-regular">we may </span>be lenient with regard to the laws of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only in accordance with </span>the wording of <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna, you said it to us with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the following </span>mishna, which states: <span class="gemarra-regular">That an alleyway in relation </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyards is like a courtyard in relation to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">houses. </span>Shmuel inferred from this that there must be at least two courtyards with two houses each that open into an alleyway in order to permit carrying there by means of a side post or a cross beam. 
The Gemara examines the ruling of Shmuel that was cited in the previous discussion. Returning to <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter itself, Shmuel said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: There is no renunciation of rights from one courtyard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> another, and there is no renunciation of rights in a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ruin. But Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>disagreed and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: There is renunciation</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of rights from one courtyard to another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is renunciation of rights in a ruin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara comments: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to explain that Shmuel and Rabbi Yoḥanan disagreed with regard to both cases, as neither case could have been learned from the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had taught </span>only that there is no renunciation of rights <span class="gemarra-regular">from one courtyard to another, </span>one could have said that it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span>case that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that there is no renunciation of rights, <span class="gemarra-regular">because the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> use </span>of the one courtyard stands <span class="gemarra-regular">alone and the use</span> of the other courtyard stands <span class="gemarra-regular">alone. </span>Each courtyard is not used by the residents of the other courtyard, and therefore there is no renunciation of rights from one courtyard to the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a ruin, where there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is one </span>common <span class="gemarra-regular">use for both </span>neighbors, as the residents of both houses use it, <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes to Rabbi Yoḥanan.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">if it was stated </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the case of a ruin, one could have said that it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span>case that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>his position, <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to the other </span>case, renouncing rights from one courtyard to another, perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">he concedes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Shmuel. </span>Therefore, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach both cases.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which Shmuel said, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no renunciation</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of rights from one courtyard to another, we said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to two courtyards, </span>one alongside the other and each opening into an alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">that have a single</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> opening between them. However, </span>if there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two courtyards, one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> within the other, since </span>the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">render </span>each other <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited</span> to carry, <span class="gemarra-regular">they may </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce </span>their rights in favor of each other.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Even </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two courtyards, one within the other, sometimes </span>the residents may <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce </span>their rights in favor of each other, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sometimes they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not renounce </span>them. <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>so? If the residents of the two courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">placed their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in the outer </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot </span>to do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>he was a resident <span class="gemarra-regular">of the inner </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">or of the outer </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> with the others, then it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry in <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>courtyards. The person who neglected to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> renders it prohibited for the residents of both courtyards to carry, because the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for both courtyards is located in the outer one, and it is prohibited to carry there without an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> due to the right of passage of the residents of the inner courtyard through the outer courtyard. Therefore, there is no effective <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> at all, not even for the residents of the inner courtyard.
However, if the residents of the two courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">placed their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the inner </span>courtyard, the following distinction applies: <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span> a resident <span class="gemarra-regular">of the inner </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, both </span>courtyards are <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>In that case, it is prohibited to carry in the inner courtyard itself, due to the one who did not join in the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. Since the inner courtyard is prohibited, it also renders the outer one prohibited, as the residents of the inner courtyard must pass through it. 
On the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>resident <span class="gemarra-regular">of the outer </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot and did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to carry in <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inner </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry in <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">outer </span>courtyard. The residents of the inner courtyard have an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, as they established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> together, and therefore they may carry in their courtyard. The residents of the outer courtyard do not render it prohibited for them to carry, as they do not have the right to pass through the inner courtyard, and the inhabitants of the latter could bar their entrance to the inner courtyard by locking their doors.
The Gemara explains why the residents of these courtyards cannot avail themselves of the option of renunciation: If the residents of the two courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">placed their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in the outer </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot </span>to do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>he was a resident <span class="gemarra-regular">of the inner </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">or of the outer </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> with the others, then it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry in <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>courtyards, and the person who forgot to join in the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> cannot renounce his rights to the courtyard. The reason for this is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">That resident of the inner </span>courtyard who forgot to place his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of whom can he renounce </span>his rights? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him renounce </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">residents of the inner </span>courtyard, yet that is ineffective, as <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not with them </span>but in the outer courtyard. Consequently, they would remain without an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, which means they would render it prohibited to carry in the outer courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him renounce </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> residents of the outer </span>courtyard, but that too is ineffective, as Shmuel ruled that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no renunciation of rights</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from one courtyard to another.</span>
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> resident of the outer </span>courtyard who forgot to place his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of whom can he renounce </span>his rights? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him renounce </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of the residents </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the outer </span>courtyard, but <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">the inner </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">that renders them prohibited </span>from carrying. <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him renounce</span> them <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of the residents of the inner </span>courtyard, but <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no renunciation of rights from one courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to another. </span>Therefore, the mechanism of permitting carrying by means of renunciation cannot be applied in these cases. 
Likewise, if the residents of the two courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">placed their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the inner </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span>resident <span class="gemarra-regular">of the inner </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot </span>to do so <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry in <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>courtyards. The reason is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">That resident</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the inner </span>courtyard who forgot to place his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of whom can he renounce </span>his rights? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him renounce </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of the residents of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the inner </span>courtyard, yet <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">the outer </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">that renders them prohibited </span>from carrying, as the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> shared by the courtyards is in essence a valid <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, which gives the residents of the outer courtyard the right to enter the inner one. <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him renounce </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the residents of the outer </span>courtyard, but that is ineffective, as Shmuel maintains that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no renunciation of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rights from one courtyard to another. </span>In that case, since the inner courtyard is prohibited, it renders it prohibited to carry in the outer one as well. 

Daf 67a

But <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>a resident <span class="gemarra-regular">of the outer </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot and did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to carry in the <span class="gemarra-regular">inner </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>its residents <span class="gemarra-regular">can close the door </span>between the two courtyards, thereby preventing the residents of the outer courtyard from entering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they can then <span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>their courtyard on their own. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>it is still <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry in <span class="gemarra-regular">the outer </span>courtyard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehoshua, said to Rava: And if a </span>resident <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the inner </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot and did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry in <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>courtyards? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the resident of the inner </span>courtyard who forgot to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce </span>his rights <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">residents of the inner courtyard, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the outer </span>courtyard, who had established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with the inner one, <span class="gemarra-regular">come and be permitted </span>to carry together <span class="gemarra-regular">with them.</span>
Rava replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with whose </span>opinion do you make this suggestion? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, who said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: It is not necessary to renounce </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">rights in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> favor of each and every </span>resident. Rather, it is enough for a person to renounce his rights in favor of a single person, as once he no longer has any rights in the courtyard, he can no longer render it prohibited to carry there. According to this approach, a resident of the inner courtyard may indeed renounce his rights in favor of the other residents of his courtyard. The outer courtyard would then be rendered permitted together with the inner courtyard. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">when I spoke, </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with the </span>opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, who say: It is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">necessary to renounce </span>one’s rights <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of each </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and every </span>resident. Therefore, in order to render the outer courtyard permitted, it would be necessary for the person who forgot to establish the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> to renounce his rights in favor of the residents of the outer courtyard as well. However, he may not do so, as one may not renounce rights from one courtyard to another. Therefore, the outer courtyard may not be rendered permitted in this manner.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rav Ḥisda and Rav Sheshet would meet each </span><span class="gemarra-regular">other, Rav Ḥisda’s lips would trembl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the teachings</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav Sheshet. </span>Rav Sheshet’s fluency and expertise were such that Rav Ḥisda would be filled with awe in his presence. For his part, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet’s entire body</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would shake from Rav Ḥisda’s sharpness, </span>i.e., from his brilliant, analytical mind. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda raised a dilemma before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Sheshet: </span>If there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>unconnected <span class="gemarra-regular">houses on two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sides of a public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and gentiles came and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enclosed them </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a partition on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? By erecting the fence, the gentiles nullified the public domain between the two houses, turning it into a private domain. Consequently, carrying from one house to the other is permitted by Torah law. The question is: Is it possible to render it permitted to carry even by rabbinic law? Can one resident renounce his rights to the area between the houses and thereby allow the other to carry there? 
The Gemara clarifies the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> renouncing of rights from one courtyard to another, you have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no dilemma, </span>as carrying is certainly prohibited. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, if </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where had they wanted to establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> yesterday they could have established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>e.g., in a case of two adjacent courtyards with an entranceway between them, <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no renouncing of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rights from one courtyard to another, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in a case of two houses situated on opposite sides of a public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">where had they wanted to establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">yesterday they could not have established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>because of the public domain between the houses, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>clear that there is no renouncing of rights? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Where you have a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dilemma is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is renouncing of rights from one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> courtyard to another, </span>and the two sides of the question are as follows: Perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">there, where had they wanted to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> yesterday they could have established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> then, <span class="gemarra-regular">they can also renounce </span>rights now. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where they could not have established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> yesterday </span>even had they wanted to, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not renounce rights </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">either. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no difference </span>between the two cases. Since renunciation of rights is possible under the current circumstances, yesterday’s situation is not taken into account. Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Ḥisda: In such a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not renounce </span>his rights.
Rav Ḥisda posed a similar question: If two Jews and a gentile shared a courtyard, and no steps had been taken prior to Shabbat to render it permitted to carry in the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the gentile die</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Since the gentile died, he no longer imposes restrictions on carrying in the courtyard. May one Jew now renounce his rights in favor of the other and thereby render it permitted for him to carry in the courtyard?
The Gemara clarifies the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">rent </span>from a gentile who arrives on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">you have no dilemma. Now </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">perform two </span>actions, both rent and renounce rights, as the Jewish neighbors may rent from the gentile and subsequently each could renounce his rights in favor of the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state that we may perform <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>action? Each Jew may certainly renounce his rights in favor of the other. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, there is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a dilemma in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not rent </span>from the gentile in such a case. The two sides of the question are as follows: Perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">it is two </span>actions <span class="gemarra-regular">that we </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not perform, </span>rent and renounce; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, one </span>action alone <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">perform; or perhaps </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no difference </span>between one action and two. Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Ḥisda: <span class="gemarra-regular">I say </span>that in such a case <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">renounc</span>e his rights, <span class="gemarra-regular">while </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">Hamnuna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not renounce </span>his rights.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>lives in a courtyard that opens into an alleyway in which many Jews reside, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">entrance </span>on the other side of the courtyard, even one that is only <span class="gemarra-regular">four by four </span>handbreadths in size, that <span class="gemarra-regular">opens</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into a valley, </span>then in such a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all day </span>long <span class="gemarra-regular">he brings camels and wagons in and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out </span>of his courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">by way of the alleyway, </span>so that it is evident that he uses the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span> nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">does not render it prohibited for the residents of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the alleyway </span>to carry. He is not considered a resident of the alleyway alongside them, as the entrance from the field is viewed as the true entrance to his courtyard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the reason </span>that his small entrance from the field is considered his main entrance? Because <span class="gemarra-regular">the entrance that is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exclusively his is preferable to him. </span>Despite its small size, the gentile views the entrance from the field as his main entrance, while he uses the one that opens into the alleyway only when it is convenient.
Based on this assumption, <span class="gemarra-regular">a dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: If the gentile’s courtyard opens into an alleyway in which Jews reside, and it also has an entrance that <span class="gemarra-regular">opens </span><span class="gemarra-regular">into an enclosure </span>rather than into a valley, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Which entrance is considered his primary entrance? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman bar Ami said, citing a tradition [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mishmei de’ulpana</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>he received from his teachers: 

Daf 67b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if it <span class="gemarra-regular">opens into an enclosure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> this is considered its main entrance, rather than the one that opens into the alleyway.
It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba and Rav Yosef who both say: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in such a case depends on the identity of the owner of the courtyard. With regard to a courtyard owned by <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile, </span>if the enclosure behind his courtyard is the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> or less, <span class="gemarra-regular">he renders it prohibited </span>for the Jewish residents of the alleyway to carry. An enclosure of this size is not large enough for all the gentile’s needs, and therefore his main entrance is the one that opens into the alleyway. However, if the enclosure is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he does not render</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it prohibited </span>for the residents of the alleyway to carry, as such an enclosure is sufficient for all his needs. 
On the other hand, with regard to a courtyard owned by <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>if the enclosure is the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’a</span> or less, <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not render it prohibited </span>for the other residents of the alleyway to carry, even if he did not join in an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with them. Because he has the option of carrying in such an enclosure on Shabbat, he would not carry in the alleyway, as it is more convenient for him to carry in a place that belongs exclusively to him. 
However, if the enclosure is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in which case it is prohibited to carry there, the Jew would carry only by way of the alleyway. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">he renders it prohibited </span>for his fellow residents of the alleyway to carry unless he establishes an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with them.
With regard to this issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava bar Ḥaklai raised </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a dilemma before Rav Huna: </span>If the gentile’s courtyard opens into an alleyway, and it also has an entrance that <span class="gemarra-regular">opens into an enclosure, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? He <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: They have </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that if the enclosure is the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> or less, the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">renders it prohibited </span>for the Jewish residents of the alleyway to carry; however, if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">more</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he does not render it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited </span>for them to carry. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an enclosure greater than </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was not </span>originally <span class="gemarra-regular">surrounded </span>by a fence <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span> the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">residence, even </span>if it is as large as a field that produces a crop of one <span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and even two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, one who </span>inadvertently <span class="gemarra-regular">throws </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">into it </span>from the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>to bring a sin-offering, like one who throws into a private domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? It is because the partition of an enclosure <span class="gemarra-regular">is a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">partition. </span>Consequently, the enclosure is considered a private domain by Torah law, <span class="gemarra-regular">except that it is lacking residents, </span>and therefore the Sages did not permit one to carry inside it as in a proper private domain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana raised</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an objection </span>from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rock </span>protruding from <span class="gemarra-regular">the sea </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not carry from it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the sea or from the sea to it </span>on Shabbat. The rock has the status of a private domain, while the sea is a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, and it is prohibited to carry from a private domain into a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> or vice versa on Shabbat. If the rock <span class="gemarra-regular">is smaller</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than this, </span>either in height or width, so that it is no longer considered a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">carry</span> to or from it. <span class="gemarra-regular">How large </span>may the rock be? It may be <span class="gemarra-regular">up to </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara attempts to clarify the meaning of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">To which</span> part of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is the clause: Up to the size of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, referring? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the latter clause, </span>can it be that with regard to a rock that is less than ten handbreadths high, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that carrying is permitted if the rock is up to the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">no more </span>than that? <span class="gemarra-regular">Wouldn’t he be carrying from one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to another, </span>which is certainly permitted? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it not </span>referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the first clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this is </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is saying: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a rock </span>protruding from <span class="gemarra-regular">the sea </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high and four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide, one may not carry from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it to the sea or from the sea to it, </span>as it has the status of a private domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">how large </span>may it be for this prohibition to apply? <span class="gemarra-regular">Up to </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. But </span>if the rock is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">carry. Apparently, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span> in all respects, and not just as a stringency. This appears to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>Only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who does not know how to explain </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mishnayot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raises </span>such <span class="gemarra-regular">refutations against Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>one of the greatest Sages of his generation. Rather, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is to be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the final words of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> refer <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the first clause, and this is </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is saying</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>With regard to a rock protruding from the sea that is ten handbreadths high and four handbreadths wide, one may not carry from it to the sea or from the sea to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">but within it, </span>on the rock itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">carry, </span>as it is considered a private domain. And <span class="gemarra-regular">how large </span>may the rock be and remain permitted? <span class="gemarra-regular">Up to two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> may be explained differently, yet still in a manner that does not refute the words of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the final words of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> refer <span class="gemarra-regular">to the first clause</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as stated by Rav Huna bar Ḥanina. However, one may not infer from them a principle with regard to enclosures, as <span class="gemarra-regular">they said </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is stringent in one case, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they sai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> should be lenient in a different case, i.e., the same Sages who were stringent in one case were lenient in the another. 
How so? <span class="gemarra-regular">They said </span>that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an enclosure greater than </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was not </span>originally <span class="gemarra-regular">enclosed </span>with a fence <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">carry only </span>a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits, </span>as it has the status of a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> in this regard. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not carry from a private domain to a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Both of these <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> are decrees of the Sages. 
Therefore, the Sages developed the following principles: With regard to a rock that is no larger than <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to carry on all of it, the Sages prohibited carrying</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the sea to it and from it to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sea. What is the reason </span>for this? It is that the rock <span class="gemarra-regular">is a full-fledged private domain, </span>and they did not permit one to carry from a private domain to a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> or vice versa. 
However, if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">larger than </span>the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is prohibited to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> carry on all of it </span>by rabbinic decree, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted carrying from the sea to it and from it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the sea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What is the reason </span>for this? It is because the Sages were concerned that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>people would <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a proper private domain, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and they would come to carry on all of it. </span>Were the Sages to prohibit carrying from the rock to the sea, people would think that it is a full-fledged private domain, and they would carry on it. Since all these decrees are rabbinic in nature, the Sages permitted carrying from a private domain to a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> in this case in order to prevent people from violating a different rabbinic decree, which prohibits carrying in an enclosure that is greater than the size of two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>. However, no general conclusion may be inferred from this that an enclosure larger than two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> is not a private domain by Torah law.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the difference </span>between the decrees that caused the Sages to choose to uphold the one decree and not the other? The Gemara answers: The difference is that carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>the rock <span class="gemarra-regular">is common</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whereas carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">from it to the sea and from the sea to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is not common. </span>The Sages permitted carrying in the less likely scenario in order to reinforce the decree against carrying within the rock, the more common situation.
The Gemara now relates that there was once <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain baby whose warm</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> water, </span>which had been prepared for his Shabbat circumcision, <span class="gemarra-regular">spilled</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rabba said to them: Let them bring warm water for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him from my house. Abaye said to him: But we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> in the courtyard, so it is prohibited to carry the water.
Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: Let us rely on the merging </span>of alleyways, which may serve in place of a joining of courtyards in pressing circumstances such as these. Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But we did not establish a merging </span>of alleyways either. Rabba replied: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let them instruct a gentil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to bring </span>the warm water <span class="gemarra-regular">for him, </span>even though it is generally prohibited to instruct a gentile to perform labor for a Jew that involves a desecration of Shabbat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: I wanted to raise an objection against the Master, </span>Rabba, <span class="gemarra-regular">but Rav Yosef would not let me </span>do so, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana said: When we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were in Rav Yehuda’s house, he would say to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us </span>when we were presented with a halakhic difficulty: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a Torah law, we </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">raise objections and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">then we perform an act, </span>i.e., if someone has an objection to a proposed action, we must first clarify the matter and only then may we proceed. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to rabbinic laws, we </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">perform an act and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">then </span>we <span class="gemarra-regular">raise objections.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Afterward, </span>when they had brought the water, Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">objection did you wish to raise against the Master, </span>Rabba? He <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sprinkling </span>the water of purification on an impure person on Shabbat is not prohibited by Torah law; rather, it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">a rabbinic decre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to enhance the character of Shabbat as a day of rest. <span class="gemarra-regular">And telling a gentile</span> to perform a Shabbat labor on behalf of a Jew is likewise only <span class="gemarra-regular">a rabbinic decree. </span>

Daf 68a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Just as sprinkling </span>the water of purification is prohibited by <span class="gemarra-regular">rabbinic decree and does not override Shabbat, </span>even for the purpose of a mitzva, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, telling a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gentile </span>to perform a prohibited labor Shabbat is prohibited by <span class="gemarra-regular">rabbinic decree and does not override Shabbat. </span>How, then, could Rabba suggest that they instruct a gentile and thus transgress a rabbinic decree?
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But do you not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">differentiate between a rabbinic decree that involves an action and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a rabbinic decree that does not involve an action</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">As the Master, </span>Rabba, <span class="gemarra-regular">did not say to the gentile: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Go and heat </span>water on Shabbat, but only told him to transfer something from one domain to another, which does not involve an action and is therefore less severe.
Upon hearing of this incident and the ensuing discussion, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to Abaye: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway that contains two such</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> great people as the Sages </span>Rabba and Abaye, is it possible that <span class="gemarra-regular">there could be neither an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> merging </span>of alleyways? Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we do? </span>As for <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master, </span>Rabba, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his manner </span>to go and collect for the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> from all the residents of the alleyway. As for <span class="gemarra-regular">myself, I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">am busy with my studies </span>and do not have time to take care of this issue. And <span class="gemarra-regular">they, </span>the other residents of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not attend to </span>such matters.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if I were to transfer to </span>the residents of the alleyway a share of the <span class="gemarra-regular">bread </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">basket, </span>so as to allow them to join a merging of alleyways, <span class="gemarra-regular">since if they would want </span>to take it <span class="gemarra-regular">from me it would be impossible </span>for me <span class="gemarra-regular">to give it to them </span>because I am poor and need the small amount of bread that I can afford for myself, the <span class="gemarra-regular">merging </span>of alleyways would therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">be invalid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the residents of an alleyway requested wine or oil</span> from the merging of alleyways, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they did not give</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him </span>any, <span class="gemarra-regular">the merging </span>of alleyways <span class="gemarra-regular">is invalid. </span>This is because it has become evident that he is not considered a true partner in it.
Rabba bar Rav Ḥanin further asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let the Master transfer to them a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">quarter-</span><span class="it-text">log</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of vinegar in </span>one of his <span class="gemarra-regular">barrels; </span>certainly even Abaye could afford to provide such a small amount of vinegar for the rest of the residents. Abaye replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not use </span>food in a <span class="gemarra-regular">storeroom for a merging </span>of alleyways, as it is not clear which specific portion of the food is being set aside for that purpose. The same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> would apply to an unspecified quarter-<span class="it-text">log</span> of vinegar in a barrel.
Rabba bar Rav Ḥanin raised a difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may use </span>stored food <span class="gemarra-regular">for a merging </span>of alleyways? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Oshaya said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>source, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that states that one may not use stored food for a merging of alleyways, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai. </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>source, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that states that it is permitted to do so, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel. </span>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree about whether or not to apply the principle of retroactive clarification.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a corpse is in a house, </span>and the house <span class="gemarra-regular">has many entrances</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they are all ritually impure. </span>It is currently unknown through which entrance the corpse will be removed from the house, and any of the entrances might be used for this purpose. Therefore, they all contract impurity imparted by a corpse in a tent as though the corpse had already passed through each of them.
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them was open, that </span>particular entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">is ritually impure, </span>as the corpse will certainly be removed through it, <span class="gemarra-regular">while all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the others are ritually pure. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one decided </span>from the outset <span class="gemarra-regular">to remove </span>the corpse <span class="gemarra-regular">through one of </span>the entrances, <span class="gemarra-regular">or through a window that is four by four</span> handbreadths in size, <span class="gemarra-regular">it saves all of the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">entrances</span> from contracting impurity. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: This </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">if he had decided</span> on an entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">before the person died, </span>so that the entrance through which his body would be removed was already determined at the time of death. <span class="gemarra-regular">But Beit Hillel say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>This applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if he decided the matter only <span class="gemarra-regular">after</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the person had died, </span>as the principle of retroactive selection is invoked and the entrance through which the deceased will be removed has been retroactively established. The same dispute applies to a merging of alleyways with an unspecified portion of stored food, and it revolves around whether it can be retroactively established that a specific portion had been set aside for the merging of alleyways.
The Gemara relates another story about <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain baby whose</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> warm water, </span>which had been prepared for his Shabbat circumcision, <span class="gemarra-regular">spilled</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rava said to </span>those who had brought the matter to his attention: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us ask the </span>baby’s <span class="gemarra-regular">mother. If </span>the warm water is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for her health, <span class="gemarra-regular">let a gentile heat </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the baby <span class="gemarra-regular">indirectly, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">through his mother. </span>In other words, the water may be heated for the mother, as a woman after childbirth is regarded as being in a life-threatening situation. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mesharshiya said to Rava: </span>The baby’s <span class="gemarra-regular">mother </span>is healthy enough that <span class="gemarra-regular">she is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eating dates. </span>Certainly her condition is not precarious enough to necessitate the heating of water. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>It is possible to <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it was merely a ravenous </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hunger that had seized her, </span>and she is unaware of what she is eating, but in fact she is still dangerously ill. 
The Gemara relates yet another similar incident: There was once <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain baby whose warm water, </span>which had been prepared for his Shabbat circumcision, <span class="gemarra-regular">spilled. Rava, </span>who had water in his courtyard but had not established a joint <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with the adjacent courtyard where the baby was located, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>those who asked him about the matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">Clear</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> away my belongings from the men’s chamber, </span>which opens directly into my courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>inner <span class="gemarra-regular">women’s chamber</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which does not. Rava was concerned that he would come to carry his belongings into the courtyard, which would be prohibited once he had renounced his rights to it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I will go and sit there, </span>in the women’s chamber, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I will renounce </span>my rights to <span class="gemarra-regular">this courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in favor of </span>the residents of the baby’s courtyard, so that they will be able to transfer the warm water from one courtyard to the other.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rava: Didn’t Shmuel say: There is no </span><span class="gemarra-regular">renunciation of rights from one courtyard to another. </span>How, then, can you renounce your rights to your courtyard in this manner? Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said: There is renouncing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of rights from one courtyard to another.</span>
Ravina then asked Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Master does not hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, </span>

Daf 68b

<span class="gemarra-regular">let the Master remain in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his place, </span>i.e., in the men’s chamber, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">renounce </span>his rights to his courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor </span>of the residents of the baby’s courtyard, so that they may transfer the water from one courtyard to the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">then, </span>after the water has been moved, <span class="gemarra-regular">let them renounce</span> their rights <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of the Master, </span>so that he may once again carry in his courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>If two people who live in the same courtyard forgot to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, one person <span class="gemarra-regular">may renounce </span>his rights in favor of the other when he needs it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> the second person <span class="gemarra-regular">may then renounce </span>his rights in favor of the first when he needs it. 
Rava replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">In this</span> regard, <span class="gemarra-regular">I hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who said: One </span>person may <span class="gemarra-regular">not renounce </span>his rights in favor of the other <span class="gemarra-regular">and then </span>subsequently have the second person <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce </span>his rights in favor of the first.
Ravina raised a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t the reason </span>for both <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>and the same? <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not renounce </span>his rights in favor of the other <span class="gemarra-regular">and then </span>subsequently have the other <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce </span>his rights in favor of the first? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it not because </span>it is assumed that <span class="gemarra-regular">since he renounced his rights </span>to the courtyard, it is as if he has <span class="gemarra-regular">completely removed himself from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here, and he is </span>now considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like the resident of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a different courtyard, and </span>Shmuel holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span><span class="gemarra-regular">renouncing of rights from one courtyard to another? </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master should likewise not renounce </span>his rights to his courtyard. If you accept Shmuel’s opinion with regard to subsequent renouncing, you should likewise accept his opinion with regard to renunciation of rights from one courtyard to another.
Rava responded: That is not Shmuel’s reason for prohibiting subsequent renunciations. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, this is the rationale </span>for his opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">So that the words of the Sages should not be </span>a subject <span class="gemarra-regular">of laughter and mockery</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If it is permitted for one person to renounce his rights in favor of another and then for the second person to renounce his rights in favor of the first, the Sages’ enactment will lose all meaning. 
The Gemara proceeds to examine in greater detail the issue raised in the previous discussion. Returning to <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter itself, Rav said: </span>If two people who live in the same courtyard forgot to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, one <span class="gemarra-regular">may renounce </span>his rights in favor of the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">and then </span>the second person <span class="gemarra-regular">may renounce </span>his rights in favor of the first. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not renounce </span>his rights in favor of the other <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> then </span>subsequently have the second person <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce </span>his rights in favor of the first. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shmuel disagree about the </span>same point of <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute as the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis and Rabbi Eliezer. </span>Elsewhere it is taught that Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis disagree with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case where one of the residents of a courtyard forgot to join in the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, but subsequently renounced his rights to the courtyard on Shabbat. The dispute revolves around the status of this resident’s house. Rabbi Eliezer holds that it is prohibited for him to carry in and out of his house, while the other residents of the courtyard are permitted to do so. However, the Rabbis hold that the other residents are prohibited from carrying in and out of his house as well.
The suggestion is <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rav stated </span>his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who hold that even one who renounces his rights to his courtyard does not renounce his rights to his house. As he has not completely removed himself from the courtyard, the other residents may later go back and renounce their rights in his favor. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel stated</span> his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>He maintains that this resident has completely removed himself from the courtyard. Therefore, there is no possibility of others subsequently renouncing their rights in his favor, as he is no longer considered a resident of the courtyard.
The Gemara rejects this comparison: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: What I said is even in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Eliezer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who renounces his rights </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to his courtyard </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">renounces his rights to his house, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">only because people do not live in a house without </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard, </span>and therefore it is evident that he has renounced his rights to his house as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to </span>whether or not the person himself is considered entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">removed </span>from the courtyard to the extent that the others would be unable to then renounce their rights in his favor, <span class="gemarra-regular">did he state </span>this? According to this explanation, it is possible that Rav’s opinion concurs with Rabbi Eliezer’s statement.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said: What I said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is even in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. The Rabbis stated </span>their opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only there, </span>where they ruled: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which he has renounced, </span>i.e., his rights to his courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">is renounced; and </span>that which <span class="gemarra-regular">he has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not renounced, </span>i.e., his rights in his house, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not renounced. However, </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">that which he has renounced, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has removed himself completely. </span>Consequently, all agree that one who renounces his rights to his courtyard is no longer considered a resident of that place. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Aḥa bar Ḥana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: </span>This dispute between Rav and Shmuel is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>an earlier dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>We learned elsewhere in a mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gave </span>away <span class="gemarra-regular">his rights </span>to his share of the courtyard to the other residents of the courtyard by renouncing them after having forgotten to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with the other residents on the previous day, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he carried </span>something <span class="gemarra-regular">out </span>from his house into the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>he did so <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly, </span>forgetting that he had renounced his rights, <span class="gemarra-regular">or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> intentionally, he </span>once again <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for all the residents of the courtyard, as his action cancels his renunciation. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>If he did so <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, he renders </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for the other residents; but if he did it <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he does not render </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not that they disagree </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this: One Sage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>Rabbi Meir, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that a person who renounces his rights does not remove himself completely from his domain, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>person may <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce </span>his rights in favor of another, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the second person may <span class="gemarra-regular">then renounce </span>his rights in favor of the first. As a result, even an inadvertent act of carrying serves to cancel the renunciation. And <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that one who renounces his rights removes himself completely from his domain, and therefore one person <span class="gemarra-regular">may not renounce </span>his rights in favor of another <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> then </span>subsequently have the second person <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce </span>his rights in favor of the first. In that case, only an intentional act of carrying can cancel the renunciation. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Taḥalifa said in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> name of Rava: No, everyone agrees </span>that a person who renounces his rights removes himself completely from his domain, and therefore one person <span class="gemarra-regular">may not renounce </span>his rights in favor of another <span class="gemarra-regular">and then </span>subsequently have the second person <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce</span> his rights in favor of the first. <span class="gemarra-regular">And here, they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disagree </span>with regard to the question: Did the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">penalize</span> an <span class="gemarra-regular">unwitting </span>offender <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>an <span class="gemarra-regular">intentional </span>offender? <span class="gemarra-regular">One Sage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>Rabbi Meir, who states that the resident always renders carrying prohibited for the others, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they penalized </span>an <span class="gemarra-regular">unwitting</span> offender <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>an <span class="gemarra-regular">intentional </span>offender. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda, who states that the resident renders carrying prohibited for the others only if he acted intentionally, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not penalize </span>an <span class="gemarra-regular">unwitting </span>offender <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>an <span class="gemarra-regular">intentional</span> offender.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi, </span>disagreeing with the Gemara’s refutation, <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Rav and Shmuel disagree in the </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute as </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis.</span>
It was stated in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Gamliel said: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving a certain Sadducee</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who lived with us </span>in the same alleyway in Jerusalem, who renounced his rights in the alleyway before Shabbat. The mishna then continues with a discussion about how and whether the alleyway may be used on Shabbat. The Gemara first poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">A Sadducee; who mentioned his name</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The mishna had thus far spoken only of a gentile, so why does Rabban Gamliel invoke an incident involving a Sadducee? 
The Gemara answers: The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete. </span>It is missing an important element, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is teaching: </span>The legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Sadducee is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentile, and Rabban Gamliel says: </span>The legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sadducee is not like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabban Gamliel </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> certain Sadducee who lived with us in </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in Jerusalem, </span>who renounced his rights in the alleyway before Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Father said to us: Hurry and take out</span> your <span class="gemarra-regular">utensils to the alleyway </span>to establish possession of it <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>he changes his mind and <span class="gemarra-regular">takes out </span>his utensils, in which case <span class="gemarra-regular">he would render it prohibited for you</span> to use the entire alleyway.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">wasn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the status of a Sadducee is a matter of dispute between <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one lives with a gentile, a Sadducee, or a Boethusian</span> in the same alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">they render </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">him. Rabban Gamliel says: A Sadducee or a Boethusian do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not prohibit </span>one from carrying. There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident </span><span class="gemarra-regular">involving a certain Sadducee who lived with Rabban Gamliel in </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway in Jerusalem, </span>and he renounced his rights to the alleyway before Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel said to his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sons: Hurry and take out </span>those utensils <span class="gemarra-regular">that you wish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to take out, and bring in </span>those utensils <span class="gemarra-regular">that you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wish to bring in, before that loathsome </span>person retracts his renunciation and <span class="gemarra-regular">takes out </span>his utensils <span class="gemarra-regular">and prohibits you </span>from using the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he renounced his rights in your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> favor; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>Rabban Gamliel spoke to them <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a different formulation, </span>saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">Hurry and do whatever you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">must do in the alleyway </span>prior to Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">before night </span><span class="gemarra-regular">falls and he prohibits you </span>from using the alleyway.
The Gemara proceeds to analyze this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>previously: <span class="gemarra-regular">Take</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out </span>those utensils <span class="gemarra-regular">that you wish to take out, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bring in </span>those utensils <span class="gemarra-regular">that you wish to bring in</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, before that loathsome </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">takes out </span>his utensils <span class="gemarra-regular">and prohibits</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you </span>from using the alleyway. The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say that, </span>according to Rabbi Meir, <span class="gemarra-regular">if they took out </span>their utensils <span class="gemarra-regular">and then </span>afterward the gentile or Sadducee <span class="gemarra-regular">took out his </span>utensils on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not render </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for them? 

Daf 69a

<span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>elsewhere in the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one gave </span>away <span class="gemarra-regular">his rights </span>in his courtyard to the other residents of the courtyard, renouncing them after having forgotten to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with them the previous day, and then <span class="gemarra-regular">he carried </span>something <span class="gemarra-regular">out </span>from his house into the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> unwittingly or intentionally, he </span>again <span class="gemarra-regular">renders it prohibited </span>for all the residents of the courtyard to carry; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. </span>This indicates that according to Rabbi Meir, even if the resident carried something into the courtyard on Shabbat itself, he cancels his renunciation, contrary to Rabbi Meir’s own statement in the mishna with regard to a Sadducee.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: Say </span>that Rabbi Meir’s statement should read instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">He does not render it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. Abaye said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as the contradiction between the two teachings of Rabbi Meir can be resolved as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>where the Sadducee cannot cancel his renunciation, it refers to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the residents of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway had </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">taken possessio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the alleyway </span>before he brought out his vessels; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>where the Jew cancels his renunciation, it refers to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">residents of the alleyway had not taken possession of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway </span>prior to his act of carrying.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to one who failed to join in an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with the other residents of his alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he carried </span>something from his house into the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he gave </span>away, i.e., renounced, <span class="gemarra-regular">his rights </span>in the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether unwittingly or intentionally, he can </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce </span>his rights; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>If he <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly </span>carried from his house into the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">he can </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce </span>his rights, but if he did so <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, he cannot renounce </span>them, for one who publicly transgresses the words of the Sages and intentionally desecrates Shabbat has the status of a gentile. 
However, if <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>away, i.e., renounced, <span class="gemarra-regular">his rights </span>in the alleyway, and then <span class="gemarra-regular">he carrie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> something from his house into the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether unwittingly or intentionally, he renders</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited </span>all the residents’ use of the alleyway, for his action cancels his renunciation; these are <span class="gemarra-regular">the words of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>If he did it <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> renders </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited; </span>but if he carried <span class="gemarra-regular">inadvertently, he does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not render </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said? In </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the residents of the alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had not </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">taken possession of the alleyway. But if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the residents of the alleyway had </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">taken possession of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the alleyway </span>before he carried something into the alleyway, all agree that <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>he did it <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly or intentionally, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not render prohibited </span>their use of the alleyway.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>above in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>Rabban Gamliel spoke to them <span class="gemarra-regular">with a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">different formulation, </span>saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">Hurry, and do whatever you must do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the alleyway </span>prior to Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">before night falls, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he will render prohibited your </span>use of the alleyway. <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is apparent </span>from this statement that a Sadducee <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile, </span>whose renunciation of his rights in an alleyway is ineffective. <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna that according to Rabbi Yehuda, he said: Hurry, and do whatever you have to do <span class="gemarra-regular">before he takes out</span> [ <span class="gemarra-italic">yotzi</span>] his vessels and renders prohibited your use of the alleyway, which implies that until then they may in fact use the alleyway; that is, his renunciation is effective?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that the mishna should read as follows: Hurry, and do whatever you have to do <span class="gemarra-regular">before the day goes out </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">yotzi hayom</span>], i.e., before the end of Friday. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>where the mishna implies that a Sadducee may renounce his rights in an alleyway, it refers <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an apostate </span>of the kind <span class="gemarra-regular">who desecrates Shabbat in private</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; here, </span>where the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> implies that a Sadducee may not renounce his rights in an alleyway, it refers <span class="gemarra-regular">to an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> apostate who desecrates Shabbat in public [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">befarhesya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Such a person is likened to a gentile in all regards, and therefore he may not renounce his rights in the alleyway.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with which</span> <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">that was taught </span>in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">An apostate or a brazen-faced </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> renounce his rights </span>in favor of his neighbors. Before discussing the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> itself, the Gemara wonders at the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">brazen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-faced </span>person. It would appear to mean an impudent person who acts against the Torah in a brazen manner, but <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>not such a one <span class="gemarra-regular">an apostate? </span>Why then are the two listed separately? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>read the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">A brazen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-faced apostate, </span>i.e., one who publicly displays his deviation from Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">may not renounce his rights </span>in favor of his neighbors. <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion was this stated? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara now relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">went out with a coral </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> into the public domain, and it is prohibited to do so on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">When he saw Rabbi Yehuda Nesi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> approaching, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>quickly <span class="gemarra-regular">covered it. </span>Although he was desecrating the Shabbat, he did not want the Sage to see it. Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>A person <span class="gemarra-regular">such as this, </span>who is careful not to desecrate Shabbat in public, <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">renounce his rights </span>in his courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda.</span>
In connection with the preceding discussion with regard to one who does not conform to Torah law, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: Who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is an apostate Jew? </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">one who desecrates Shabbat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in public. Rav Naḥman said to him: In accordance with </span>whose opinion did you say this? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he said this <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One who is suspected of </span>transgressing <span class="gemarra-regular">one matter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., someone who is known to have committed one transgression, <span class="gemarra-regular">is suspected of </span>transgressing <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire Torah, </span>he should be considered an apostate <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if he transgresses <span class="gemarra-regular">one of all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibitions of the Torah as well, </span>and not necessarily one as severe as Shabbat desecration.
<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he said this <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>it is difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t they say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>One who is <span class="gemarra-regular">suspected of </span>transgressing <span class="gemarra-regular">one matter is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> suspected of </span>transgressing <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire Torah, </span>

Daf 69b

<span class="gemarra-regular">unless he is an apostate with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">idolatry. </span>As long as he has not worshipped idols, his transgression of a single prohibition does not put him under suspicion of transgressing the rest of the Torah.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>Rav Huna was not attempting to offer a broad definition of an apostate, but was rather referring to the specific issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">giving </span>away <span class="gemarra-regular">rights or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">renouncing rights </span>in a domain with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And as it was taught </span>in the following <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">An apostate Jew, </span>if he <span class="gemarra-regular">observes his Shabbat in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the marketplace, </span>i.e., in public, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may renounce </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">rights </span>in a domain like a regular Jew, but if he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not observe his Shabbat in the marketplace, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may not renounce </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">rights </span>in a domain, as he is no longer considered a Jew in this regard. 
This distinction is significant <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said: A Jew may receive rights </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and give </span>away <span class="gemarra-regular">rights </span>in a domain through a mere statement of renunciation, <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to a gentile </span>it is not so, as he may not transfer his rights to others or renounce them in a domain <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">rents </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">out. How so? </span>A Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">may say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>his fellow: <span class="gemarra-regular">May my rights </span>in this domain <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">acquired by you, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">May my rights </span>in this domain <span class="gemarra-regular">be renounced to you, </span>and his fellow thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>those rights, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is not necessary that he take possession </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of it </span>through a formal mode of acquisition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>Rav Huna’s statement that a Jew who desecrates Shabbat in public is an apostate is indeed a general statement, as he is no longer considered a Jew in any sense. In accordance with the opinion of which <span class="it-text">tanna</span> did he make that statement? <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span>is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for whom Shabbat is as severe as idolatry, </span>and therefore one who desecrates Shabbat is treated like an idol worshipper. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the verse: “Speak to the children of Israel and say to them: When any man of you brings an offering to the Lord, you shall bring your offering of the cattle, of the herd, or of the flock” (Leviticus 1:2). The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> expounds: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Of you,” </span>i.e., some of you, but <span class="gemarra-regular">not all of you </span>may bring an offering – <span class="gemarra-regular">to the exclusion of an apostate. “Of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you” </span>additionally serves to emphasize that <span class="gemarra-regular">among you, </span>the children of Israel, <span class="gemarra-regular">I distinguish </span>between those who observe the Torah and are fit to bring an offering, and those who are not fit, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not among the nations, </span>i.e., in regard to the other nations, even those who do not fulfill the precepts binding upon them may offer their sacrifices. 
<span class="gemarra-regular"> “Of the cattle” </span>is expounded as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">To include people who are similar to animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in their disdain for the proper behavior of man, i.e., that the wicked too may offer sacrifices. <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">stated: We accept </span>voluntary <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrifices from Jewish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">transgressors</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in order </span>to enable them <span class="gemarra-regular">to repent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">apart from the apostate, one who pours wine libations </span>as part of idol worship, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who desecrates Shabbat in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">public, </span>from whom we do not accept sacrifices without their complete repentance.
The Gemara expresses surprise: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">itself is difficult, </span>i.e., it contains an internal contradiction: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">said: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Of you,” but not all of you, to the exclusion </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of an apostate; and then you taught: We accept sacrifices </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from Jewish transgressors. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is not difficult, </span>as it can be explained as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">The first clause </span>refers <span class="gemarra-regular">to an apostate with regard to the entire Torah, </span>whose sacrifices are not accepted, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">the middle clause </span>speaks <span class="gemarra-regular">of an apostate with regard to one matter </span>alone, whose sacrifices are indeed accepted.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>an explanation of <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause</span> of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apart from the apostate and one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pours wine libations </span>to idolatry, and one who desecrates Shabbat in public. <span class="gemarra-regular">This apostate, what are the circumstances </span>indicating his status? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">an apostate with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the entire Torah, this is </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first clause. </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">an apostate with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one thing, the middle clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>for it states that we accept sacrifices from such an apostate. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>true <span class="gemarra-regular">that this is </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is saying: Apart from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> apostate with regard to pouring wine libations </span>to idolatry <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> desecrating Shabbat in public? </span>Although they transgress only one matter, this transgression is so serious that they are considered apostates with regard to the entire Torah. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is apparent </span>from here that <span class="gemarra-regular">idolatry and Shabbat are equivalent, </span>which indicates that there is a <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who considers public Shabbat desecration as severe a transgression as idolatry. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from this </span>that it is so.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">If one of the residents of a courtyard forgot and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not participate in an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> with the other residents before Shabbat, and on Shabbat he renounced his rights in the courtyard to the other residents, <span class="gemarra-regular">his house is prohibited </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, </span>who forgot to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to them, </span>the other residents, <span class="gemarra-regular">to bring in </span>objects from the courtyard to his house <span class="gemarra-regular">or to take </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">out</span> from his house into the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">But their </span>houses <span class="gemarra-regular">are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">to him and to them, </span>for taking objects out into the courtyard and for bringing them in. <span class="gemarra-regular">If they gave </span>away <span class="gemarra-regular">their rights </span>in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him, </span>i.e., if they renounced their rights in his favor, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is permitted </span>to carry from his house into the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they are prohibited </span>from doing so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">If two</span> residents of the courtyard forgot to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, and the others renounced their rights in the courtyard in their favor, <span class="gemarra-regular">they prohibit one another. </span>In this scenario, the courtyard would belong to both of them, but each individual house remains the domain of its owner. It would therefore be prohibited for each of these residents to carry into the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">For one </span>resident <span class="gemarra-regular">may give away and receive </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rights </span>in a domain, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>residents <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">give </span><span class="gemarra-regular">away rights </span>in a domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they may not receive </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rights </span>in a domain. Since they did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, it is unreasonable for the other residents of the courtyard to give away their rights in the domain, as the two who are prohibited because they did not participate in the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> render it prohibited for each other to carry. 
The mishna poses a general question: <span class="gemarra-regular">When may one give </span>away <span class="gemarra-regular">rights </span>in a domain? <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: While it is still day, </span>i.e., before the onset of Shabbat; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Even after nightfall, </span>when it is already Shabbat. The mishna cites another dispute: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one gave away his rights</span> in his courtyard to the other residents of the courtyard, renouncing them after having forgotten to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with them the previous day, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he carried </span>something <span class="gemarra-regular">out</span> from his house into the courtyard – <span class="gemarra-regular">whether unwittingly, </span>forgetting that he had renounced his rights, <span class="gemarra-regular">or intentionally, he </span>renders carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for all the residents of the courtyard, for his action cancels his renunciation; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>If he acted <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, he </span>renders carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited; </span>but if he acted <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly, he does not</span> render carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara first analyzes the language of the mishna. It states: It is prohibited to bring in objects from the courtyard to his house and to take them out from his house into the courtyard. It can be inferred from this that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is carrying </span>to and from <span class="gemarra-regular">his house </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited, but carrying </span>to and from <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>share of the <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard is permitted </span>to the other residents of the courtyard. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>where this ruling applies? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the resident who forgot to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">renounced </span>his rights, <span class="gemarra-regular">why is his house </span>rendered <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited? </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">if he did not renounce </span>his rights, <span class="gemarra-regular">why is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his courtyard permitted? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dealing here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a special case, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he renounced his rights in his courtyard </span>to the others <span class="gemarra-regular">but did not renounce his rights in his house </span>to them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis hold that one who renounces his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rights in his courtyard has not renounced his rights in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his house, </span>as it is common <span class="gemarra-regular">for people to reside </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in a house without a courtyard.</span>
The Gemara proceeds in its analysis of the mishna: It states that carrying in and out of <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>houses <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and for them. </span>The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the reason </span>that their houses are permitted to him? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">For he is </span>regarded <span class="gemarra-regular">like a guest of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> theirs, </span>i.e., he is subordinate to them and may carry wherever they may do so.
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the other residents <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>away <span class="gemarra-regular">their rights </span>in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to carry from his house into the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they are prohibited </span>from doing so. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">let them, </span>the ones who renounced their rights in the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span>regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">guests of his, </span>which would enable them to carry as well. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">One vis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-à-vis five is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a guest, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>or more <span class="gemarra-regular">vis-à-vis one are not </span>ordinarily viewed as <span class="gemarra-regular">guests.</span>
The Gemara attempts to draw another inference from the wording of the mishna: Shall we not <span class="gemarra-regular">learn</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from this, </span>from the order of events in the mishna, that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may renounce </span>his rights in favor of another when he needs it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and then </span>the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">may renounce</span> his rights in favor of the former when he needs it? For the mishna first describes a case in which the one who forgot to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> renounces his rights in favor of the others, at which stage they may use the courtyard, and then afterward recounts that the other residents renounce their rights in favor of the one who forgot to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, leaving it permitted for him and prohibited for them. 
The Gemara answers: No proof can be brought from here, for <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: If they gave away</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their rights </span>in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">to him at the outset</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">him and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them. </span>In other words, this is not a continuation of the previous clause, but a separate case. 
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If two </span>residents of a courtyard forgot to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, and the others renounced their rights in the courtyard in their favor, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>render <span class="gemarra-regular">one another prohibited </span>from carrying. The Gemara raises a difficulty: Isn’t this <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? </span>What novel teaching is stated here? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No,</span> this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>in a case where the others renounced their rights in the courtyard in favor of the pair, and <span class="gemarra-regular">one of them then renounced </span>his rights <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> favor of the other. Lest you say let it </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">be permitted </span>for him to carry, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since at the time of his renunciation </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">not permitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> for him to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, </span>he may not renounce his rights either. Therefore, his renunciation is ineffective, and they are both prohibited from carrying.
The mishna explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">For one </span>resident <span class="gemarra-regular">may give away </span>and receive <span class="gemarra-regular">rights</span> in a domain. The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">this further </span>explanation? This ruling can be deduced from the previous cases: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the mishna wishes to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">giving </span>away rights, <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>that one person may give away his rights in a domain, and <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it wishes to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">receiving </span>rights, <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>it as well, so why the repetition?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He needed </span>it due to the ruling in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, </span>which includes the novel teaching that <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>residents <span class="gemarra-regular">may give away rights </span>in a domain. The Gemara again wonders: But <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> well, </span>that even multiple residents may give away their rights in a domain, is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious. </span>The Gemara answers: This was stated <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say:</span>

Daf 70a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Let us issue a decree </span>that two residents may not give away their rights in a domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to renounce </span>their rights <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor </span>of two residents as well. People might assume that just as two may give away their rights to one, so too may one give away his rights to two. The mishna therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that we do not issue such a decree.
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>two <span class="gemarra-regular">may not receive rights </span>in a domain. The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need to say this? Isn’t it superfluous? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach that rights may not be acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>the other residents of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>one of the two who did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Acquire </span>our rights in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> condition that you transfer </span>them in turn to your friend, the other one who did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. The mishna teaches that he does not become their agent and cannot transfer the rights to the other person, as he himself cannot receive such rights under these circumstances.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a dilemma before Rabba: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">live in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> same courtyard, and one of them forgot to join in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, when he renounces his rights </span>in the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">must he renounce </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of each and every</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>of the others <span class="gemarra-regular">or not? </span>Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: He must renounce </span>his rights <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of each and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> every one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">raised</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an objection </span>from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>resident of a courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may renounce his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rights </span>in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of one who did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Two </span>courtyard residents <span class="gemarra-regular">who established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce their rights </span>in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">favor of one who did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>courtyard residents <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">may renounce their rights </span>in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>residents <span class="gemarra-regular">who did establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or in favor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of one </span>resident <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But one </span>courtyard resident <span class="gemarra-regular">who did establish an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not renounce his rights </span>in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> favor of one </span>resident <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, nor may two </span>residents <span class="gemarra-regular">who established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> renounce their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rights </span>in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of two </span>other residents <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, nor may two </span>residents <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> renounce their rights </span>in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of two </span>residents <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">In any</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> event the first clause is teaching: One </span>resident of a courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may renounce his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rights </span>in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of one who did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. What are the circumstances </span>surrounding this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If there is no other </span>resident <span class="gemarra-regular">with him, </span>i.e., if there were only two people living in the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">with whom did he, </span>the other resident, <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>He could not have established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> on his own. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious that there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is another </span>resident <span class="gemarra-regular">with him, </span>apart from the one who failed to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">it states: </span>He may renounce his rights in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one who did establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which implies that it is enough for him to renounce his rights in favor of one of the residents. He does not have to renounce his rights in favor of all of them.
The Gemara now asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span>understand this teaching? The Gemara answers: Rabba can say as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>This is a special case, <span class="gemarra-regular">where there was </span>another person in the courtyard with whom he established the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>that person <span class="gemarra-regular">die</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in the meantime, leaving only one who established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, to whom the one who did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may renounce his rights.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it indeed refers to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there was </span>another person, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he died, say </span>an explanation for <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">But one </span>courtyard resident <span class="gemarra-regular">who did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not renounce his rights in favor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of one who did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Now if</span> it refers to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there was </span>at first another person <span class="gemarra-regular">but he died, why </span>may the one courtyard resident <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>renounce his rights in the courtyard? Now there is only one other person present in the courtyard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious that there is </span>another person present, with whom the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was established. <span class="gemarra-regular">And since the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> deals with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is </span>another person present, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> must also be dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is </span>another person present.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this</span> necessarily <span class="gemarra-regular">the designation in both </span>cases? Must the two clauses necessarily be dealing with the same case? <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is, and this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is, </span>i.e., each clause deals with a unique set of circumstances, which need not accord with each other.
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Know </span>that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> does not only deal with one state of affairs, <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the last </span>part <span class="gemarra-regular">of the first clause teaches: And two</span> courtyard residents <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may renounce</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their rights </span>in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of two </span>residents <span class="gemarra-regular">who did establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>It can be inferred from this that <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of two </span>residents, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>they may renounce their rights, but <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of one, no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>they may not. This clearly indicates that they must renounce their rights in the courtyard in favor of both of them. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Abaye </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say: What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of two</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? In favor of one of the two, </span>for this is as effective as renouncing their rights in favor of both of them. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it teach </span>that the two courtyard residents who did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may renounce their rights in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of one </span>resident <span class="gemarra-regular">who established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in favor of one </span>resident <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not establish an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>from which one would understand that there are two present, for otherwise there could be no <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. The Gemara concludes: This is indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult </span>according to Abaye’s opinion, although it does not completely refute his opinion. 
The Gemara now explains the need for each clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> opens: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>resident of a courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may renounce his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rights in favor of one who did establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> According to Abaye, </span>this refers <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>another person present, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it teaches us </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> need not renounce his rights </span>in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of each and every one </span>of the others. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabba, </span>this refers to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there was </span>another person in the courtyard, with whom he established the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>that person <span class="gemarra-regular">died </span>in the meantime, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the novel teaching is that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">did not issue a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>due to the concern that <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes </span>that other person <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">present.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Two </span>courtyard residents <span class="gemarra-regular">who established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may renounce their rights </span>in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of one who did not establish an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara poses a question: Isn’t this <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>What new <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is being taught here? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since he did not establish an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, we should penalize him </span>by insisting that he renounce his rights in their favor and not the reverse, therefore the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that it is permitted even for the ones who established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> to renounce their rights in his favor.
It was further taught in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>courtyard residents <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not establish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may renounce their rights </span>in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> favor of two </span>residents <span class="gemarra-regular">who established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. According </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabba, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught the latter clause to shed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">light on the first clause</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> As the latter clause teaches that one must renounce rights to every resident in the courtyard, the first clause must refer to the case where the additional resident passed away, for otherwise, he would not be able to renounce his rights to only one of the residents of the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Abaye, </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the mishna to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two who did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> For <span class="gemarra-regular">it could enter your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should issue a decree </span>determining that the two residents who did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may not renounce their rights in favor of the two residents who established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span>the two who established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">come to renounce</span> their rights <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of </span>the two who did not. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that we do not issue such a decree. 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>they may renounce their rights <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of one who did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need this addition? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">these</span> permissive <span class="gemarra-regular">rulings </span>with regard to renunciation <span class="gemarra-regular">apply only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where some of </span>the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> some of them did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. But </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where none of </span>the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, we should penalize them </span>by not allowing renunciation, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">category of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should not be forgotten </span>by those who come after them. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us</span> that we are not concerned about this.
We further learned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">But one </span>courtyard resident <span class="gemarra-regular">who did establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not renounce his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rights </span>in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of one who did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. According to Abaye, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause to shed light on the first clause,</span> for Abaye proves from here that a person may renounce his rights to one of the two courtyard residents, and need not renounce his rights to both of them. <span class="gemarra-regular">According</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Rabba, since </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught the first clause </span>in a certain style, <span class="gemarra-regular">it also taught the latter clause </span>in that same style, but no halakhic conclusion can be garnered from here.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> further states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Nor may two </span>residents <span class="gemarra-regular">who established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> renounce their rights </span>in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>other residents <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">this further </span>matter? Isn’t this statement superfluous? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No,</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one of </span>the two who did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">renounced </span>his rights <span class="gemarra-regular">in favor of his fellow </span>resident. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it should </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">be permitted </span>to carry, as there is only one person left who has any rights in the courtyard and failed to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, therefore it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since at the time of his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">renunciation he was not permitted in that courtyard, </span>he may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>renounce his rights in it, and therefore carrying is prohibited for both. 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Nor may two </span>residents <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> renounce their rights </span>in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">favor of two </span>residents <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara poses the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">additional </span>matter? Isn’t it superfluous? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No,</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the other courtyard residents <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to one of the first two who did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Acquire </span>our rights in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">on condition that you transfer </span>them in turn to your friend, the other one who did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. They attempted to appoint one of them as an agent to transfer the collective rights to the other. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches us that this method is ineffective. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a dilemma before Rav Naḥman: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an heir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> regarding whether <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce rights</span> in a courtyard? If a person who had forgotten to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> died on Shabbat, may his heir renounce his rights in his stead? 

Daf 70b

The Gemara explains the two sides of the question: On the one hand, perhaps only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where, if </span>the person <span class="gemarra-regular">wanted to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the previous day he could have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he can also </span>renounce his rights on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">But this </span>heir, <span class="gemarra-regular">since, if he wanted to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the previous day he could not have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as he was not then a resident of the courtyard, therefore, today <span class="gemarra-regular">he cannot renounce </span>his rights either.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> perhaps an heir is </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">his father’s foot, </span>i.e., he is considered an extension of his father and substitutes for him in all regards, which means that just as his father could have renounced his rights, so can he.
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I </span>myself <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that an heir <span class="gemarra-regular">can </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce </span>rights in a courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">while those</span> scholars of <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Shmuel taught: He cannot </span><span class="gemarra-regular">renounce </span>rights in a courtyard. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to</span> Rav Naḥman from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">principle: Anything that is permitted for part of Shabbat is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted for all of Shabbat, and anything that is prohibited </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for part of Shabbat is prohibited for all of Shabbat, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">apart from one who renounces his rights </span>in a courtyard, for renunciation can provide an allowance halfway through Shabbat. 
The Gemara now explains each element of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Anything that is permitted for part of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shabbat is permitted for all of Shabbat. For example, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was established </span>between two adjacent courtyards that are connected <span class="gemarra-regular">via an opening </span>between them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">opening was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> closed up </span>on Shabbat, the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is valid. Alternately, if <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was established </span>between the two courtyards that are connected <span class="gemarra-regular">via a window </span>opening from one to the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">window was closed up </span>on Shabbat, the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is valid. As carrying from one courtyard to another was permitted at the beginning of Shabbat, it is permitted throughout Shabbat. 
The Gemara comments: The words <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the principle </span>come <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway whose </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beams</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or side posts were removed </span>on Shabbat, teaching that one may nonetheless use the alleyway, as it had been permitted at the outset of Shabbat. 
The Gemara continues its explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Anything that is prohibited for part </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Shabbat is prohibited for all of Shabbat. For example, </span>if there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two houses on two sides of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">public domain, which gentiles enclosed with a wall on Shabbat, </span>the enclosed area remains prohibited. Even though a partition of this kind is considered a proper one with regard to Shabbat domains, it is prohibited to carry objects from either house into the enclosed area, even if the owner of the first house renounces his rights in the area in favor of the owner of the second house, as they could not have established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> between them before Shabbat.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>do the words <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the principle </span>come <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>in this part of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? The Gemara answers: It comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gentile </span>resident of the courtyard who <span class="gemarra-regular">died on Shabbat </span>without having rented out his domain to a Jew for the purpose of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. In this case, the Jewish neighbors are prohibited from carrying in the courtyard. Because it was prohibited to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> the previous day, carrying in the courtyard continues to be prohibited on Shabbat, even though the gentile is now deceased.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: Apart from one who renounces his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rights </span>in a courtyard, which teaches that a person may renounce his rights in a courtyard even on Shabbat, despite the fact that the courtyard was prohibited prior to his renunciation. The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>himself, i.e., the original owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>he may renounce his rights even on Shabbat, but with regard to his <span class="gemarra-regular">heir, no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he may not renounce his rights on Shabbat, which contradicts Rav Naḥman’s opinion.
Rav Naḥman replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> must be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apart from </span>anyone who falls <span class="gemarra-regular">into the </span>halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">category of one who renounces his rights </span>in a domain. In other words, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is not referring to a particular person who renounces his rights, but rather to the category of renunciation in general, which includes an heir. 
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">raised a </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">objection </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of Rav Naḥman from a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a resident of a courtyard died and left his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domain, </span>the use of his house, <span class="gemarra-regular">to one from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">marketplace, </span>i.e., a non-resident of the courtyard, the following distinction applies: If he died <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day, </span>i.e., before Shabbat, the one from the marketplace renders carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, </span>for it is assumed that he received his portion before the onset of Shabbat and should have joined in an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with the others. Since he failed to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with the other residents of the courtyard, he renders carrying prohibited in the entire courtyard. If, however, he died <span class="gemarra-regular">after nightfall, he does not </span>render carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, </span>for so long as it was permitted to carry for part of Shabbat it remains permitted for the entirety of Shabbat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>alternatively, if <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from the marketplace </span>who owned a residence in the courtyard but did not dwell there <span class="gemarra-regular">died and left his domain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to a resident of the courtyard </span>who does live there and usually joins in an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with his neighbors, the following distinction applies: If the person from the marketplace died <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day, </span>i.e., before Shabbat, the courtyard resident <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>render carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, </span>as when he establishes his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> it includes his new residence as well. If, however, the person from the marketplace died <span class="gemarra-regular">after nightfall</span> without having established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, the deceased renders carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>As this residence was prohibited at the beginning of Shabbat, it can no longer be permitted on that Shabbat. 
Rava’s question is based on the first case discussed in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: According to Rav Naḥman, <span class="gemarra-regular">why does</span> the heir render carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>in this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> renounce </span>his rights in the courtyard to the other residents, as Rav Naḥman maintains that an heir may renounce rights. Rav Naḥman replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of the word <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibits that </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>here? It means he renders carrying prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">until he renounces </span>his rights, i.e., although there is no way of rectifying the situation by means of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, it can be corrected by way of renunciation.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a different proof challenging Rav Naḥman’s opinion, from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew and a convert were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">living in a single residenc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> comprised of several rooms, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the convert died </span>childless <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day, </span>such a convert has no heirs, and therefore the first to take possession of his property acquires it. 

Daf 71a

In such a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though a different Jew took</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> possession of </span>the convert’s <span class="gemarra-regular">property, </span>the one who acquires it renders carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>If, however, he died <span class="gemarra-regular">after nightfall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, even though a different Jew did not take possession of</span> his property, <span class="gemarra-regular">it, </span>i.e., carrying, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not prohibited, </span>for carrying had already been permitted on that Shabbat. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">itself is difficult. You </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>If the convert died <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day, even though a different </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Jew took possession of </span>his property, the latter renders carrying prohibited, which implies that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not necessary </span>to say so <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>another Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">did not take possession of </span>the property, for in such a case it is certainly prohibited. But this is incorrect. <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>a different person <span class="gemarra-regular">did not take possession of </span>the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">not prohibited, </span>for in such a case the convert’s property is ownerless and there is nobody to render carrying in the courtyard prohibited.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should read as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even though </span>a different Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">did not take possession </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>it. The Gemara raises a difficulty: How can it be corrected in this manner? <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t it teach</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Even though he took possession of </span>it?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>If the convert died while it was still day, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even though </span>a different Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">did not take possession of </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day but </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">after nightfall, since </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he had </span>the possibility <span class="gemarra-regular">of taking possession </span>of it <span class="gemarra-regular">while </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was still day, </span>the person who acquires it renders carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>If, however, the convert died <span class="gemarra-regular">after nightfall, even</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> though a different Jew did not take possession of </span>his property, <span class="gemarra-regular">it does not render </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to carry.
The Gemara now considers the next clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states: If the convert died after nightfall, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> different Jew did not take possession of </span>his property, carrying is not prohibited. This implies that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not necessary</span> to say so <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>another Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">did take possession of</span> the property, for in such a case it is certainly not prohibited. But, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the contrary, where </span>a different person <span class="gemarra-regular">takes possession of </span>the property, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>renders carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should read as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even though </span>a different Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span><span class="gemarra-regular">possession of </span>it. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: Even though he did not take</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> possession of </span>it? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>If the convert died after nightfall, <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> though </span>a different Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">took possession of </span>his property <span class="gemarra-regular">after</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nightfall, since he did not have </span>the possibility <span class="gemarra-regular">of taking</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> possession </span>of it <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day, he does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>render carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
After explaining the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the Gemara proceeds to clarify the issue at hand: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any event, the first clause is teaching </span>that the person who acquires the convert’s property <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited; </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">why does he render </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited? Let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him renounce </span>his rights in the domain like an heir. The implication then is that he does not have the option of renunciation, in contrast to the opinion of Rav Naḥman. 
Rav Naḥman replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of the word <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibits </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that it teaches </span>here? It means he renders carrying prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">until he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">renounces</span> his rights, but renunciation is effective.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Who is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the </span>problematic <span class="gemarra-italic">baraitot</span> that imply that an heir cannot renounce rights, and from which objections were brought against Rav Naḥman? <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is Beit Shammai, who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no renunciation </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of rights on Shabbat </span>at all, even for the owner of the property. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may one give away rights </span>in a domain? <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: While it is still day. And Beit Hillel say: </span>Even <span class="gemarra-regular">after nightfall.</span>
With regard to this dispute itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said: What is the reason </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Beit Hille</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> that one may renounce rights even after nightfall? This should be considered an act of acquisition, which is prohibited on Shabbat. He explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is comparable to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one who says: Turn toward the high-quality ones</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If a person sets aside <span class="it-text">teruma</span> from another person’s produce without the latter’s knowledge, and when the owner finds out he says: Why did you set aside this produce? Turn toward the high-quality ones, i.e., you should have gone to find better produce to use as <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, then the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> that was separated is considered <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, provided there was indeed quality produce in that place. The reason is that the owner has demonstrated his retroactive acquiescence to the other person’s setting aside of <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. Therefore, the latter is considered his agent for this purpose. The same applies to our issue. If a person intended to permit both himself and others to carry in a courtyard by means of establishing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> but forgot to do so, by renouncing his rights after nightfall, he retroactively makes plain his desire that his domain should be mingled with that of his neighbors. What he then does on Shabbat is not a complete action, but merely a demonstration of his intentions.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>This explanation is unsatisfactory, as when <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentile dies on Shabbat, what </span>connection <span class="gemarra-regular">is there to </span>the concept: <span class="gemarra-regular">Turn toward the high-quality ones? </span>When a gentile dies on Shabbat, his Jewish neighbors may renounce their rights in the courtyard to each other and thus render carrying in the courtyard permitted, even though such renunciation would have been ineffective prior to his passing. Consequently, it cannot be said that it works retroactively. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Gemara rejects Ulla’s explanation and states that <span class="gemarra-regular">here they disagree</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> over the following: Beit Shammai hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">renunciation of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> domain is </span>equivalent to <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition of a domain, and acquisition</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a domain is prohibited on Shabbat. And Beit Hillel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is merely withdrawal from a domain, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> withdrawal from a domain seems well on Shabbat, </span>i.e., it is permitted. As such, there is no reason to prohibit renunciation as a form of acquisition, which is prohibited as a part of a decree against conducting commerce on Shabbat.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">a homeowner was in partnership with his neighbors, with this</span> one <span class="gemarra-regular">in wine and with that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">they need not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>for due to their authentic partnership they are considered to be one household, and no further partnership is required. 
If, however, he was in partnership <span class="gemarra-regular">with this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wine and with that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">in oil, they must establish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>As they are not partners in the same item, they are not all considered one partnership. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">both this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>case, i.e., even if he partners with his neighbors in different items, <span class="gemarra-regular">they need not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one who is in partnership in wine with both his neighbors need not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> applies only if their wine is <span class="gemarra-regular">in one vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rava said: </span>The language of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it teaches: </span>If he was in partnership <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this one in wine and with the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">one in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">oil, they must establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Granted, if you say</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the mishna deals <span class="gemarra-regular">with one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> vessel, and the latter clause </span>deals <span class="gemarra-regular">with two vessels, </span>one of wine and one of oil, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is well. But</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the mishna speaks <span class="gemarra-regular">of two vessels, and the latter clause </span>also speaks <span class="gemarra-regular">of two vessels, what </span>difference is it <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">wine and wine or wine and oil? </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> should be the same in both cases.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: </span>This is no proof, and the first clause can be referring to a case where the wine was in separate vessels as well. The difference is that <span class="gemarra-regular">wine and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wine is suitable for mixing </span>together, and therefore can be considered a single unit even if divided into two containers. <span class="gemarra-regular">Wine and oil, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">are not suitable for mixing. </span>
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">both this </span>case, where they are partners in wine alone, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>case, where the partnerships are in wine and oil, <span class="gemarra-regular">they need not establish an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara poses a question: Did he say this <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>the partnership is <span class="gemarra-regular">with this one in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wine and with the other one in oil? </span>But these are not suitable for mixing. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: With what are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we dealing here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with a courtyard </span>positioned <span class="gemarra-regular">between two alleyways, and Rabbi Shimon </span>follows <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>usual line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon said: To what is this matter comparable? </span>It is comparable <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">three courtyards that open </span><span class="gemarra-regular">into one another and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">open into a public domain. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If the two outer </span>courtyards each <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the middle one, it is permitted </span>for residents of the middle one to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the two outer ones, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted </span>for residents of the two outer ones to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the middle one. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, it is prohibited </span>for the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the two outer </span>courtyards to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">with each other, </span>as they did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with each other. This teaches that the residents of one courtyard can establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with a courtyard on each side, and need not choose between them. Here too, the residents of the courtyard can participate in an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with both alleyways, one by means of wine and the other by means of oil.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: Are </span>the cases really <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable? There it teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: It is prohibited </span>for the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the two outer</span> courtyards to carry with each other, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here it teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: They need not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>indicating that it is permitted for residents of all three domains to carry with each other.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the subject of the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">they need not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It refers to the <span class="gemarra-regular">neighbors together with the homeowner, </span>i.e., the residents of the courtyards that open into each of the alleyways with the resident of the courtyard in the middle. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the neighbors with each other, </span>i.e., if the residents of the two alleyways wish to be permitted to carry with each other, <span class="gemarra-regular">they must establish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> and place it in the middle courtyard. 

Daf 71b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yosef said: </span>In fact we are dealing here with a single alleyway, and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon and the Rabbis disagree about the </span>same point of <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri and the Rabbis. As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we learned </span>in a mishna: If <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">oil was floating</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the surface of wine, and one who immersed during</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> touched the oil, he disqualified only the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> oil alone. </span>However, he did not disqualify the wine, because it is considered separate from the oil. Only the oil is disqualified, and it does not render other items ritually impure. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says: They are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> both connected to each other </span>and are considered as one, so the wine is also ritually impure. 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>opinion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis </span>in our mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>in the other mishna, who maintain that wine and oil are not connected and therefore cannot be used together in an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, </span>who holds that wine and oil are connected, and may be used together in an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Eliezer ben Taddai says: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">both this </span>case, of wine and wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>case, of wine and oil, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">must establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara expresses wonder: Did he say this <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the partnership is <span class="gemarra-regular">with this one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in wine and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">with the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">one in wine? </span>Why should these partnerships not be sufficient to consider the items merged?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>If they partnered in the following manner, such that <span class="gemarra-regular">this one came with his </span>wine-filled <span class="gemarra-regular">jug and poured </span>its contents into a barrel, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">one came with his jug and poured </span>his wine into that same barrel, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees that it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>even if they did not act specifically for that purpose. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree </span>is in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they bought a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">barrel of wine in partnership. Rabbi Eliezer ben Taddai holds: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">There is no </span>principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">retroactive clarification, </span>i.e., there is no halakhic assumption that the undetermined halakhic status of items can be retroactively clarified. Consequently, after the wine is consumed, it is not possible to clarify retroactively which portion of the wine belonged to each person. Therefore, they cannot each be said to own a particular part of the wine, which renders it unfit for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis hold that there is retroactive clarification, </span>and therefore they may rely on this partnership to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said </span>that this dispute should be understood differently, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Taddai and the Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disagree about</span> whether one may <span class="gemarra-regular">rely on a merging </span>of an alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">instead of an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., whether the merging of an alleyway to permit carrying in the alleyway, exempts the courtyards that open into the alleyway from having to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the purpose of carrying from one courtyard to the other.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Eliezer ben Taddai, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that one <span class="gemarra-regular">may not rely </span>on it in that case, as carrying in the courtyards requires specifically an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, and the merging of alleyways is insufficient. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>i.e., the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that one <span class="gemarra-regular">may rely </span>on and use the merging of alleyways to permit carrying between the courtyards as well.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: From where do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I say this, </span>that this is the subject of their dispute? <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>which will be detailed later, that one may not rely on a merging of alleyways instead of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Beruna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Taddai, </span>that in both cases they must establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the reason </span>he ruled in this manner? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not because the rationale </span>for both rulings is <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>and the same?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if it is one reason, why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rulings? </span>On the contrary, it would be enough to rule in one case, from which we could infer the other as well. Rav Yosef replied: There is nevertheless a reason for both rulings, as <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>comes to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach us that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we do not act in accordance with two stringencies </span>of one <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>matters of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Had Rav ruled only in accordance with Rabbi Meir, we would have known only that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with his opinion with regard to one specific detail of the case. He therefore ruled in accordance with two Sages: Rabbi Eliezer ben Taddai with regard to a merging of alleyways with wine, and Rabbi Meir with regard to a merging of alleyways with bread. Each is stringent with regard to a different detail of the case.
Having mentioned Rabbi Meir, the Gemara now asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, and what</span> is the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis? As it was taught</span> in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bread between courtyards </span>that open to one another, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one wanted to establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with wine, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> in that manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">merge </span>the courtyards that open <span class="gemarra-regular">into an alleyway with wine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and if one wanted to establish a merging </span>of alleyways <span class="gemarra-regular">with bread, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">merge </span>the courtyards of alleyways in this manner. 
Why <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> between courtyards and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">merge </span>the courtyards that open <span class="gemarra-regular">into an alleyway? </span>It is so <span class="gemarra-regular">as not to cause the </span>halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">category of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to be forgotten by the children, as </span>if a merging of alleyways alone were used, the children would later <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Our fathers never established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Therefore, an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is established for educational purposes; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And the Rabbis say: </span>One may <span class="gemarra-regular">either establish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or merge </span>alleyways.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Naḥumi and Rabba disagreed about </span>this issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>In the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of bread, </span>which may be used both for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> and for a merging of alleyways, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees that one, </span>either an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> or a merging of alleyways, <span class="gemarra-regular">is enough. When they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disagree </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of wine, </span>which may be used only for a merging of alleyways but not for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, Rabbi Meir maintains that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is also necessary, while the Rabbis maintain that it is not required. 

Daf 72a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>In the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of wine, everyone agrees that two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are required, </span>both a merging of alleyways and a joining of courtyards. <span class="gemarra-regular">When they disagree </span>is in a case where an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was established <span class="gemarra-regular">with bread: </span>Rabbi Meir maintains that both a merging of alleyways and a joining of courtyards are required, whereas the Rabbis say that one is sufficient. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>One may <span class="gemarra-regular">either establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a merging </span>of alleyways. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span>does it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>mean that one <span class="gemarra-regular">either </span><span class="gemarra-regular">establishes an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the courtyard with bread or a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">merging in the alleyway with wine, </span>which indicates that they also disagreed in a case where a merging of alleyways was established with wine? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Giddel said that Rav said </span>that the Rabbis were <span class="gemarra-regular">saying as follows: </span>One may <span class="gemarra-regular">either establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in the courtyard with bread, and </span>it would <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span>rendered <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to carry both <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there, </span>in the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish a merging </span>of alleyways <span class="gemarra-regular">in the alleyway with bread, and </span>it would <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span>rendered <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to carry both <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the alleyway.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Huna said: </span>No clear halakhic ruling was issued in his favor, but <span class="gemarra-regular">the custom is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir. </span>Therefore, if someone asks, he should be instructed to act accordingly. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>It is not even a custom established by the Sages. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">the people were accustome</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to act <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>and we do not tell them they have acted inappropriately. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">five groups </span>of people <span class="gemarra-regular">who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spent Shabbat in one hall [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">teraklin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> that was subdivided by partitions into separate rooms, each of which had a separate entrance to a courtyard that was shared with other houses, <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: An </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> is required <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> each and every group, </span>i.e., each group must contribute separately to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> of the courtyard, as each is considered a different house. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: One </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> suffices <span class="gemarra-regular">for all of them, </span>as the partitions do not render the different sections separate houses. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">concede </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when some of them occupy </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">rooms or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upper stories, they require </span>a separate <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for each and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> every group, </span>and the fact that they are in the same building does not render them one unified group. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>applies only where they divided the hall <span class="gemarra-regular">with a partition of pegs</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mesifas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">].</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if they divided it <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a sturdy <span class="gemarra-regular">partition ten </span>handbreadths high, <span class="gemarra-regular">all agree </span>that a separate contribution to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> is required <span class="gemarra-regular">for each and every</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> group, </span>as this certainly divides the hall into separate living quarters. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>a different version of the previous passage, according to which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>where they merely divided the room <span class="gemarra-regular">with a partition of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pegs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> there is a <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>about whether this is considered a full-fledged partition. 
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">disagreed about </span>this issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is with regard to partitions that reach the ceiling, but </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions that do not reach the ceiling, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all agree </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> suffices <span class="gemarra-regular">for all of them, </span>as the partitions do not turn the compartments into separate houses. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one said: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute is with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">partitions that do not reach the ceiling, but </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions that reach the ceiling, all agree </span>that the compartments are considered separate living quarters, and <span class="gemarra-regular">they require </span>a separate contribution to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for each and every group. </span>

Daf 72b

The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>based on the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda the Keen </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">hasabbar</span>], who was known by this name due to his sharp mind, <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">disagree about partitions that reach the ceiling, as </span>all agree that <span class="gemarra-regular">they require </span>a separate contribution to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">each and every group. With regard to what did they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions that do not reach the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ceiling, as Beit Shammai say: </span>A separate contribution to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> is required <span class="gemarra-regular">for each and every group, and Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Hillel say: One </span>contribution to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> suffices <span class="gemarra-regular">for all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of them.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">According to the one who said </span>that it was with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions that reach the ceiling </span>that there was a <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute, </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> offers a <span class="gemarra-regular">conclusive </span><span class="gemarra-regular">refutation. And according to the one who said </span>that it was with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions that do not reach the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ceiling </span>that there was a <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> offers <span class="gemarra-regular">support. </span>With regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to that version </span>which holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>applies only where they divided the hall <span class="gemarra-regular">with a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mesifas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation. </span>
However, the following issue needs further clarification: With regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that version </span>which holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>where the hall was divided <span class="gemarra-regular">with a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mesifas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, shall we say </span>that Rabbi Yehuda the Keen’s statement <span class="gemarra-regular">is a </span>conclusive <span class="gemarra-regular">refutation? </span>That is to say, does it imply that all agree that in the case of a <span class="it-text">mesifas</span>, one <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> suffices for them all?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman</span> could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: They </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">disagreed about a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> partition, and the same is true of a partition of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pegs. And </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that they disagree with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to a partition </span>rather than a partition of pegs is <span class="gemarra-regular">to convey to you the far-reaching nature of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel. </span>Even where the compartments are divided by full-fledged partitions, Beit Hillel remain of the opinion that one contribution to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> suffices for all of them, as the partitions do not turn them into separate residences.
The Gemara asks: If they disagreed in both cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">let them disagree </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">about a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mesifas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">inform you of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">strength of Beit Shammai. </span>They are stringent and require a separate contribution to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for each and every group, even in the case of a <span class="it-text">mesifas</span>. The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">preferable </span>for the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> to teach us <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> strength of a permissive </span>ruling. If a <span class="it-text">tanna</span> can formulate a dispute in a manner that emphasizes the strength of the more lenient position, he will do so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman said that Rav said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda the Keen, </span>that all agree that where the partitions reach the ceiling, a separate contribution to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is required for each group, and that they disagree only about partitions that do not reach the ceiling. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: The mishna is also precise </span>according to this view, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it teaches: And </span>Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">concede </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when some</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of them occupy </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">rooms or upper stories, they require</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span>separate <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for each and every group. What </span>is the meaning of the word <span class="gemarra-regular">rooms, and what </span>is the meaning of the term <span class="gemarra-regular">upper stories? If you say </span>that the word <span class="gemarra-regular">rooms </span>refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">actual rooms and </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">upper stories </span>refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">actual upper stories, </span>i.e., they were separate from the beginning and are not subdivisions of a larger room, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious, </span>as this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing the case of many people residing in the same courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, doesn’t it </span>mean that they are <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to rooms and similar to upper stories? And what</span> are <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>partitions? They are <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions that reach the ceiling</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>and even though they are not actual rooms or upper stories, they are considered like rooms and upper stories. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from this </span>that this is the case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case is <span class="gemarra-regular">this statement, </span>that Beit Shammai require a separate contribution to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> from each group, <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the groups in the hall <span class="gemarra-regular">bring their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> elsewher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in the courtyard, i.e., to a different house. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was coming to them, </span>i.e., if the other members of the courtyard brought their contributions and established the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in that hall, <span class="gemarra-regular">all agree</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>contribution to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> suffices <span class="gemarra-regular">for all of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them. </span>The fact that the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is placed in this house renders all of its residents members of a single unit.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span>in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>live in the same courtyard and <span class="gemarra-regular">collected their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when they take their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> elsewhere </span>in the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>contribution to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> suffices <span class="gemarra-regular">for all of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them. In accordance with whose </span>opinion is this ruling? <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>a different version of the previous passage: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case is <span class="gemarra-regular">this statement, </span>that Beit Hillel require only one contribution for all the groups together, <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was coming </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to them. But if </span>the groups in the hall <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bringing their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> elsewhere </span>in the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">all agree </span>that a separate contribution to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is required for each </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and every one of them.</span>
If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">that was taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>live in the same courtyard and <span class="gemarra-regular">collected </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, when they take their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> elsewhere </span>in the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>contribution to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> suffices <span class="gemarra-regular">for all of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them. In accordance with whose </span>opinion is this ruling? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>either <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of them. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers who were eating at their father</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s table and sleeping in their </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">houses </span>in the same courtyard, a separate contribution to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is required</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for each and every one </span>of them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one of them forgot and did not </span>contribute to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce his rights </span>in the courtyard in order to render carrying in the courtyard permitted to the rest of the courtyard’s residents. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>do they state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? They state it <span class="gemarra-regular">when they take their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> elsewhere</span> in the courtyard, i.e., to the house of one of the other residents. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was coming</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to them, </span>i.e., if it was placed in their father’s house, <span class="gemarra-regular">or if there are no </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">residents</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the brothers and their father <span class="gemarra-regular">in the courtyard, they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not required to establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as they are considered like a single individual living in a courtyard.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments on the statement in the mishna that a separate contribution to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> must be made by each of the brothers if they sleep in their own houses: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from it </span>that one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">place of sleep determines </span>the location of his residence. The Gemara rejects this conclusion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">They taught </span>this mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>brothers who <span class="gemarra-regular">receive </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">portio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> from their father. The mishna is not referring to brothers who actually eat at their father’s table, but rather to brothers whose father supplies them with food that they eat in their own homes.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who has a gatehouse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> porch</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">balcony in his friend’s courtyard does not render</span> the owner of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from carrying there without an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, as these locations are not considered residences. However, if he has a <span class="gemarra-regular">storeroom of straw, a cattle shed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, a woodshed, or a storehouse </span>in his friend’s courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">he renders it prohibit </span>for his friend to carry there without an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: Only a place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>actual <span class="gemarra-regular">dwelling renders </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, </span>but a building that is not designated for residence does not render carrying without an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> prohibited for another resident of the courtyard. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: There was an incident with ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Nappaḥa, who had </span>houses in <span class="gemarra-regular">five courtyards in Usha, </span>only one of which served as his own residence. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">case came before the Sages </span>to decide whether an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> must be made for all of them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Only a house of residence renders </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited.</span>
The Gemara expresses surprise at the wording of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does it enter your mind </span>that the correct reading is <span class="gemarra-regular">a house of residence? </span>He has a house in each of the five courtyards. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say: A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place of residence, </span>i.e., it is prohibited to carry in the place where he actually lives, but nowhere else.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>considered one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">place of residence? Rav said: </span>

Daf 73a

<span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> place </span>where he eats his <span class="gemarra-regular">bread</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Shmuel said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>His <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">sleep</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection</span> to Rav’s opinion from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">shepherds; fig watchmen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who guard figs spread out in the field; <span class="gemarra-regular">guardsmen </span>who sit in small guardhouses; <span class="gemarra-regular">and produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> watchmen; when they customarily sleep in the city </span>in addition to eating there, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are like the residents of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> city </span>with regard to their Shabbat limit, even though they were in the field when Shabbat began. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">when they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> customarily sleep in the field, </span>even though they eat in the town, <span class="gemarra-regular">they have </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">two thousand </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">in each</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> direction </span>from the places where they sleep. This seems to contradict the opinion of Rav, who maintains that a person’s place of dwelling is determined by where he eats, not by where he sleeps. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of the people in the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are witnesses, </span>i.e., it is clearly evident, <span class="gemarra-regular">that if </span>people would <span class="gemarra-regular">bring them bread there, </span>to the place where they sleep, <span class="gemarra-regular">it would be more convenient for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them. </span>Fundamentally, however, a person’s dwelling place is determined by where he eats, rather than where he sleeps. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: I have not heard this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> stated by Rav. An illness had caused Rav Yosef to forget his studies. His student, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye, said to him: You </span>yourself <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it to us, and it was with regard to this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that you said it to us: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who were eating at their father’s table and sleeping </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in their </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">houses </span>in the same courtyard, a separate contribution to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is required for each and every </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we said to you: </span>Can one <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from </span>here that a person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">place of sleep </span><span class="gemarra-regular">determines </span>the location of his Shabbat residence? <span class="gemarra-regular">And you said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to us in this regard </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: They taught </span>this mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>brothers <span class="gemarra-regular">who receive a portion </span>from their father and are therefore considered as though they eat at his table, whereas in actual fact they eat their meals in their own homes.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who has five wives </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">receive a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> portion from their husband </span>while each living in her own quarters in the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and five slaves </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">receive a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> portion from their maste</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> while living in their own lodgings in the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira permits in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the wives, </span>i.e., they do not each have to contribute separately to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, as they are all considered to be residing with their husband. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he prohibits in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the slaves, </span>meaning that he holds that as they live in separate houses, each is considered as residing on his own. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permits in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the slaves, </span>as a slave necessarily follows his master, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he prohibits in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the wives, </span>as each woman is significant in her own right, and is not totally dependent on her husband. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: What is the rationale </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava? As it is written: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">But Daniel was in the gate of the king” </span>(Daniel 2:49). The verse refers to Daniel’s function rather than to an actual location, indicating that wherever Daniel went, it was as though he was in the king’s gate. The same applies to any slave vis-à-vis his master.
The Gemara proceeds to clarify various aspects of this issue, starting with a summary of what has already been stated. The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a son with his father, as we stated </span>it above the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">A wife with her husband and a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> slave with his master </span>are subject to the <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira and Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava. </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a student </span>who lives <span class="gemarra-regular">with his master </span>in the same courtyard and receives his sustenance from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span> is his status with regard to <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to this question: <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav, </span>when he was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the school of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥiyya, said: We do not need to establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as we are dependent upon the table of Rabbi Ḥiyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya </span>himself, when he was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> school of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">said: We do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">need to establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as we are dependent upon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the table of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma before Rabba: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>live in the same courtyard and <span class="gemarra-regular">collected their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, when they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> take their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> elsewhere </span>in order to merge their courtyard with a different one, is <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>contribution to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">for all of them, or do they need </span>a separate contribution to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for each and every one</span> of them? Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: One </span>contribution to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> suffices <span class="gemarra-regular">for all of them. </span>
Abaye asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who are comparable </span>to people <span class="gemarra-regular">who collected </span>their <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, the mishna nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: They require a </span>separate <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for each</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and every one </span>of them. Rabba responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">residents, </span>in addition to the father and his sons, living <span class="gemarra-regular">with them. </span>In that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these </span>additional residents <span class="gemarra-regular">render </span>carrying in the same courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited</span> unless they join in an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>brothers <span class="gemarra-regular">also render</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it prohibited </span>for one another to carry in the other courtyard unless each of them contributes to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is reasonable </span>to understand, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: When </span>do they state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">When they bring their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> elsewhere</span> in the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was coming to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them, or if there are no </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">residents with them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the courtyard, they do not need to establish an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as they are considered like a single individual living in a courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from this </span>that the preceding ruling refers to a situation where they shared the courtyard with other residents. 
The Gemara addresses a similar issue with regard to a joining of Shabbat boundaries: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin raised a dilemma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Rav Sheshet: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">students in their master</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s house who eat </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">bread in </span>their houses <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the field [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">baga</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">come and sleep in</span> their <span class="gemarra-regular">master’s house, when we measure </span>their Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for them, do we measure </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for them from </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">master’s house, </span>where they sleep, <span class="gemarra-regular">or do we measure</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">for them from the field, </span>where they eat? <span class="gemarra-regular">He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to him: We measure </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">master’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who deposits his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which establishes the location of his meal, <span class="gemarra-regular">within two thousand cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">goes </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">and sleeps in his house, we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> measure his </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit from his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This implies that the determining factor is where he eats, rather than where he sleeps. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">In that </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">we are witnesses, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">we are witnesses, </span>i.e., in both cases the person’s intentions regarding his place of residence are clearly evident. <span class="gemarra-regular">In that </span>case, where the person deposits his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are witnesses that if he </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">reside</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there, </span>at the site of his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">it would be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> better for him, </span>i.e., if he could spend the night there he would do so, since he wishes to continue from that place onward on the following day. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in this </span>case of the students in their master’s house, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are witnesses that if </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">would bring them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bread in their master’s house, </span>enabling them to eat there, <span class="gemarra-regular">it would be better for them. </span>Consequently, it is considered their place of residence.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥama raised a dilemma before Rav Ḥisda: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a father and his son, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">a master and his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> student, are they considered as many </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">or as individuals</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The practical import of the question is as follows: If they lived together in a courtyard that was within another courtyard, are they considered as many people, who <span class="gemarra-regular">require an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> in order to render it permitted to carry in the outer courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">or do they not require an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as they are treated as an individual, who does not render carrying in the outer courtyard prohibited? Is <span class="gemarra-regular">their alleyway </span>rendered <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">through a side post </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, </span>like one that has multiple residents, <span class="gemarra-regular">or is it not </span>rendered <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">through a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">side post and </span>a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam?</span>
Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You have </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned this </span>in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a father and his so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">a master and his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> student, when there are no </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">residents with them, they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like individuals, and they do not need to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and their alleyway </span>becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">through a side post and </span>a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>without a merging of alleyways.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">open into one another and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">open into an alleyway,</span> the following distinctions apply: If the residents of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">merge the </span>courtyards that open into the <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway, they are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">in the courtyards and they are prohibited </span>to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">in the alleyway. </span>The <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> they established cannot also serve as a merging of the courtyards that open into the alleyway. 

Daf 73b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if they merged </span>the courtyards of <span class="gemarra-regular">the alleyway, they are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted</span> to carry both <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the alleyway, and <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the courtyards.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">they established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the courtyards </span>and also <span class="gemarra-regular">merged </span>the courtyards of <span class="gemarra-regular">the alleyway, and one of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">residents of the courtyard forgot and did not </span>contribute to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiru</span><span class="gemarra-italic">v</span> in his courtyard, but did participate in the merging of the courtyards in the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are permitted</span> both <span class="gemarra-regular">here and there, </span>as the merging of courtyards in the alleyway serves as an effective <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the courtyards as well. 
However, if one <span class="gemarra-regular">of the residents</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the alleyway </span>forgot <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not </span>participate in the <span class="gemarra-regular">merging </span>of courtyards that open into the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted </span>to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">in the courtyards and prohibited </span>from carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">in the alleyway, as </span>the principle is: <span class="gemarra-regular">An alleyway is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as a courtyard is to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">houses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is this mishna? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: We require an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and we </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">require a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">merging </span>of the courtyards in an alleyway, and one is not sufficient without the other. 
The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">middle clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">merged </span>the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">in the alleyway, they are permitted </span>to carry both <span class="gemarra-regular">here and there. We have arrived at </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one is enough, </span>and one does not need both an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> and a merging of alleyways. 
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">That</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not difficult, </span>as the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if they also merged </span>the courtyards in the alleyway, they are permitted to carry in the courtyards and in the alleyway. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say the latter clause </span>of the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">they established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the courtyards and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">merged</span> the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">in the alleyway, and one of the residents</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the courtyard forgot and did not </span>contribute to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> in his courtyard but did participate in the merging of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are permitted </span>to carry both <span class="gemarra-regular">here</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and there. What are the circumstances? If </span>the person who forgot <span class="gemarra-regular">did not renounce </span>his rights to the courtyard in favor of the others, <span class="gemarra-regular">why are they permitted </span>to carry? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious that he did renounce </span>those rights. But if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">say the last clause </span>of the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one of the members of the alleyway forgot </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and did not </span>participate in the <span class="gemarra-regular">merging </span>of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are permitted </span>to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">in the courtyards and prohibited </span>from carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">in the alleyway. But if he renounced </span>his rights, <span class="gemarra-regular">why are they prohibited </span>from carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">in the alleyway?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">renunciation of rights is not </span>effective <span class="gemarra-regular">in an alleyway, </span>that answer is insufficient. <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to an alleyway: <span class="gemarra-regular">As he renounced his rights </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in your favor; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir? </span>This indicates that Rabbi Meir accepts the principle of renunciation of rights in an alleyway. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that the person who forgot to participate in the merging of alleyways <span class="gemarra-regular">did not renounce </span>his rights. <span class="gemarra-regular">And from the </span>fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause </span>of the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did not renounce </span>his rights, it can be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did not renounce </span>his rights. This would indicate that if they carried out a merging of alleyways, it also serves as an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, even when one of them forgot to contribute to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> and also failed to renounce his rights in the courtyard. This is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, which leads to the puzzling conclusion that the <span class="gemarra-regular">first and last clauses</span> of the mishna are in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>while the <span class="gemarra-regular">middle clause </span>is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis.</span>
The Gemara answers: In fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is all</span> in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir. And what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir said we require an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and we </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">require a merging </span>of alleyways? It was only so <span class="gemarra-regular">as not to cause the </span>halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">category</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to be forgotten by the children. </span>If people would only merge courtyards, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of establishing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for a courtyard would gradually be forgotten. <span class="gemarra-regular">And here, </span>where only one person forgot to contribute to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> most of </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for the courtyards, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">will not be forgotten. </span>Therefore, there is room to be lenient after the fact and to permit carrying in both places. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: Rav did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teach </span>the mishna as stating that the five courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">open</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into one another, </span>but rather that each courtyard opens into the alleyway, and each established its own <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so too, Rav Kahana said: Rav did not teach </span>the mishna as stating that the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">open into one another. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana himself did not teach </span>the mishna as stating that the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">open into one another.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav Yosef: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason he did not teach </span>the mishna as stating that the five courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">open into one another? </span>Rav Yosef replied: Because <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">any merging </span>of alleyways <span class="gemarra-regular">that is not brought in and taken out by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">way of the entrances </span>that open <span class="gemarra-regular">into the alleyway, </span>i.e., which is not brought from each courtyard into the alleyway and then taken from the alleyway into the courtyard where it will be deposited, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not considered </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">merging </span>of the alleyway. If the food used for the merging of alleyways is transferred directly from one courtyard to another, it seems as though it is being used to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. It is therefore ineffective as a merging of alleyways. Here too, if the courtyards open into one another, the merging of alleyways is invalid, due to a concern that the residents of the courtyard will transfer the food directly from one courtyard to another. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raised an objection to him </span>based upon the following mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">A homeowner who was a partner of his neighbors, with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this one in wine and with that one in wine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, they do not need to establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This indicates that it is not actually necessary to transfer the food used for the merging of alleyways from one place to another. For example, it is sufficient to have a jointly owned barrel of wine in one courtyard even if it did not pass through the alleyway. The Gemara rejects this proof and explains the mishna as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they took </span>the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">out </span>into the alleyway and subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">brought it in </span>to the courtyard where it was to be kept.
<span class="gemarra-regular">He raised </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">objection to him </span>from a different mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">How does one merge </span>courtyards that open <span class="gemarra-regular">into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> alleyways? </span>The mishna continues and says that it is sufficient for one person to acquire the food used for the merging on behalf of all the other residents of the alleyway. This indicates that the food does not need to pass through all the courtyards in the alleyway. The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">There too, </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>the food <span class="gemarra-regular">out</span> from each of the courtyards into the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>from there <span class="gemarra-regular">brought it into </span>the courtyard where it was to be deposited.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Ḥanan strongly objects to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this: However, if </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is so, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he transferred ownership</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of bread in his basket to </span>another person, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it would not be </span>considered a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">merging. And if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">so, didn’t Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda say that Rav said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">members of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a group who were dining </span>together on Shabbat eve, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the day became sanctified for them, </span>i.e., Shabbat began while they were eating, <span class="gemarra-regular">they may rely upon the bread</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the table as an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> some say, as a merging </span>of the alleyway.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba said: </span>The two versions <span class="gemarra-regular">do not disagree </span>with each other regarding whether the bread counts as an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> or as a merging of the alleyway. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>where they can use it as an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they were dining</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a house, </span>since food deposited inside a house can serve as an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they were dining in a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> courtyard, </span>and therefore they may rely on the bread as a merging of the alleyway. This proves that even Rav agrees that it is not necessary to take the food used to merge an alleyway into the alleyway itself and then bring it back to the courtyard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>we must retract the previous explanation and say that <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reason Rav </span>did not teach the mishna as stating that the courtyards opened into one another is <span class="gemarra-regular">that he holds</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway cannot </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered permitted </span>for carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">through</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a side post and </span>a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam unless there are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> houses and courtyards opening into it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If, however, the courtyards open into one another, they are considered like a single courtyard, in which case they cannot be rendered permitted for carrying through a side post or a cross beam, and the merging of the alleyway is ineffective.
The Gemara now examines <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter itself</span> cited in the previous discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: An alleyway </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cannot </span>become <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">through a side post and </span>a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam,</span>

Daf 74a

<span class="gemarra-regular">unless there are houses and courtyards opening into </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it. </span>This formulation implies that there must be at least two courtyards, each of which contains at least two houses. In the absence of these conditions, however, it is not considered an alleyway that can be permitted by means of a side post or a cross beam. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Even one house </span>without a courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and one courtyard </span>with just one house is enough. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a ruin </span>and a courtyard with a house suffice for a side post or a cross beam to render carrying in an alleyway permitted. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav Yosef: </span>Did <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even a vineyard pat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> and a courtyard with a house suffice to allow a side post or a cross beam to render carrying in the alleyway permitted? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: Rabbi Yoḥanan said </span>his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a ruin, which is fit </span>to serve <span class="gemarra-regular">as a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> residence. However, a vineyard path, which is not fit </span>to serve <span class="gemarra-regular">as a residence, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sufficient.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: And Rabbi Yoḥanan followed his </span>regular line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasonin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> in this regard, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon said: Roofs, enclosures, and courtyards are all </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">one domain with regard to vessels that rested inside them</span> at the beginning of Shabbat. Therefore, it is permitted to carry vessels that were in one of these areas at the beginning of Shabbat to any of the other areas. However, they are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered the same domain <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to vessels that rested inside the house </span>at the beginning of Shabbat. If the homeowners did not join the courtyard by means of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, it is prohibited to carry vessels from their houses to the roof, enclosure, or courtyard. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav said: The halakha is in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon. And this is </span>only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the residents of the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for each courtyard, so that they may only carry the vessels left in the courtyards, but they may not take out vessels from their houses into their courtyards. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if they established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for each courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">we decree </span>against carrying even vessels that were in the courtyard when Shabbat began, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest they come to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">take out objects </span>from their <span class="gemarra-regular">houses to the courtyard. </span>This would lead to the mistake of carrying those objects from one courtyard to another, which is prohibited.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the residents of the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">established </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for each courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">or whether they did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for each courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">And so too, Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, whether they established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for each courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">or whether they did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for each courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not decree </span>against carrying vessels that began Shabbat in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">lest they come to take out objects from </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">houses to the courtyard. Here too, </span>with regard to an alleyway that contains a ruin, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not decree </span>against carrying in the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">lest they come to take out </span><span class="gemarra-regular">objects from the courtyard to the ruin </span>by carrying it through the alleyway. Although the ruin is not included in the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, as it has no residents, and one may not carry objects into it, Rabbi Yoḥanan is not concerned that one might come to carry in this prohibited manner. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beruna sat and recited this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> stated by Shmuel, that an alleyway containing one house and one courtyard can be rendered permitted for carrying by means of a side post or a cross beam. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">student of a Torah academy, said to him: Did Shmuel </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? </span>Rav Beruna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Yes, </span>he did. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: Show me his lodging </span>and I will go and ask him myself, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he showed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him. </span>Rabbi Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Shmuel </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Did <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? </span>Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Yes, </span>I did.
Rabbi Elazar raised the following objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it the Master </span>himself who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>concerning a different issue: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, we have only the wording of our</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mishna. </span>The mishna states <span class="gemarra-regular">that an alleyway is to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyards like a courtyard is to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">houses, </span>which indicates that an alleyway must have at least two courtyards in order to be considered an alleyway and be rendered permitted for carrying through a side post or cross beam. Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">was silen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and did not answer him.
The Gemara asks: Did Shmuel’s silence indicate that he <span class="gemarra-regular">accepted </span>Rabbi Elazar’s objection and retracted his statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">or did he not accept it from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him? </span>The Gemara attempts to bring a proof from the following incident. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain alleyway </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that Ivut bar Ihi lived in, </span>which contained only one house and one courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">He erected a side post for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it, and Shmuel permitted him </span>to carry in it. 

Daf 74b

Following Shmuel’s death, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Anan came and threw </span>the side post down, thus indicating to Ivut bar Ihi that it is prohibited to carry in the alleyway, as a side post is effective only for an alleyway that has at least two courtyards containing at least two houses each. Ivut bar Ihi <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>with resentment: <span class="gemarra-regular">The alleyway in which I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have been living and walking </span>based on a ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the name of Master Shmuel, shall Rav Anan bar Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>now and <span class="gemarra-regular">throw </span>its side post away <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>me? The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from </span>the fact that this side post remained intact throughout Shmuel’s lifetime that he <span class="gemarra-regular">did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not accept </span>Rabbi Elazar’s objection.
The Gemara rejects this proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, you can</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">accepted </span>Rabbi Elazar’s objection and retracted his opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">and here there was </span>a synagogue <span class="gemarra-regular">attendan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥazzana</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who would eat bread in his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">house </span>that was located elsewhere, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">come and sleep in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">synagogue, </span>which was open to the alleyway.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Ivut bar Ihi holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the place </span>where a person eats his <span class="gemarra-regular">bread determines </span>his place of residence. Therefore, he did not consider the synagogue a residence, as the attendant would eat elsewhere, and Ivut bar Ihi thought that Shmuel had permitted him to set up a side post for his alleyway even though he lived there by himself. In fact, however, this was not the case, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel followed his </span>regular line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: The place </span>where a person <span class="gemarra-regular">sleeps determines </span>his place of residence. Since the attendant would sleep in the synagogue, it was considered a residence. Consequently, the alleyway contained two houses and courtyards, and could be made permitted for carrying by means of a side post or a cross beam.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway, one side of which </span>was occupied by <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one side of which </span>was occupied by <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the house of the Jew was connected to the houses of other Jews via windows but not via doors, and those other houses open directly into the public domain, the residents of the houses on the side of the alleyway where the Jews live <span class="gemarra-regular">may not establish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> through the window</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to render </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for the residents of the other houses to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">through the doors </span>of the house leading <span class="gemarra-regular">to the alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav Yosef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Did <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav say </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">even with regard to a courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one side of which was occupied by a gentile and the other side of which was occupied by a Jew whose house was connected through windows to the houses of other Jews? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: Yes, as </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he did not say </span>so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>would be the difference? It is the exact same principle.
Abaye responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">I would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the rationale for </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is because he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway cannot be rendered</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted </span>for carrying within it <span class="gemarra-regular">with a side post and</span> a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam unless there are houses and courtyards opening</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into it. </span>
Rav Yosef said: If that were the reason, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">I need two </span>rulings regarding the same issue? Rav already stated that an alleyway can be rendered permitted for carrying within it only if it has houses and courtyards opening into it. Abaye explained that both rulings are <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary. As, if </span>Rav had taught this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">from that </span>general ruling, 

Daf 75a

<span class="gemarra-regular">I would have said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the residence of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentile is considered a residence </span>with regard to defining an area as an alleyway. Therefore, he <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that the</span> legal <span class="gemarra-regular">status of the residence of a gentile is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> considered a </span>full-fledged <span class="gemarra-regular">residence </span>in this regard. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>Rav had taught this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to gentiles, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">I do not know how many houses there </span>are. Therefore, he <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that there must be at least <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">houses </span>and two courtyards. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Now that Rav </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard, </span>this implies that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason for </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav is that he holds: It is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited for an individual to establish </span>his home <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile </span>resides. Consequently, he is prohibited from establishing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, so that the difficulties of living there will force him to move. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: If so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, this is </span>why <span class="gemarra-regular">I heard Rabbi Tavla say: A gentile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, a gentile, two time</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> while teaching this subject, even though <span class="gemarra-regular">I did not understand </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">what he </span>meant to <span class="gemarra-regular">say. </span>Now I realize that he was speaking about both an alleyway and a courtyard.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two courtyards, one </span>of which was <span class="gemarra-regular">within the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the outer one opened into the public domain, the following distinctions apply: If <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inner </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for itself <span class="gemarra-regular">and the outer</span> one <span class="gemarra-regular">did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>carrying in <span class="gemarra-regular">the inner</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one is permitted and </span>carrying in <span class="gemarra-regular">the outer one is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited. </span>
If <span class="gemarra-regular">the outer </span>courtyard established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and the inner </span>one did <span class="gemarra-regular">not, </span>carrying in <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, </span>as the residents of the inner courtyard pass through the outer one, and are considered to a certain extent as residents of the courtyard who did not participate in the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. If <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">established </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for itself, and that </span>courtyard also <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for itself, </span>but they did not establish a joint <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with one another, <span class="gemarra-regular">this one is permitted by itself, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and that one is permitted by itself, </span>but they may not carry from one to the other. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva prohibits </span>carrying in <span class="gemarra-regular">the outer one </span>even in such a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the </span>right of <span class="gemarra-regular">entry </span>to the outer courtyard enjoyed by the residents of the inner courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">renders it prohibited. And the Rabbis </span>disagree and <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>The right of <span class="gemarra-regular">entry </span>enjoyed by the residents of the inner courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">does not render it prohibited. </span>Since the residents of the inner courtyard do not use the outer one other than to pass through it, and they are permitted to carry in their own courtyard, they do not render it prohibited to carry in the outer courtyard.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>resident <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the outer </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot and did not </span>contribute to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>carrying in <span class="gemarra-regular">the inner </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted and </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the outer one is prohibited. </span>If one resident <span class="gemarra-regular">of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inner </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot and did not </span>contribute to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, they are both prohibited, </span>as the right of way enjoyed by the members of the inner courtyard through the outer courtyard renders the outer one prohibited as well. 
If the residents of both courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">put</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in one place, and one </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>he was <span class="gemarra-regular">from the inner </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">or from the outer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one, forgot and did not </span>contribute to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are both prohibited </span>for carrying within them, as the two courtyards are treated as one. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the courtyards belonged <span class="gemarra-regular">to individuals</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., if only one person lived in each courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are not required to establish an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as this requirement applies only to a courtyard occupied by multiple residents. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span>in the name of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yannai: This </span>mishna, which states that if the residents of the outer courtyard established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> but the residents of the inner one did not, they are both prohibited from carrying, is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, who said: Even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">foot </span>of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted in its </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">place, </span>i.e., even someone from a courtyard in which he is permitted to carry, <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited when </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in its </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">place. </span>If he enjoys the right of entry to another courtyard he is considered like a resident of that courtyard as well, and if he does not participate in the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, no one in that courtyard may carry. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis say: Just as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">foot </span>of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>in its own place <span class="gemarra-regular">does not render </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry in another courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>too, the <span class="gemarra-regular">foot </span>of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who is prohibited </span>in his place <span class="gemarra-regular">does not render </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry in another courtyard. Consequently, if only the residents of the outer courtyard established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, the residents of the inner one do not render it prohibited to carry in the outer courtyard. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: If the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the outer </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the inner </span>courtyard did <span class="gemarra-regular">not, they are both </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. Whose </span>opinion is this? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>it is that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, why </span>discuss <span class="gemarra-regular">particularly </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a foot that is prohibited, </span>i.e., a case where the inner courtyard did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? According to Rabbi Akiva, <span class="gemarra-regular">even a foot that is permitted also </span>renders it prohibited to carry. Therefore, even if the residents of the inner courtyard had established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, they would still render it prohibited to carry in the outer courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis? </span>This would indicate that the Rabbis agree that one who may not carry in his own courtyard does, in fact, render it prohibited to carry in a different courtyard through which he has right of entry, contrary to Rabbi Yannai’s claim. 
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>this part of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he teaches </span>the mishna employing the style: <span class="gemarra-regular">Not </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">also that. </span>In other words, he begins by teaching the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a relatively straightforward case and then proceeds to a more complicated example. Consequently, the mishna should be understood as follows: Not only is it prohibited to carry in both courtyards if the residents of the outer courtyard established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> and the residents of the inner one did not, but even if the residents of both courtyards established separate <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span>, it remains prohibited to carry in the outer one.
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for itself, and that </span>courtyard also <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for itself, </span>but the two courtyards did not establish a joint <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with one another, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one is permitted by itself, and that one is permitted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by itself, </span>but it is prohibited to carry from one courtyard to the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>both courtyards are permitted by themselves is that the residents of the inner courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>By inference, if they <span class="gemarra-regular">did not establish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> carrying in <span class="gemarra-regular">both would be prohibited. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who said </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">foot </span>of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who is permitted </span>in his own place <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>render it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry, while the <span class="gemarra-regular">foot </span>of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who is prohibited </span>in its own place <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span>render it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry, <span class="gemarra-regular">who is this </span><span class="it-text">tanna</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>there is a difficulty, as he holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">foot </span>of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>in its own place <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>renders it prohibited to carry in a different place. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>which indicates that the Rabbis agree that the foot of one who is prohibited in its own place does, in fact, render it prohibited to carry in a different place, in contrast to the statement of Rabbi Yannai? <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, from the fact that the latter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">clause </span>that follows immediately states the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>it is clear that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause, </span>with which Rabbi Akiva disagrees, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva. </span>
The Gemara responds: The <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>mishna in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and it is incomplete and teaches the following: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for itself, and that </span>courtyard also <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for itself, </span>but they did not establish a joint <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with one another, <span class="gemarra-regular">this one is permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by itself, and that one is permitted by itself, </span>but they may not carry from one to the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">In</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the inner courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">constructed a </span>small <span class="gemarra-regular">partition </span>at its entrance. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it did not construct a partition, the outer</span> courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Akiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as Rabbi Akiva prohibits </span>carrying in <span class="gemarra-regular">the outer </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>right of <span class="gemarra-regular">entry </span>enjoyed by the members of the inner courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: The </span>right of <span class="gemarra-regular">entry </span>enjoyed by the members of the inner courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">does not render </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abaye raised an objection </span>based upon the final clause of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the courtyards belonged <span class="gemarra-regular">to individuals, </span>i.e., if only one person lived in each courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not required to establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Doesn’t </span>this indicate that if they belong <span class="gemarra-regular">to many </span>people jointly, <span class="gemarra-regular">they need to establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Apparently, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">foot </span>of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who is permitted in his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">place does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">render </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, </span>but the <span class="gemarra-regular">foot </span>of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>in his own place does <span class="gemarra-regular">render </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>This contradicts Rabbi Yannai’s understanding of Rabbi Akiva’s opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Ravina raised a further objection </span>from the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>resident <span class="gemarra-regular">of the outer </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot and did not </span>contribute to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the inner </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>for carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">and the outer one is prohibited. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>resident <span class="gemarra-regular">of the inner </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot and did not </span>contribute to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, both </span>courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited, </span>as the right of way enjoyed by the members of the inner courtyard through the outer courtyard renders the outer one prohibited as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason is that </span>one of the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot </span>to contribute to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not forget</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and each courtyard established its own valid <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">both of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them </span>would be <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. Apparently, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">foot </span>of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted in his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">place does not render </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry, but the <span class="gemarra-regular">foot </span>of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>in his own place does <span class="gemarra-regular">render </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry. This cannot be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, as he holds that even the foot of one who is permitted in his own place renders it prohibited to carry elsewhere. Rather, it must be the opinion of the Rabbis, which proves that even they agree that the foot of one who is prohibited in his own place does render a different courtyard prohibited.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this version must be rejected, and <span class="gemarra-regular">when Ravin came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he cited a different version. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yannai said: There are three disputes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">matter. The first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">foot </span>of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who is permitted in his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">place does not render </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry elsewhere, but the <span class="gemarra-regular">foot </span>of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who is prohibited </span>in his own place does <span class="gemarra-regular">render </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva holds</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">foot </span>of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who is permitted </span>in his own place <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry in a different place. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the latter Rabbis hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">foot </span>of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who is permitted in his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">place does not render </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>too, the <span class="gemarra-regular">foot </span>of one <span class="gemarra-regular">who is prohibited does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">render </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry. This explanation resolves all of the difficulties posed earlier.
It was stated in the mishna: If the residents of both courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">put their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one place, and one </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>he was <span class="gemarra-regular">from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inner </span>courtyard or from the outer one, <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot </span>and did not contribute to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, it is prohibited to carry in both courtyards. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">one place? </span>Is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> different if the two courtyards established their <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in one place or in different places? 
Before continuing, the Gemara provides <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>for the ensuing discussion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Outer; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for itself; in the house of an individual; Ravina; where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the inner one did not forget</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: </span>The mishna is referring to a case when the residents of both courtyards established their <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">the outer </span>courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">And why</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did they call it one </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">eḥad</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Because it is a place that is <span class="gemarra-regular">designated </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">meyuḥ</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ad</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>courtyards, as the members of the inner one also pass through the outer courtyard. Therefore, if a member of the outer courtyard forgot to contribute to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, the inner courtyard is also prohibited. Since the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> of the inner courtyard is located in the outer courtyard, the residents of the inner courtyard cannot separate themselves from the outer one. However, if the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was deposited in the inner courtyard and a member of the outer courtyard forgot to contribute to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, carrying in the inner courtyard is permitted, because in that situation they can separate themselves from the outer courtyard. 

Daf 75b

<span class="gemarra-regular">That was also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">they placed their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">outer </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot </span>to contribute to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, whether he is </span>a resident <span class="gemarra-regular">of the outer </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">or of the inner </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are both prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">they put their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the inner </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>resident <span class="gemarra-regular">of the inner </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot </span>to contribute to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, they are both prohibited. </span>Similarly, if one of the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">of the outer </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">did not </span>contribute to the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, they are both prohibited. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> statement of Rabbi Akiva. And the Rabbis </span>disagree and <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: In this </span>case, where the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was deposited in the inner courtyard and the person who forgot to contribute to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was a resident of the outer one, the <span class="gemarra-regular">inner </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted and the outer one is prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Ḥanan said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abaye: What is different according to the Rabbis, who say</span> that the <span class="gemarra-regular">inner </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the residents of the inner courtyard can <span class="gemarra-regular">shut the door </span>of their courtyard to the members of the outer one <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> use </span>the inner courtyard on their own. But if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Akiva as well, let </span>the residents of the inner courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">shut the door </span>of their courtyard to the members of the outer one <span class="gemarra-regular">and use </span>their courtyard on their own. Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>If the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> of the outer courtyard was not placed in the inner courtyard, your argument would be valid. But the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> is deposited in the inner courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">accustoms </span>the residents of the outer courtyard to enter it. 
The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the Rabbis as well</span> we should say that the placement of the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> in the inner courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">accustoms </span>the residents of the outer courtyard to enter it. The Gemara answers: The reasoning of the Rabbis is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the members of the inner courtyard can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>to the members of the outer one: <span class="gemarra-regular">We joined</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with you </span>in a single <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>our <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not to </span>our <span class="gemarra-regular">detriment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since one of your residents forgot to contribute to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, we no longer acquiesce to this partnership.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Rabbi Akiva as well, let</span> the residents of the inner courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>to the residents of the outer courtyard: <span class="gemarra-regular">We joined with you to </span>our <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit and not to </span>our <span class="gemarra-regular">detriment. </span>The Gemara answers that according to Rabbi Akiva, the case is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the residents of the outer courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to the residents of the inner courtyard: <span class="gemarra-regular">We renounce our rights in your favor, </span>in which case the inhabitants of the inner courtyard are permitted to carry in their own courtyard. Consequently, his ruling that the inner courtyard is also prohibited applies only before the residents of the outer courtyard renounce their rights. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>hold that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no renunciation of rights </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from courtyard to courtyard. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel and Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>who disagree about whether there is renunciation of rights from one courtyard to another, <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree about the </span>same point that was the subject of a <span class="gemarra-regular">disagreement between the Rabbis and Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Akiva. As Shmuel said </span>that there is no renunciation of rights from one courtyard to another, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, and Rabbi Yoḥanan said </span>that such renunciation is valid, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Akiva.</span>
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: What I said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is even in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva stated </span>his opinion that there is renunciation of rights from one courtyard to another <span class="gemarra-regular">only here, with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to two courtyards, one within the other, which render each </span><span class="gemarra-regular">other prohibited. However, there, </span>where they disagree about two adjacent courtyards, <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">render each other prohibited? </span>Consequently, even Rabbi Akiva would agree that there is no renunciation of rights from one courtyard to another. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said: What I said is even in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. The Rabbis stated </span>their opinion that there is no renunciation of rights from one courtyard to another <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">here, as </span>the residents of the inner courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the residents of the outer courtyard: <span class="gemarra-regular">Until you renounce </span>your rights <span class="gemarra-regular">in our favor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, you render </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">us </span>to carry, and therefore, we will have no connection with you and forgo both the renunciation and the prohibition. <span class="gemarra-regular">But there, does </span>one courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibit </span>the other? Since it does not, even the Rabbis would agree that there is renunciation from one courtyard to another. 
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the courtyards belonged <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> individuals, </span>i.e., if only one person lived in each courtyard, they are not required to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosef said: Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">there were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> three </span>people living in the two courtyards, whether two people lived in the outer courtyard and one person in the inner one, or two people lived in the inner courtyard and one person lived in the outer one, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> from carrying without an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai said to </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not listen to him, </span>as he is mistaken. <span class="gemarra-regular">I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> told it to him, and I told it to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the name of Rav Adda bar Ahava, </span>not Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, but due to his illness Rav Yosef forgot this detail. And the reason that the residents of both courtyards are prohibited from carrying if two people are living in the outer courtyard is that <span class="gemarra-regular">since I call them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> many in the outer </span>courtyard, the Sages issued a decree prohibiting carrying, due to a case in which there are two people living in the inner courtyard. When he heard this, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said </span>in astonishment: <span class="gemarra-regular">Master of Abraham! </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I mistook </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi for </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">many [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">rabbim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">].</span> He now realized that he had mistakenly understood this ruling as attributed to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi rather than a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> regarding many, an error that led to his inaccurate version of the teaching. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: Actually, they are permitted, unless</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there are two </span>people living <span class="gemarra-regular">in the inner </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and one in the outer one. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And a gentile is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like many</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., if a gentile lives in the inner courtyard, the gentile’s right of way in the outer courtyard renders it prohibited to carry there. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">Jew </span>living in the inner courtyard, that <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not prohibit </span>the resident of the outer courtyard? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because one who knows </span>that only one person lives there <span class="gemarra-regular">knows </span>this fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who does not know </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">thinks </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has been established. </span>If so, in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile also, we </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">say that</span> one <span class="gemarra-regular">who knows </span>that only one person lives there <span class="gemarra-regular">knows</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and one <span class="gemarra-regular">who does not know </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">thinks </span>that the Jew must have <span class="gemarra-regular">rented </span>the domain from the gentile.
The Gemara answers: This is not so, as <span class="gemarra-regular">a typical</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentile, if he </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">rented </span>out his domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would chatter </span>about it, and everyone would know. If he has not talked about it, everyone will assume that he did not rent out his domain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>If there are <span class="gemarra-regular">ten houses, one within the other, </span>so that the person living in the innermost house must pass through all the rest in order to reach the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">the innermost one </span>alone <span class="gemarra-regular">contributes to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is enough. </span>The residents of the other houses are considered as living in the gatehouse and corridor of the innermost one, and therefore they do not have to contribute to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">outer one </span>must contribute to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. The Gemara asks: The <span class="gemarra-regular">outer </span>residence <span class="gemarra-regular">is a gatehous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in relation to the inner ones, so why should it have to contribute to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? The Gemara answers that Rabbi Yoḥanan was referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">outer </span>house <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">innermost one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, even the second-to-last house, the outer one only in relation to the innermost house, must contribute to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, as it is not viewed as a gatehouse.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? One Sage, </span>Shmuel, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the gatehouse of an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> individual is considered a gatehouse, </span>and therefore the ninth house, i.e., the second innermost is also a gatehouse, as it serves as a passageway for the individual living in the innermost house, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one Sage, </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the gatehouse of an individual <span class="gemarra-regular">is not considered a gatehouse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and therefore the ninth house must also contribute to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Avuh said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two courtyards</span> that have <span class="gemarra-regular">three houses between them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and a resident of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">comes through this </span>house that opens to his courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and places his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in that </span>middle house, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a resident of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>other courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">comes through this</span> house that opens to his courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and places his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in that </span>middle house, 

Daf 76a

<span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>outer house <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes a gatehouse to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>outer house <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes a gatehouse to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>courtyard, and therefore the residents of the outer houses need not contribute to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The middle </span>house between them <span class="gemarra-regular">is the house in which the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is placed, </span>and therefore its residents <span class="gemarra-regular">need not contribute bread </span>for the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
The Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">Raḥava tested </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sages: </span>If there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two courtyards and two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> between them, </span>and a resident of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">came through this </span>house that opens to his courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">placed his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in that </span>house farther from his courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a resident of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>other courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">came through this </span>house that opens to his courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and placed his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span>house that opens to the other courtyard, did <span class="gemarra-regular">they acquire the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or not, </span>i.e., are the two <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span> valid? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you render it a house with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to this </span>courtyard, whose <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was placed there, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a gatehouse with regard to that </span>one who passed through it in order to place his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in the other house? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, do you render the other house <span class="gemarra-regular">a gatehouse with regard to this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">and a house </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to that </span>one? 
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Raḥava: <span class="gemarra-regular">Neither</span> of them <span class="gemarra-regular">has acquired </span>his <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Whichever way you </span>look at it, it is difficult: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you consider </span>either house <span class="gemarra-regular">a gatehouse, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who places</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a gatehouse, a porch, or a balcony</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>is that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">if you consider </span>either one <span class="gemarra-regular">a house, he would be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">carrying into a house for which he is not establishing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Since the assumption that benefits one of them harms the other, and there is no way to establish firmly the status of these houses, the residents of both courtyards fail to acquire their <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
Raḥava asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>makes this case <span class="gemarra-regular">different from </span>the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava? As Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>people who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span> one person: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go and establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> of Shabbat limits <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>each of <span class="gemarra-regular">us, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day, and he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one during twilight, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the one for whom he established an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> while it was still day was eaten during twilight</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the one for whom he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> during twiligh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was eaten after nightfall, both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of them have acquired their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Twilight is of doubtful status as to whether it is considered day or night. If it is night, any <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> established at that time is invalid, and if it is day, any <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> eaten at that time is invalid. Rava nonetheless ruled leniently, despite the fact that two contradictory assumptions are involved, in keeping with the principle that in cases of doubt relating to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is lenient. Consequently, with regard to the one whose <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was eaten during twilight, it is considered as though it was already night, and therefore his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> had already taken effect while it was still day before it was eaten. Conversely, with regard to the one whose <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was established during twilight, that period of time is viewed as day, and therefore his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is valid as well. 
The Sages respond: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span><span class="gemarra-regular">can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? There, </span>where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>whether it is <span class="gemarra-regular">day </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>whether it is <span class="gemarra-regular">night, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the matter is not noticeable, </span>as no one sees exactly when each <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was established. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>where the houses are clearly distinguishable, <span class="gemarra-regular">if with regard to this </span>one, who placed his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> there, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a house, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to that </span>one, who passed through it, it should also be regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">a house. </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">if, with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to this </span>one, who passed through it, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a gatehouse, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to that </span>one, who placed his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> there, it should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gatehouse. </span>Therefore, neither of them acquires his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. 

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a window</span> in a wall that separates <span class="gemarra-regular">between two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyards</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the window measures <span class="gemarra-regular">four by four </span>handbreadths and is <span class="gemarra-regular">within</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ten </span>handbreadths of the ground, the inhabitants of the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one for each courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they desire, they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>thereby merging the two courtyards, as they may be considered as one due to the window.
However, if the window measures <span class="gemarra-regular">less than four by four</span> handbreadths, or if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">above ten </span>handbreadths from the ground, it is no longer considered a valid opening, and the two courtyards cannot be considered a single courtyard. Therefore, the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not establish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s determination that the size of the window must be four by four handbreadths, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>an <span class="gemarra-regular">unattributed </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the previously cited opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who said: Any </span>gap <span class="gemarra-regular">less </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered </span><span class="gemarra-italic">lavud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., two objects are considered connected if the space between them is less than four handbreadths. That would explain why the window must be four handbreadths in size, as otherwise it would be considered as though it were sealed, based on the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span>.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if you say </span>that the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>that only gaps of less than three handbreadths are included in the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis disagreed with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel only with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-italic">lavud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., what is considered connected. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to an opening, even the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis agree that if there is </span>an opening of <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by four </span>handbreadths, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">significant, and if not, it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not significant.</span>
It was taught in the mishna: If the window is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than four </span>by four handbreadths, or above ten handbreadths from the ground, the residents of each courtyard must establish a separate <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious. Since</span> the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>in the previous clause that if the window is <span class="gemarra-regular">four by four </span>handbreadths and <span class="gemarra-regular">within ten </span>handbreadths from the ground, they establish one <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">itself I kno</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> that if the window is <span class="gemarra-regular">less </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than four </span>by four handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">or above ten </span>handbreadths, they may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>establish one <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. Why was it necessary to teach this in the mishna?
The Gemara answers: It <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this </span>matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reason </span>is specifically that <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire </span>window is <span class="gemarra-regular">above ten</span> handbreadths; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">part of it is within ten </span>handbreadths of the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">they establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they desire, they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara comments: According to this explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> which <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If nearly <span class="gemarra-regular">all of </span>the window <span class="gemarra-regular">is above ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>only a small <span class="gemarra-regular">part of it is within ten </span>handbreadths, or if nearly <span class="gemarra-regular">all of it is within ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>only a small <span class="gemarra-regular">part of it is above ten </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">they establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and if they desire, they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The essential meaning of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is clear, but the Gemara raises a question with regard to its formulation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, </span>if nearly <span class="gemarra-regular">all of it is above ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>only a small <span class="gemarra-regular">part of it is within ten </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">you said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if they desire, they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the window has the status of an opening and therefore the two courtyards may establish a joint <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, then <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it necessary </span>to state the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing the case where almost <span class="gemarra-regular">all of it is within ten and </span>only a small <span class="gemarra-regular">part of it is above ten?</span>
The Gemara answers that indeed, this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>employing the style: <span class="gemarra-regular">This, and it is unnecessary to say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that, </span>moving from the more difficult and novel case to the easier, more straightforward one. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan said: A circular window must have a circumference of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-fou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handbreadths, with two and a bit of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them within ten </span>handbreadths of the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he squares </span>the window, i.e., if he forms the shape of a square inside it, it measures four by four handbreadths, and <span class="gemarra-regular">a bit </span>of it <span class="gemarra-regular">is then within</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ten </span>handbreadths of the ground. 
The Gemara poses a question with regard to this calculation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, since</span> there is a general principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>circle <span class="gemarra-regular">with a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> circumference of three handbreadths is one handbreadth in diameter, </span>then according to this formula, a window with a circumference <span class="gemarra-regular">of twelve </span>handbreadths, meaning that it has a diameter of four handbreadths, should be <span class="gemarra-regular">sufficient </span>to create a window of four by four. 

Daf 76b

<span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>measurement <span class="gemarra-regular">applies </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">to a circle </span>and the ratio between its circumference and diameter, <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a square </span>that must fit entirely within that circle, <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">require </span>a circle with a <span class="gemarra-regular">larger </span>circumference. In order for a square of four by four handbreadths to be entirely contained within a circle, the circumference of the circle must measure more than twelve handbreadths
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, how much larger is a square than </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a circle? </span>It is larger by <span class="gemarra-regular">one quarter. </span>If so, a circle <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a circumference of <span class="gemarra-regular">sixteen </span>handbreadths at most should <span class="gemarra-regular">suffice.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>statement that a square is larger than a circle by a quarter <span class="gemarra-regular">applies </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">to a circle circumscribed by a square, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a square circumscribed by a circle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we require more, </span>and the difference between the square and the circle is greater. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the projection of the corners </span>of the square, as the distance from the center of the square to its corners is greater than the distance from the center to its sides. 
The Gemara further objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since every cubit in </span>the side of <span class="gemarra-regular">a square </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a cubit and two-fifths in the diagonal, </span>a square of four by four handbreadths has a diagonal of five and three-fifths handbreadths. And since the diameter of a circle equals the diagonal of the square that it encompasses, the circle circumscribing a square of four by four handbreadths has a diameter of five and three-fifths handbreadths. If that measure is multiplied by three to arrive at the circumference of that circle, the result is that a circle with a circumference of <span class="gemarra-regular">seventeen handbreadths minus a fifth is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sufficient </span>to circumscribe a square of four by four handbreadths. Why, then, does Rabbi Yoḥanan say that a circular window must have a circumference of twenty-four handbreadths? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan spoke in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> judges of Caesarea, and some say in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages of Caesarea, who say: A circle</span> that is circumscribed <span class="gemarra-regular">within a square </span>is smaller than it by <span class="gemarra-regular">one quarter; </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a square </span>that is circumscribed <span class="gemarra-regular">within a circle, </span>the difference between them is equal to <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the square. According to this explanation, Rabbi Yoḥanan calculated as follows: Since a square of four by four handbreadths has a perimeter of sixteen handbreadths, the circumference of the circle that encompasses it must be fifty percent larger, or twenty-four handbreadths. 
It was taught in the mishna: If a window is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than four by four </span>handbreadths, or if it is above ten handbreadths from the ground, the residents of the two courtyards may not establish one joint <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> but must instead establish two independent ones. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥman said: They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a window within ten handbreadths of the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">window between two courtyards. But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a window </span><span class="gemarra-regular">between two houses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">above ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, if they wish to establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. What is the reason </span>for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? It is that <span class="gemarra-regular">a house is considered as though </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">filled</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore there is no difference between below and above ten handbreadths with regard to a window in a house.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raised an objection to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span>from that which was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A window </span><span class="gemarra-regular">between two courtyards, and a window between two houses, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a window between two attics, and a window between two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">roofs, and a window between two rooms are all one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the same to me; they all </span>must be <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by four </span>handbreadths and <span class="gemarra-regular">within ten </span>handbreadths from the ground. This directly contradicts Rav Naḥman’s opinion.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Explain </span>that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of ten handbreadths mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring only to <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyards. </span>The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: Are all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one and the same to me, </span>indicating that they are all equal in this regard? Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">explain </span>that they are all equal in that the window must be the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">four by four </span>handbreadths, but not that all must be within ten handbreadths of the ground. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba raised a dilemma before Rav Naḥman: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an aperture that opens from </span>the ceiling of <span class="gemarra-regular">a house </span>occupied by one person <span class="gemarra-regular">to an attic </span>occupied by another, <span class="gemarra-regular">must a permanent ladder </span>be positioned in the opening <span class="gemarra-regular">to render </span>carrying from one level to the other <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>by turning the two into a single residence? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or, is a permanent ladder not necessary to render it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted?</span>
The Gemara clarifies the two sides of the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">When we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a house is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">considered as though it </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">filled, </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">this apply </span>only to a window positioned <span class="gemarra-regular">on the side, but not </span>to a window <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle? </span>In that case, the opening would not be viewed as near the full part of the house, and a permanent ladder would be required. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps there is no difference, </span>and since the house is considered filled, no ladder is necessary.
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: It is not necessary. </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">understood from </span>this response that he meant that <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permanent ladder is not required, but a temporary ladder is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> required. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated </span>in this regard: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Manyumi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: Neither a permanent</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ladder nor a temporary ladder is required, </span>as the fact that the opening is located within the house is sufficient to render it permitted to carry from the house to the attic.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">a wall between </span><span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high and four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the residents of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a separate one for each courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not establish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">If there was produce on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> top </span>of the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>residents of one courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ascend from this side and eat </span>from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and those</span> residents of the other courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">may ascend from that side</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and eat </span>from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that they do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lower </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">down </span>from on top of the wall to one of the courtyards. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">If the wall was breached</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the following distinction applies: If the breach was <span class="gemarra-regular">up</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to ten cubits </span>wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">they establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they desire, they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> similar to an entrance, </span>like any opening less than ten cubits wide. If the breach was <span class="gemarra-regular">more than this, they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not establish two, </span>as a breach of this size nullifies the partition and joins the two courtyards into a single domain.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: If this wall <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths in width, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>In this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">the air of two domains controls it. </span>Since the wall is not broad enough to be regarded a domain of its own, the top of the wall is seen as belonging to both courtyards and is then prohibited to both of them. Accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not move </span>anything <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>top of the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>as much as <span class="gemarra-regular">a hair’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">breadth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 

Daf 77a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: These </span>residents of one courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">may raise </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>their courtyard to the top of the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">and eat </span>it there, and they may lower the food from the wall to the courtyard; <span class="gemarra-regular">and those </span>residents of the other courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">may raise </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>their courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and eat </span>it there, and they may lower the food from the wall to the courtyard. This is because the wall is considered nonexistent, and its domain is viewed as part of the two courtyards.
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: If there was produce on top of the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>residents of one courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">may ascend from this side</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and eat </span>from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and those </span>residents of the other courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">may ascend from that side and eat </span>from it. The Gemara infers from this: To <span class="gemarra-regular">ascend, yes, </span>it is permitted, but to <span class="gemarra-regular">raise </span>food from the courtyard to the top of the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>it is not permitted. This presents a challenge to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion.
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>If the top of the wall between the two courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">is four by four </span>handbreadths, then to <span class="gemarra-regular">ascend, yes, </span>it is permitted. However, to <span class="gemarra-regular">raise </span>food, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>it is prohibited, because in that case the top of the wall is considered a domain in its own right. But if <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not four by four </span>handbreadths, it is an exempt domain, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">they may raise </span>their food onto the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">as well</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan followed his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning </span>in this regard, <span class="gemarra-regular">as when Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a place that does not have </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">four by four </span>handbreadths and is situated between a public and a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permissible for </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> people in the public domain and for the people in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the private domain to </span>adjust the burden on their <span class="gemarra-regular">shoulders</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon it, provided they do not exchange </span>objects between them from one domain to the other domain. This demonstrates that in the case of an exempt domain, Rabbi Yoḥanan was not concerned that one might carry from one domain to another, and permitted members of both domains to use it. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, </span>who prohibits carrying in that case even as much as a hair’s breadth, <span class="gemarra-regular">not accept </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Dimi </span>in this matter? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>this referred <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>an exempt domain situated between two <span class="gemarra-regular">domains </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law, </span>i.e., between a public and a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>Rav would agree that the members of both domains may adjust their burdens there.
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">with what are we dealing here, </span>in the case of the wall? We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with domains by rabbinic </span><span class="gemarra-regular">law, and the Sages reinforced their statement</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> even <span class="gemarra-regular">more than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> those of the Torah. </span>Due to their severity, Torah laws are generally observed. Therefore, there is no need to impose decrees and enactments in order to preserve them. The same is not true of rabbinic decrees; if people ignore the preventive measures, they might come to violate the entire enactment. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a wall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is between two courtyards, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">one side </span>facing one courtyard is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths high, and the other side </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is level with the ground </span>of the second courtyard, i.e., the second courtyard is built on a higher plane, so that the wall is less than ten handbreadths above its floor, in this case the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">grant </span>the use of the top of the wall on Shabbat only <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>courtyard in which the wall is <span class="gemarra-regular">level with the ground. </span>
The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the use of </span>the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">is convenient for one </span>side, i.e., the higher courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">but difficult for the other </span>side. The wall can be used more conveniently by the residents of the higher courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the principle is that in <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>case with regard to Shabbat where an action is <span class="gemarra-regular">convenient for one </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">and difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for another, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">grant it to the one for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whom its use is convenient.</span>
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheizvi said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a ditch</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> between two courtyards</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one side of which is ten</span> handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">deep, and the other side of which is level</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with the ground </span>of the second courtyard, i.e., is less than ten handbreadths below it, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">grant </span>the use of the ditch <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>courtyard in which the ditch is <span class="gemarra-regular">level with the ground. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is</span> a case in which <span class="gemarra-regular">the use of </span>the ditch <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> convenient for one </span>side, where it is close to level with the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">and difficult for the other, </span>where the ditch is ten handbreadths deep, and whenever use of an item is convenient for one party and inconvenient for another, it is granted to the one for whom it is convenient.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to cite both of these cases, as it would not have been possible to learn one from the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">since, had </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>only the case <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a wall, </span>one could have said that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies only in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">people use an elevated </span>surface. Even for the residents of the lower courtyard, it is relatively easy to use this wall. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a ditch, people do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">use a deep </span>surface, as it is troublesome to bend down and place an item in a ditch. In that case, one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that it may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be used by the residents of either courtyard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>likewise, <span class="gemarra-regular">had he taught us</span> only the case <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a ditch, </span>one could have said that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies only in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">because its use does not cause worry, </span>as anything placed in the ditch is protected. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wall, the use of which causes worry </span>that the objects placed there are liable to fall, one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that it may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be used by the residents of either courtyard. Therefore, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state both of these rulings.
With regard to a wall between two courtyards, the Gemara states: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one comes to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">diminish </span>the height of the wall by placing a stone next to it, or by building a platform in order to permit its use or to utilize it as a passageway to another courtyard, the following distinction applies: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> diminished </span>section <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">four handbreadths </span>wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted to use the entire wall. </span>This area has the status of an entrance and the two courtyards are considered one, which renders the entire wall permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if </span>the diminished section is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>at least four handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span> may <span class="gemarra-regular">use only the </span>area of the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">diminished </span>section, but no more.
The Gemara challenges this ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whichever </span><span class="gemarra-regular">way you </span>look at it, this ruling is difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the diminishing was effective, although </span>it extends less than four handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him use </span>the entire <span class="gemarra-regular">wall; </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the diminishing <span class="gemarra-regular">was not effective, even </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">corresponding to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">diminished </span>section should <span class="gemarra-regular">also not </span>be permitted for use, as this section is insignificant. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>Here, it refers to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one removed a segment </span>of stone <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the to</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> of the wall. Since the wall is actually less than ten handbreadths high along that section, it is fit for use as is an opening in the wall.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yeḥiel said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one overturned a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> basin </span>and placed it next to a wall, such that the wall is no longer ten handbreadths high, <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span> effectively <span class="gemarra-regular">diminishes </span>the height of the wall. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why </span>should this be so? Isn’t this basin <span class="gemarra-regular">an item that may be moved on Shabbat, </span>i.e., something that one is permitted to handle? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the principle is that <span class="gemarra-regular">an item that may be moved on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shabbat does not diminish </span>a wall. Since it can be removed at any moment on Shabbat, such an object cannot be viewed as a permanent part of the wall. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, it is necessary; </span>this basin can be considered a permanent part of the wall in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he attached </span>the basin <span class="gemarra-regular">to the ground </span>by covering it with soil. The basin may then not be moved on Shabbat due to the prohibition of handling soil. 
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> attached </span>the basin <span class="gemarra-regular">to the ground, what of it? Wasn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> unripe </span>fig <span class="gemarra-regular">that one buried in straw </span>intended for kindling, so that it would ripen, <span class="gemarra-regular">or a cake that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one buried in coals </span>before Shabbat, and the coals were extinguished, <span class="gemarra-regular">if part of </span>either one <span class="gemarra-regular">is visible, it may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be moved on Shabbat. </span>This is not prohibited, although as a result one will move the straw or the coals, which are set aside. 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a case where the top of the basin <span class="gemarra-regular">has a rim </span>that is fully buried in the ground, so that removing the basin will dislodge the earth under which it is buried in a manner similar to digging, which is prohibited on Shabbat. 
The Gemara further challenges this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the basin <span class="gemarra-regular">has a rim, what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of it? Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who buries a turni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a radish </span>in the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">beneath a vine </span>for safekeeping, <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>

Daf 77b

<span class="gemarra-regular">some of the leaves </span>of the turnip or radish <span class="gemarra-regular">are showing, he need not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be concerned due to diverse kinds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., that he violated the prohibition of planting food crops in a vineyard, as he did not intend to commit an act of planting; <span class="gemarra-regular">nor due to tithes, </span>i.e., there is no concern lest the turnip or radish grew further, in which case he would be obligated to tithe it; <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the prohibition against working the land during <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sabbatical Year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and similarly, he need not be concerned that they grew further and that the additional growth is prohibited as produce that grew during the Sabbatical Year. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore, the turnip or radish <span class="gemarra-regular">may be taken </span>from the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Even if most of the turnip or radish is underground, it is permitted to pull it from the ground on Shabbat. If so, in the case described in the mishna here, even if the basin buried in the ground has a rim, it should nevertheless be permitted to move it.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>Rabbi Yeḥiel’s ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>in a case where the basin was so firmly attached to the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">that one would need a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hoe [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a spade </span>to remove it, as this action would certainly involve the digging, which is prohibited on Shabbat. Therefore, since the basin cannot be removed on Shabbat, it is considered fixed in its place and effectively diminishes the height of the wall.
It was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">An Egyptian</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ladder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is small, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not diminish </span>the height of a wall, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>larger, <span class="gemarra-regular">Tyrian </span>ladder effectively <span class="gemarra-regular">diminishes</span> its height. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances</span> of an <span class="gemarra-regular">Egyptian ladder; </span>i.e., what characterizes it? <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>scholars of the <span class="gemarra-regular">school of Rabbi Yannai said: Any </span>ladder <span class="gemarra-regular">that does not have four rungs. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, said to Rav Ashi: What is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an Egyptian ladder does not diminish </span>the height of a wall? He <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Did you not hear </span>that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Adda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is an object</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that may be moved on Shabbat, </span>i.e., it is not set-aside [<span class="it-text">muktze</span>], <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the principle is that <span class="gemarra-regular">any</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> object that may be moved on Shabbat does not diminish</span> the height of a wall, as it cannot be considered a permanent part of the wall.
The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>this should apply <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span> to <span class="gemarra-regular">a Tyrian </span>ladder <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>as a large ladder is also not set-aside and may be handled on Shabbat. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of a Tyrian ladder, <span class="gemarra-regular">its heaviness establishes it </span>as part of the wall. Even though one is permitted to move it, since due to its weight it is not moved easily, it effectively diminishes the height of the wall. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a wall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> between two courtyards </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths high, and one placed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a ladder four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide </span>against the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">on one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> side, </span>in one courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">ladder four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the other side</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in the other courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there are less than three handbreadths between them, </span>i.e., the two ladders on the opposite sides of the wall are within three handbreadths of each other, even if they are not directly opposite each other, this <span class="gemarra-regular">diminishes </span>the height of the wall. The pair of ladders is regarded as a valid passageway between the two courtyards. However, if the gap between the two ladders is <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths or more, this <span class="gemarra-regular">does not diminish </span>the height of the wall. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we only said </span>this qualification if the <span class="gemarra-regular">wall was less than four </span>handbreadths wide. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">wall was </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths wide, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if one ladder was <span class="gemarra-regular">greatly distanced </span>from the other, this <span class="gemarra-regular">likewise </span>renders it permitted. Since it is possible to walk along the thickness of the wall, the pair of ladders constitutes a passageway between the two courtyards.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai bar Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: If one built a </span>wooden <span class="gemarra-regular">platform </span>next to the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">platform</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">if the lower platform </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is four </span>handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">it diminishes </span>the height of the wall to below ten handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the lower </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">is not four </span>handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the upper </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there is </span>a gap of <span class="gemarra-regular">less </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">between them, it diminishes </span>the height of the wall, as the two platforms are considered as one. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a ladder whose rungs are disconnected</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if the bottom rung is four </span>handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">diminishes </span>the height of the wall. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the bottom </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rung is not four </span>handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the upper rung </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is four </span>handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there is </span>a gap of <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">between them, it diminishes </span>the height of the wall, because the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span> joins the two rungs together.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman said that Rabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Avuh said: </span>

Daf 78a

If <span class="gemarra-regular">a projection four by four </span>handbreadths in area <span class="gemarra-regular">extends from a wall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">placed a ladder of any </span>width <span class="gemarra-regular">against it, </span>if the rungs of the ladder are less than three handbreadths apart, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has diminishe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the height of the wall by means of this ladder and projection.
The Gemara qualifies this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one placed</span> the ladder directly <span class="gemarra-regular">against </span>the projection, so that the ladder serves as a passage to it. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if he placed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it adjacent to </span>the projection, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">widened </span>the projection, while the ladder remains separate from it. Consequently, the projection does not have any connection to the ground, and a projection that is not within three handbreadths of the ground does not diminish the height of a wall.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman said that Rabba bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Avuh said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a wall </span>between two courtyards is <span class="gemarra-regular">nineteen</span> handbreadths high, <span class="gemarra-regular">it requires one projection to </span>render the use of the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. </span>If there is a single projection in the middle of the wall, with a ladder of any width resting against it, it is considered a passageway between the courtyards, as the projection is within ten handbreadths of the top of the wall. 
However, if <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wall </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty </span>handbreadths high, it <span class="gemarra-regular">requires two projection</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>render the use of the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted, </span>one within ten handbreadths of the ground, and the other within ten handbreadths of the top of the wall. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: And this </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">where he positioned </span>the projections <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> directly <span class="gemarra-regular">one above the other, </span>so that it is possible to use a ladder to climb from one projection to the other.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a pillar in the public domain </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide, </span>so that it is considered a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one drove a stake of any</span> size <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>the top of <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he has diminished</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its </span>area. The usable area is now less than four handbreadths, and therefore the pillar is no longer considered a private domain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Adda bar Ahava said: </span>This applies only if the stake is at least <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high. </span>If it is less than three handbreadths high, it is considered part of the top of the pillar, based on the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span>. This is in contrast to <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye and Rava, who both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: Even if </span>the stake is <span class="gemarra-regular">not three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the pillar is no longer considered a private domain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for the opinion of Abaye and Rava? It is that the pillar <span class="gemarra-regular">is no longer </span>fit to be <span class="gemarra-regular">used, </span>as a surface of four by four handbreadths is suitable for use only when it is level. If it has even a small projection, it is no longer usable. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Even a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stake three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high </span>does not diminish the area of the pillar. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? It is that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is possible to hang an item on it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Although </span>it is no longer possible to rest objects on top of the pillar, it is still useful in some way.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: </span>According to your opinion, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he filled it entirely with stakes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., if he drove so many stakes into the top of the post that it was completely filled, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>?
Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Did you not hear that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said? </span>He said that <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit and its embankment </span>of stone around the edge <span class="gemarra-regular">join </span>together to complete the measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten</span> handbreadths. Similarly, the width of the embankment joins with the diameter of the pit to complete the measure of four by four handbreadths necessary to define the pit as a private domain.
There, too, one can raise the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">But why? He cannot use </span>the embankment, as most of the area is the empty space of the pit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what have you to say, </span>i.e., how can you solve this problem? The solution is <span class="gemarra-regular">that he places an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> item, </span>e.g., a board, over the mouth of the pit, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then he can make <span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>of it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, too, he places an item </span>over the stakes <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>can make <span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>of the pillar.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a wall </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths high, <span class="gemarra-regular">it requires a ladder fourteen </span>handbreadths high, so that one can place the ladder at a diagonal against the wall. The ladder then functions as a passageway and thereby renders the use of the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosef said: Even </span>a ladder with a height of <span class="gemarra-regular">thirteen</span> handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">and a bit </span>is enough, as it is sufficient if the ladder reaches within one handbreadth of the top of the wall. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Even </span>a ladder that is only <span class="gemarra-regular">eleven </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">and a bit </span>suffices, as the ladder will still reach a height of over seven handbreadths, i.e., within three handbreadths of the top of the wall. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: Even </span>if the ladder is only <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">and a bi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> it is sufficient, as he can stand the ladder upright against the wall. Since it will reach within three handbreadths of the top of the wall, the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span> applies. Therefore, even a ladder placed in this manner is considered a valid passageway between the two courtyards. 
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: An upright ladder </span>effectively <span class="gemarra-regular">diminishes </span>the height of a wall, as it creates a passageway. I received this teaching as <span class="gemarra-regular">a tradition, but I do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">know what the reason is, </span>as people do not generally climb ladders positioned in this manner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: Does Abba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., Rav, actually <span class="gemarra-regular">not know the reason for this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> matter? </span>The reason here is <span class="gemarra-regular">just as it is </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a platform above </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">platform. </span>Even though it is not easy to climb, since it provides steps that can be climbed, albeit with difficulty, it is considered a valid passageway.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya said: </span>The trunks of <span class="gemarra-regular">palm trees in Babylonia </span>that were placed next to a wall between two courtyards so that people could climb on them and pass from one courtyard to another <span class="gemarra-regular">do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not need to be established </span>permanently and attached to the ground; rather, they serve to diminish the wall as they are. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? It is that <span class="gemarra-regular">their heaviness establishes them </span>as connected to the ground. Although it is permitted to handle them, nevertheless, since their weight makes them difficult to move, they are considered fixed in place.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef </span>said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Oshaya said: Ladders in Babylonia do not need </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">established </span>and fixed permanently in place. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? It is that <span class="gemarra-regular">their heaviness establishes them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the ladders in Babylonia were typically large and heavy.
The Gemara comments: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who said </span>that Babylonian <span class="gemarra-regular">ladders </span>do not need to be fixed in place, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>would he agree that the trunks of <span class="gemarra-regular">palm trees, </span>which are placed there from the outset for this purpose, are considered fixed, as both are extremely heavy and also designed to remain in place. On the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who said </span>that the trunks of <span class="gemarra-regular">palm trees </span>need not be fixed permanently in the ground, spoke only with regard to palm trees. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">ladders, no, </span>they are not considered fixed in place. A ladder, even a heavy one, is designed to be moved from place to place.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef raised a dilemma before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba: </span>If there is a narrow <span class="gemarra-regular">ladder </span>measuring less than two handbreadths wide <span class="gemarra-regular">on one </span>side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span>similarly narrow <span class="gemarra-regular">ladder on the other </span>side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there are rungs of woven <span class="gemarra-regular">straw in the middle </span>between them which would not support a person’s weight, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Are the two ladders considered a single unit, forming a ladder four handbreadths wide, which serves to diminish the height of a wall? 
Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: The sole of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">foot cannot </span>climb <span class="gemarra-regular">upon them. </span>A person usually places his foot in the middle of a ladder. Since the middle of this ladder is made of straw, then although it appears to be four handbreadths wide, it is not fit for use and does not diminish the height of the wall. 
Rav Yosef continued to ask: And what if there were rungs of <span class="gemarra-regular">straw on one </span>side <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>rungs of <span class="gemarra-regular">straw on the other </span>side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span>narrow <span class="gemarra-regular">ladde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> less than four handbreadths wide <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the middle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and their combined width is four handbreadths? <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case? Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: The sole of the foot can </span>climb <span class="gemarra-regular">upon them, </span>and the ladder appears to be four handbreadths wide. Therefore, it serves to diminish the height of the wall. 

Daf 78b

Rav Yosef further asked: If the ladder resting against the wall was less than four handbreadths wide, and <span class="gemarra-regular">one dug out </span>grooves <span class="gemarra-regular">in the wal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> as extensions of the rungs of the ladder <span class="gemarra-regular">to complete </span>the measure, <span class="gemarra-regular">how </span>high must this hollowed-out section be to consider the ladder a valid passageway between the two courtyards? Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>If it is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths high and four handbreadths wide, it is considered a passageway.
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him:  </span>If there was no ladder, and <span class="gemarra-regular">one dug out the entire </span>ladder <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wall, </span>so that all the steps are grooves in the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">how much </span>must he hollow out? Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: </span>Those steps must reach <span class="gemarra-regular">the full height of </span>the wall. Rav Yosef asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the difference </span>in this case? Why must the steps reach higher in this case than in the case where the hollowed-out section was merely an extension of an existing ladder? Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: There, </span>where there is a ladder, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is easy to climb </span>to the top of the wall; however, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>where there are only grooves in the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not easy to climb. </span>If one cannot reach the top of the wall, the steps are not considered a passageway between the courtyards.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef raised a dilemma before Rabba: If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one designated a tree as a ladder, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Given that it is prohibited to climb a tree on Shabbat, if a tree stands next to a wall and it is easy to climb, is it considered with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of Shabbat as an opening in the wall that can serve as a passageway between the two courtyards? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the dilemma be raised </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, who maintains that a joining of Shabbat boundaries [<span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">te</span><span class="it-text">ḥ</span><span class="it-text">umin</span>] placed in a tree is valid; and <span class="gemarra-regular">let the dilemma be raised </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who disagree. 
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let the dilemma be raised </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the previously stated opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated there </span>that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anything that is </span>prohibited on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">due to a rabbinic decree [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shevut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">did not prohibit </span>it during twilight. Therefore, in Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion, it is permitted to use an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> that was deposited in a tree, as the use of a tree is prohibited on Shabbat by rabbinic decree. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">this applies only </span>in that case, as the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> takes effect <span class="gemarra-regular">during the twilight period. </span>Since there is doubt with regard to whether that period is considered day or night, the decree is not in force, and the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is therefore valid. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>in this case, where the opening must be valid for <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire day, </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>rule that the decree does not apply. Since it is prohibited by rabbinic decree to climb a tree on Shabbat, a tree cannot be considered a valid passageway. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>it may be argued that <span class="gemarra-regular">even according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>this tree is considered an opening. They may have said that a joining of Shabbat boundaries placed in a tree is not valid only because the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> must actually be accessible during twilight, and in that case it is not, due to the rabbinic decree. However, in this case, where it is not necessary to make actual use of the tree, they would agree that a tree that serves as a ladder <span class="gemarra-regular">is a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">entrance, but a lion crouches upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it. </span>Just as a lion crouching at an opening does not thereby nullify its status as an entrance, although in practice no one can pass through it, so too, in the case of the tree, the prohibition against climbing it does not nullify its status as a passageway.
Rav Yosef further inquired: <span class="gemarra-regular">If one designated a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tree worshipped as part of idolatrous rites [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">asheira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> from which it is forbidden to derive benefit, <span class="gemarra-regular">as a ladder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is it considered a valid passageway in the wall with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of Shabbat? Here, too, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the dilemma be raised </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">let the dilemma be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">raised </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis.</span>
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let the dilemma be raised </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the previously stated opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda only stated there </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted to acquire, </span>i.e., make use of, <span class="gemarra-regular">a house </span>for the purposes of establishing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> even if it is among the <span class="gemarra-regular">items </span>from which it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit, </span>such as a grave. This statement applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>with regard to acquiring an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in that location, <span class="gemarra-regular">since after the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has acquired </span>a place of residence <span class="gemarra-regular">for him, it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not important to him that it is guarded. </span>He requires the grave only for the moment of the acquisition of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, and what happens to it afterward is of no consequence to him. However, here, since one desires the continued presence of the ladder, it is possible that even Rabbi Yehuda would agree that one may not rely on an <span class="it-text">asheira</span>, as one may not climb and make use of it,  since it is prohibited to derive benefit from it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>it may be argued that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>though according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>it is prohibited to use a grave to acquire an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, here they would agree that the <span class="it-text">asheira</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">opening, but a lion crouches upon it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and this does not nullify its status as an opening. 
Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tree is permitted </span>for use as a ladder, <span class="gemarra-regular">but an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">asheira</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is prohibited. Rav Ḥisda strongly objects to this: On </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the contrary, a tree, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">which a Shabbat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition causes it </span>to be prohibited, <span class="gemarra-regular">should be prohibited, </span>so that it will not be said that a Shabbat prohibition has been disregarded in a case involving the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of Shabbat. 
And the converse is also true: <span class="gemarra-regular">An </span><span class="gemarra-italic">asheira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">which something</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> else, </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> unrelated to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">causes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>to be prohibited, <span class="gemarra-regular">should not be prohibited. </span>Rather, it should be considered an opening with regard to Shabbat.
Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was also stated: When Ravin came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said, and some say</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anything </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">which a prohibition of Shabbat causes it </span>to be prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited; </span>and conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">anything </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">which something else causes it </span>to be prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted.</span>
However, in contrast to Rav Yosef, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak taught </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as follows: </span>These questions are indeed dependent on the known disputes. Whether <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree </span>serving as a ladder constitutes a valid opening <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">a dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis; </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi permits it and the Rabbis prohibit it. The debate with regard to whether or not <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">asheira</span> is considered an opening <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">a dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who permits using items from which it is prohibited to derive benefit for the sake of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis, </span>who prohibit making an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with such items. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a ditch between </span>two <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">deep and four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is considered a full-fledged partition, and the residents of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one for each courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Even </span>if the ditch is <span class="gemarra-regular">filled </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">straw or hay, </span>it is not regarded as sealed and is therefore not nullified. However, if the ditch is <span class="gemarra-regular">filled with dirt or pebbles, </span>the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not establish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as the ditch is nullified and considered nonexistent.

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara wonders: Does <span class="gemarra-regular">hay not </span>constitute <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>proper <span class="gemarra-regular">filling </span>to seal the ditch? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn </span>in the following mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a haystack ten handbreadths</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> high </span>that stands <span class="gemarra-regular">between two courtyards, </span>the residents of the two courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not establish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This indicates that hay can create a valid partition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>that the matter should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">partition, everyone agrees that </span>hay <span class="gemarra-regular">is a partition </span>and that it divides between the courtyards as long as it is placed there. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to filling </span>the ditch so that it is considered sealed, one must distinguish between two cases: <span class="gemarra-regular">If one </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">nullified </span>the hay and decided to leave it there, <span class="gemarra-regular">it fills </span>and seals the ditch; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if he did not nullify it </span>but intends to remove the hay from the ditch, <span class="gemarra-regular">it does not fill </span>it, and the ditch is not considered sealed. 
It is written in the mishna: If the ditch is <span class="gemarra-regular">filled with dirt </span>or pebbles, it is considered sealed. The Gemara asks: Does this apply <span class="gemarra-regular">even if one did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not specify </span>his intention to leave it there? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we learn </span>in a mishna with regard to the ritual impurity of a corpse: If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a house that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one fille</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with hay or pebbles, and he nullified</span> the hay or pebbles and decided to leave them in the house, then the house (Rambam) <span class="gemarra-regular">is nullified </span>and is no longer considered a house with partitions? Generally, a house containing a corpse is ritually impure on the inside but does not impart impurity to the surrounding area. However, in this case, the house is considered an enclosed grave that imparts ritual impurity to its surroundings. 
And one can infer from the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nullified </span>the hay or pebbles, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>the house is nullified and considered sealed. 

Daf 79a

However, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not nullify it, no, </span>the house retains the status of a house, although it is filled with hay. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>tractate <span class="gemarra-italic">Oholot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? It is Rabbi Yosei, </span>and the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna does not accept his opinion. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>that mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>there is a difficulty, since <span class="gemarra-regular">we heard him </span>say <span class="gemarra-regular">the opposite, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it was taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>In a case where there is a house full of <span class="gemarra-regular">hay and </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">does not intend to remove, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is considered as though </span>it were filled with <span class="gemarra-regular">indeterminate </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dirt, and it is </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">nullified. </span>However, if the house was full of <span class="gemarra-regular">dirt </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he intends to remove, it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is considered as though </span>it were filled with <span class="gemarra-regular">indeterminate hay, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and it is </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">not nullified. </span>Apparently, the decisive factor for Rabbi Yosei is not the specific material in the house, but whether or not the owner intends to remove it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Rav Asi said: Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>tractate <span class="it-text">Eiruvin</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is Rabbi Yosei, </span>who does not accept the opinion of the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of tractate <span class="it-text">Oholot</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav Yehoshua, said: Are you raising a contradiction </span>between the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity </span>and the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>These two areas of <span class="it-text">halakha</span> cannot be compared. <span class="gemarra-regular">Leave </span>aside the <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition of Shabbat. </span>With regard to Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">a person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nullifies even a pouch </span>full of money. The pouch may not be moved on Shabbat and is therefore considered fixed in place. However, hay, which may be moved even on Shabbat, is not considered to be fixed in the ditch. With regard to ritual impurity, by contrast, the nullification must be permanent.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: And are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you raising a contradiction </span>between the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that governs <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">house </span>and that which governs <span class="gemarra-regular">a ditch? Granted </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a ditch, </span>it typically <span class="gemarra-regular">stands to be </span>permanently <span class="gemarra-regular">filled. </span>As there is no doubt that one’s intention is to fill the ditch, the assumption is that anything placed inside a ditch will remain there. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">house stand to be </span>permanently <span class="gemarra-regular">filled? </span>Of course it does not. Presumably, the hay and dirt will be removed. Consequently, additional proof is necessary in order to conclude that the owner of the house intends to seal it permanently.
The mishna states: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one placed a plank</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide </span>across a ditch that separates two courtyards, the plank is considered an entrance. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one placed </span>the plank <span class="gemarra-regular">along the width </span>of the ditch. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if one positioned a plank <span class="gemarra-regular">along its length</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the plank is of <span class="gemarra-regular">minimum </span>width, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>considered an entrance and reduces the ditch, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reduced </span>the opening <span class="gemarra-regular">to less than four </span>handbreadths. The ditch was originally only four handbreadths wide. Therefore, if one places a plank of any width along its length, it becomes less than four handbreadths wide and no longer constitutes a partition.
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> balconies </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite each</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> other, </span>and one placed a plank four handbreadths wide between them, the residents of the two courtyards may establish a single <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, as the plank is considered an entrance from one courtyard to the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: That which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you said: </span>If the two balconies are <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite each </span><span class="gemarra-regular">other, yes, </span>carrying between them is permitted by means of a plank; by inference, if they are <span class="gemarra-regular">not opposite </span><span class="gemarra-regular">each other, no, </span>carrying is not permitted in this manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">is above the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">other as well, </span>it is prohibited, as it is not an entrance because it is too dangerous to walk from one to the other by means of the plank. <span class="gemarra-regular">We</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>the prohibition in these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">only where there is</span> a disparity of at least <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">between this </span>balcony and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>balcony. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>a difference of <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">between this </span>balcony and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>balcony, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>is considered a single <span class="gemarra-regular">crooked balcony. </span>Two balconies separated by a gap of less than three handbreadths are considered joined, based on the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span>.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a haystack that is </span>positioned <span class="gemarra-regular">between two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> and is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths high, </span>it has the status of a partition, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore the residents of the courtyards may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">These, </span>the inhabitants of one courtyard, may <span class="gemarra-regular">feed </span>their animals <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> from one side of the haystack, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">those, </span>the inhabitants of the other courtyard, may <span class="gemarra-regular">feed </span>their animals <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>from the other side of the haystack. There is no concern that the haystack might become too small to serve as a partition. If the height of <span class="gemarra-regular">the hay was reduced </span>to less <span class="gemarra-regular">than ten handbreadths </span>across its entire length, its legal status is no longer that of a partition. Consequently, the residents of both courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and they do not establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s statement that the inhabitants of the two courtyards are permitted to place their animals next to the haystack and feed them, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: And </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that one does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">put </span>hay <span class="gemarra-regular">into his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">baske</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and feed </span>his animals. In that case, there is concern that one might inadvertently reduce the height of the partition to less than ten handbreadths, which would constitute a breach between the courtyards and invalidate both <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span>. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if the actual handling of the hay is prohibited, is it <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to stand </span>one’s animal next to the haystack and let it eat? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rav Huna say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">A person may stand his animal on </span>a patch of <span class="gemarra-regular">grass on Shabbat, </span>as he will certainly be careful not to pull out grass for the animal, due to the severity of the Torah prohibition involved. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">a person may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not stand his animal on set-aside </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> As the prohibition of set-aside is rabbinic in origin, he might forget and move the set-aside objects himself. The same reasoning should apply in the case of the haystack. If it is prohibited by rabbinic decree to remove hay from the stack manually, it should likewise be prohibited to position one’s animal alongside the stack.
The Gemara answers: The mishna is not referring to a case where one directly brings the animal and places it alongside the haystack. Rather, it is dealing with a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where one stands in front of </span>the animal so that it cannot go elsewhere, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it goes and eats </span>from the haystack of its own accord. In that case, the rabbinic decree does not apply.
The Gemara asks a question with regard to Rav Huna’s statement itself: <span class="gemarra-regular">And may one not put hay into his basket </span>and feed his animal? <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a house that is </span>positioned <span class="gemarra-regular">between two courtyards and </span>the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">filled it with hay, </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">do not establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as the hay is considered a partition that divides the house. The resident of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">puts </span>hay <span class="gemarra-regular">into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his basket and feeds </span>his animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>The resident of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">puts </span>hay <span class="gemarra-regular">into his basket and feeds </span>his animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">If the hay was reduced </span>to a height less <span class="gemarra-regular">than ten handbreadths, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">both</span> to carry in their respective courtyards.
<span class="gemarra-regular">How, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span>the resident of one of the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">act </span>if he seeks to permit use of the other courtyard to its resident? He <span class="gemarra-regular">locks</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his house and renounces his right </span>to carry in the courtyard in favor of the other person. Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited </span>for him to carry from his house into the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is permitted </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>resident to do so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And you say likewise with regard to a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pit [ </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gov</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of ha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>is positioned <span class="gemarra-regular">between two Shabbat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">limits. </span>The residents of each area may feed their animals from the common hay, as there is no concern lest the animals go beyond the limit. <span class="gemarra-regular">In any case, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: </span>The resident of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">puts </span>hay <span class="gemarra-regular">into his basket and feeds </span>his animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the resident of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">puts </span>hay <span class="gemarra-regular">into his basket and feeds</span> his animal. This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> poses a difficulty to Rav Huna’s opinion. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a house, since it has walls and a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ceiling, when </span>the height of the haystack <span class="gemarra-regular">is reduced the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> matter is conspicuous. </span>The height disparity between the haystack and the ceiling is obvious. Consequently, when the haystack is reduced to less than ten handbreadths, people will stop carrying in the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>however, with regard to the hay in the pit, the difference in height <span class="gemarra-regular">is not conspicuous. </span>The height of the hay in the pit could become diminished to the extent that the partition is nullified without anyone noticing. 
It is stated in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the height of <span class="gemarra-regular">the hay was reduced </span>to less <span class="gemarra-regular">than ten handbreadths </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry in <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>courtyards. The Gemara infers from the phrasing of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If the hay was at least <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths high, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to carry there, even though the <span class="gemarra-regular">ceiling is much higher </span>than the hay. <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from it </span>that the legal <span class="gemarra-regular">status of </span>ten-handbreadth <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions that do not reach the ceiling is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that of </span>standard <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions, </span>which was the subject of a dispute elsewhere. Apparently, this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> proves that they have the status of partitions in all respects.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Here, we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are dealing with </span>the case of a <span class="gemarra-regular">house </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">slightly less than thirteen </span>handbreadths high <span class="gemarra-regular">and the hay </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths high. The haystack is less than three handbreadths from the ceiling, and based on the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span>, they are considered joined as though the partitions reach the ceiling.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Huna, son of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yehoshua, said: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with a house ten </span>handbreadths high, 

Daf 79b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">hay </span>in the house is <span class="gemarra-regular">slightly more than seven </span>handbreadths high it is considered a full-fledged partition that reaches the ceiling, as objects separated by <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>gap of <span class="gemarra-regular">less</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">are considered joined, </span>based on the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span>. 
The Gemara comments. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye, that is why </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: </span>If the height of the haystack was reduced to less <span class="gemarra-regular">than ten</span> handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to Rav Huna, son of Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehoshua, what is </span>the meaning of: Less <span class="gemarra-regular">than ten? </span>Even at the outset it was never as high as ten handbreadths.
The Gemara answers: It means that it was reduced to less <span class="gemarra-regular">than the law of ten </span>handbreadths. As long as the hay is slightly more than seven handbreadths high, it is regarded as ten handbreadths high, in accordance with the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span>. Once its height is reduced to less than seven handbreadths, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a partition ten handbreadths high is no longer in effect.
The same <span class="it-text">baraita</span> taught that if the height of the hay was reduced to less than ten handbreadths, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry in <span class="gemarra-regular">both. </span>The Gemara comments: Should we <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from this</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">residents who arrive on Shabbat prohibit </span>the other residents from carrying? At the onset of Shabbat, both sets of residents were permitted to use the hay and the house, but once the hay was reduced on Shabbat it is as though new residents had been added to each of the courtyards, and it is prohibited for all of them to carry. Why not say that since at the beginning of Shabbat it was permitted to carry in the domain, they are permitted to do so for its duration? 
The Gemara rejects this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the hay <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">reduced on the previous day, </span>before Shabbat began. In that case, it was never permitted to carry at all. 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">How, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span>the resident of one of the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">act </span>if he seeks to permit use of the other courtyard to its resident? He <span class="gemarra-regular">locks his house and renounces his right</span> to carry in the courtyard in favor of the other person. The Gemara is surprised by this ruling: Does he require these <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>steps? One should suffice. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Either he locks his house or he renounces his right</span> to the courtyard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wish, say </span>a different explanation instead. <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, both </span>actions are required in this case, even though one of them would ordinarily suffice. The reason is: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since he is accustomed to </span>using the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">he will come to carry. </span>Consequently, the Sages were stringent with a person in this position and obligated him to implement an additional change so that he will not forget and come to carry when it is prohibited. 
It was taught in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one locks his house and renounces his rights to the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited </span>for him to carry, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>person to carry. The Gemara raises a difficulty: Isn’t this <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? </span>Why was it necessary to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the other </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">then renounced</span> his right in favor <span class="gemarra-regular">of the first </span>person. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">may not renounce </span>his rights in favor of the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">and then </span>have the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">renounce </span>his own rights in favor of the former. 
It was further taught in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And you </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say likewise with regard to a pit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of hay that </span>is situated <span class="gemarra-regular">between two Shabbat limits. </span>The inhabitants of each area may feed their animals from the common hay. The Gemara raises a difficulty: Isn’t this <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? </span>The same principle that is in effect with regard to a haystack between courtyards should apply here as well. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary </span>to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, who said</span> that the principle of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">let us issue a decree </span>and prohibit it, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">come to exchang</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> objects from one boundary to another, which would violate a Torah prohibition; therefore, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that no distinction is made between the cases, and no decree of this kind is issued.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">How does one merge </span>the courtyards that open <span class="gemarra-regular">into the alleyway, </span>if a person wishes to act on behalf of all the residents of the alleyway? <span class="gemarra-regular">He places a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">barre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> filled with his own food <span class="gemarra-regular">and says: This is for all the residents of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the alleyway. </span>For this gift to be acquired by the others, someone must accept it on their behalf, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> therefore teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">confer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">possessio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of his adult son or daughter, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of his Hebrew slave or maidservant, </span>whom he does not own, <span class="gemarra-regular">and by means of his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wife. </span>These people may acquire the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> on behalf of all the residents of the alleyway. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not confer possession by means of his minor son or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">daughter, nor by means of his Canaanite slave or maidservant</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because </span>they cannot effect acquisition, as ownership of objects that come into <span class="gemarra-regular">their possession is as </span>if those objects came into <span class="gemarra-regular">his possession. </span>Consequently, the master or father cannot confer possession to the slave or minor respectively on behalf of others as their acquisition is ineffective and the object remains in his own possession. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a barrel for the merging </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of alleyways, </span>the one acquiring it on behalf of the alleyway’s residents <span class="gemarra-regular">must raise </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">handbreadt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ground, </span>as he must perform a valid act of acquisition on their behalf.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: The elders </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Pumbedita, </span>Rav Yehuda and his students, <span class="gemarra-regular">stated these two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matters. One </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>mentioned above with regard to lifting the barrel; and <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>was: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who recites </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kiddush</span> over wine on Shabbat or a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he tasted a mouthful </span>of wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">he fulfilled </span>his obligation; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, if </span>he did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>taste a mouthful, <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not fulfill </span>his obligation.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥaviva said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>In addition to the aforementioned pair of teachings, <span class="gemarra-regular">the elders</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Pumbedita stated this too, as Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: One builds a fire for a woman in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> childbirth on Shabbat. </span>
The Gemara comments that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">thought </span>to infer <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: For a woman in childbirth, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>one builds a fire, due to her highly precarious state; <span class="gemarra-regular">for a sick person, no, </span>one does not build a fire. Likewise, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the rainy season, </span>when the danger of catching cold is ever present, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>one builds a fire; <span class="gemarra-regular">in the summer, no, </span>one may not.
The Gemara adds that which <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated: Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span><span class="gemarra-regular">blood and caught cold, one builds a fire for him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat, even during the season of Tammuz, </span>i.e., the summer. Clearly, Rav Yehuda’s ruling is limited neither to a woman in childbirth nor to the rainy season.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar said: This too was stated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by the elders of Pumbedita, as it was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>tree <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">presumed </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree designated for idolatry [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">asheira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> even though no one actually saw it worshipped. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: It is any </span>tree <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>idolatrous <span class="gemarra-regular">priests guard. </span>

Daf 80a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and whose fruit they do not taste. </span>This tree is evidently consecrated to the cult. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: For example, if they say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">These dates are for the beer of the temple of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Nitzrefei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which they drink on the day of their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then this is enough to establish the tree as an <span class="it-text">asheira</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar said: And the elders of Pumbedita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to me </span>with regard to this issue: The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara returns to Rav Yehuda’s ruling that the barrel used for merging the alleyway must be raised a handbreadth from the ground. The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">How does one merge an alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? One brings a barrel of wine, or oil, or dates</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, or dried figs, or any other type of produce </span>for merging the alleyway. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one contributed a barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">of his own, he must confer possession </span>to all the other residents by means of another person who acquires it on their behalf. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">is theirs, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he must </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">inform </span>them that he is merging the alleyway. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the one acquiring it on behalf of the others <span class="gemarra-regular">raises </span>the barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">a minimal amount from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ground. </span>Apparently, the barrel need not be raised a handbreadth. The Gemara answers: Here <span class="gemarra-regular">too, what is </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">minimal amount</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of which </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">spoke? </span>This expression means <span class="gemarra-regular">a handbreadth, </span>but no less.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed with regard to the acquisition of a <span class="gemarra-regular">merging of alleyways. Rav said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">It is not necessary to confer possession </span>of the food used in merging the alleyway to all the residents of the alleyway; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Shmuel said: It is necessary to confer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">possession </span>to them. They likewise disagreed with regard to a <span class="gemarra-regular">joining of </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries, </span>but the opinions are reversed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: It is necessary to confer possession </span>of the food to all those who wish to be included in the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Shmuel said: It is not necessary to confer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> possession </span>to them.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, </span>his reasoning is clear, as <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to a merging of the alleyways, <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in the mishna that he must confer possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>with regard to a joining of Shabbat boundaries, <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not learn </span>that this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav, what is the reason </span>that he differentiates between the cases in this manner? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>the subject of a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> involving </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter-in-law of Rabbi Oshaya, who went</span> before Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">to the bathhouse, </span>which was located beyond the Shabbat boundary, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it grew dark </span>before <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span>was able to return, <span class="gemarra-regular">and her mother-in-law established a joining</span> of Shabbat boundaries for her so that she could return home.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the incident came before Rabbi Ḥiyya </span>for a ruling as to whether the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is valid, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>ruled that it was not valid and <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>her return. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, son of Rabbi Yosei, said to him: Babylonian, are you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so stringent with regard to an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? This </span>is what my <span class="gemarra-regular">father said: Any </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">where you have </span>the ability <span class="gemarra-regular">to be lenient with regard to an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lenient. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And a dilemma was raised </span>before the Sages: Did the mother-in-law <span class="gemarra-regular">establish the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>her daughter-in-law <span class="gemarra-regular">with the mother-in-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">law’s </span>food, and Rabbi Ḥiyya prohibited it <span class="gemarra-regular">because she </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not confer possession to her, </span>i.e., she merely prepared the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> but did not confer possession of the food, and an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> of this kind is not effective? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps she established the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for her with the </span>daughter-in-law’s <span class="gemarra-regular">own </span>food, but the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was invalid <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it was prepared <span class="gemarra-regular">without her knowledge?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">One of the Sages, named Rabbi Ya’akov, said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them: It was </span>personally <span class="gemarra-regular">explained to me by Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>that the mother-in-law <span class="gemarra-regular">established the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for her </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with the mother-in-law’s </span>food, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>Rabbi Ḥiyya prohibited it <span class="gemarra-regular">because she did not confer possession </span>of the food <span class="gemarra-regular">to her.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Ya’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">akov, son of the daughter of Ya’akov: When you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">go there, </span>to Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">take a roundabout </span>route, i.e., do not travel by the shortest path, <span class="gemarra-regular">and go </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the Ladder of Tyr</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and raise </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ya’akov bar Idi. </span>
Rabbi Ya’akov did so and <span class="gemarra-regular">raised</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a dilemma before him: </span>With regard to that incident, did the mother-in-law <span class="gemarra-regular">establish the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>her daughter-in-law <span class="gemarra-regular">from the mother-in-law’s </span>food, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>Rabbi Ḥiyya prohibited it <span class="gemarra-regular">because she did not confer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">possession </span>of the food <span class="gemarra-regular">to her? Or perhaps she established </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for her with </span>the daughter-in-law’s <span class="gemarra-regular">own </span>food, but the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was invalidated <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it was prepared <span class="gemarra-regular">without her knowledge?</span>
Rav Ya’akov bar Idi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The mother-in-law <span class="gemarra-regular">established </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for her with the mother-in-law’s </span>food, and Rabbi Ḥiyya prohibited it <span class="gemarra-regular">because she did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> confer possession </span>of the food <span class="gemarra-regular">to her. </span>Like his master and uncle, Rabbi Ḥiyya, Rav also maintains that possession of the food must be conferred upon those who wish to be included in a joining of Shabbat boundaries.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: We hold based </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on tradition that </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of them, <span class="gemarra-regular">joining</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> joining of courtyards</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and merging</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of alleyways</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is necessary to confer possession. </span>After issuing this statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman raised a dilemma </span>concerning an issue that was not sufficiently clear to him: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a joining of cooked foods </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tavshilin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which must be prepared in order to permit cooking for Shabbat on a Festival that occurs on a Friday, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> necessary to confer possession, or is it not necessary to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> confer possession?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">What is his dilemma? </span>Did <span class="gemarra-regular">he not hear that which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Rav Adda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a joining of cooked foods, it is necessary </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to confer possession</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abaye said to </span>Rav Yosef: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious that he did not hear </span>that ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">had he heard it, why would he have raised this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma?</span>
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Didn’t Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say, </span>with regard to a <span class="gemarra-regular">joining of </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not necessary to confer possession, and </span>Rav Naḥman nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is necessary to confer possession? </span>Perhaps here too Rav Naḥman did not accept Shmuel’s ruling.
Abaye replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can you compare </span>the two cases? <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, there, </span>with regard to a merging of alleyways and a joining of Shabbat boundaries, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disagree, and </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance <span class="gemarra-regular">with the stringency of </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">master and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stringency of </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">master</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., his ruling is based on both opinions. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, here, </span>with regard to a joining of cooked foods, <span class="gemarra-regular">if it is so, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span> actually <span class="gemarra-regular">heard </span>Shmuel’s ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">is there anyone who disputes</span> it? If one of his teachers issued an uncontested ruling, it is presumably an established <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A certain </span>gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">superintendent [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">turzina</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lived in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Zeira’s neighborhood. </span>The neighbors <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Rent your domain to us </span>so that we may carry on Shabbat. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would not rent </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. They came before Rabbi Zeira and asked him: What is</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if we seek <span class="gemarra-regular">to rent </span>the domain <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his wife </span>without her husband’s knowledge?
Rabbi Zeira <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Reish Lakish said as follows in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the name of a great man, and who is </span>this great man? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina. </span>He stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">man’s wife may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> without his knowledge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> According to this principle, the superintendent’s wife could indeed rent out the domain without his knowledge.
The Gemara relates a similar incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">A certain superintendent lived in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the neighborhood of Rav Yehuda bar Oshaya. </span>The neighbors <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: Rent your domain to us </span>so that we may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> and carry on Shabbat, but <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would not rent </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to them. They came before Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda bar Oshaya </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if we seek <span class="gemarra-regular">to rent </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from his wife</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? He did not have </span>a ready answer <span class="gemarra-regular">at hand. They</span> subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Mattana, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have </span>an answer <span class="gemarra-regular">at hand. They came before Rav Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said as follows: A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> man’s wife may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> without his knowledge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and the same applies to renting out his property.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Women who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">joined </span>the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">or merged the alleyways without the knowledge </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of their husbands, their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and their merging </span>of alleyways <span class="gemarra-regular">is not a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">merging. </span>How can Shmuel rule against an explicit <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? 
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case, where Shmuel said that a wife may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> without her husband’s knowledge, he was referring to a situation where the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">would prohibi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> his neighbors from carrying if he did not join their <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, and the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is therefore lenient, as a wife may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> on his behalf. However, in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that his wife may not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> without his knowledge, is referring to a situation where <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would not prohibit </span>his neighbors from carrying. 
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, it is reasonable </span>that this is the correct interpretation, <span class="gemarra-regular">as if </span>you do not say <span class="gemarra-regular">this, </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a contradiction between </span>this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel and </span>another ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel. As Shmuel said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one of the residents of an alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who was accustomed to join in a merging of alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">residents of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway, but </span>one Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not join in a merging of alleyways </span>with them, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">residents of the alleyway </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his house and take </span>his contribution to <span class="gemarra-regular">their merging of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">alleyways from him </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">against his will.</span>
The Gemara infers: If he was <span class="gemarra-regular">accustomed </span>to join in their merging of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>they may enter his house to collect his contribution, but if he was <span class="gemarra-regular">not accustomed </span>to do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>they may not do so. Clearly, it is not possible in all cases to compel a person to participate in a merging of alleyways against his will. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from it </span>that it is so.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">supports him. </span>The residents of an alleyway may <span class="gemarra-regular">compel </span>anyone who lives in the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">to erect a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> side pos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam for the alleyway. </span>This teaching indicates that with regard to these Shabbat enactments, a person’s wishes are not taken into account; rather, others may act on his behalf even against his will. 

Daf 80b

The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is different there, as there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are no partitions. </span>That alley is breached, and it is therefore fitting to compel its residents to establish some sort of partition, if only for the sake of protection. However, if there are partitions, one is not obligated to join in a merging of alleyways.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Another version </span>of this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">From the side it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the preparation of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> does not involve an adjustment to the alleyway itself, but rather it is a side issue. Consequently, an individual cannot be forced to participate in its preparation (<span class="it-text">Meir</span> <span class="it-text">Netiv</span>).
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disputed this issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said: One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">build a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> side post </span>from the wood of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">asheira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Although it is prohibited to benefit from the tree and it must be burned, setting up a side post is a mitzva, and mitzvot were not given for benefit, i.e., the fulfillment of a mitzva is not in itself considered a benefit. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">build a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>from the wood of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">asheira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara clarifies their opinions: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who said </span>that one may build <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span>from the wood of an <span class="it-text">asheira</span>, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, <span class="gemarra-regular">all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the more so </span>he would permit <span class="gemarra-regular">a side post </span>to be prepared from an <span class="it-text">asheira</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that one may build a <span class="gemarra-regular">side post </span>from an <span class="it-text">asheira</span>, Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi, spoke only of a side post; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, no, </span>he did not permit one to build it from an <span class="it-text">asheira</span>. The reason is that an <span class="it-text">asheira</span> must be burned, and it is therefore as though <span class="gemarra-regular">its size has </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">been crushed. </span>Consequently, a cross beam, which must be at least a handbreadth in size, may not be prepared from an <span class="it-text">asheira</span>. With regard to a side post, by contrast, a minimum width suffices, which means that even wood from an <span class="it-text">asheira</span> is fit, despite the fact that it is viewed as burned. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">If the food </span>in the barrel for the merging of the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">diminished </span>and was less than the requisite measure, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">add </span>a little of his own <span class="gemarra-regular">and confer possession </span>to the others, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he need not inform </span>them of his addition. However, if new residents <span class="gemarra-regular">were added to </span>the residents of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may add </span>food on behalf of those residents <span class="gemarra-regular">and confer possession </span>to them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he must inform </span>the new residents of their inclusion in the merging of alleyways.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the measure </span>of food required for a merging of the alleyways? <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the residents of the alley <span class="gemarra-regular">are numerous, food for two meals </span>is sufficient <span class="gemarra-regular">for all of them; when they are few, </span>less than a certain number, <span class="gemarra-regular">a dried fig-bulk for each and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">every one of them </span>is enough.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> statement said? </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the beginning</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>when it is initially established. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the remnants of an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>e.g., if the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> decreased in size on Shabbat, it remains valid if even <span class="gemarra-regular">any amount </span>remains. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in general <span class="gemarra-regular">they said </span>that it is necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">to join the courtyards</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> even though a merging of the alleyways was already in place, <span class="gemarra-regular">only so that </span>the halakhic category of <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">will not be forgotten by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the children, </span>i.e., so that the next generation should be aware that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> can be established for a courtyard, for otherwise they would be entirely unaware of this halakhic category. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna stated: If the food in the barrel for the merging of the alleyway diminished and was less than the requisite measure, one may add to it without informing the others. The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">are we dealing </span>here? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say</span> that he added <span class="gemarra-regular">the same type </span>of food that had initially been used for the merging of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">why</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> specify </span>this particular case where the food <span class="gemarra-regular">decrease</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in measure? <span class="gemarra-regular">Even if </span>the food <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">finished, </span>he should <span class="gemarra-regular">likewise </span>not be obligated to inform them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>perhaps it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two types </span>of food, i.e., one added a different kind of food that had not been used beforehand. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if it </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">decreased </span>in measure, <span class="gemarra-regular">no,</span> he should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>not be permitted to add to the merging of the alleyway without informing them. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the food </span>of a merging of the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">finished, </span>and he added <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> same type </span>of food to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he need not inform</span> the other residents; however, if the amount he added was <span class="gemarra-regular">from two types </span>of food, i.e., if the added food was different from the original, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must inform </span>them. The Gemara assumes that the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in effect even if the food of the merging of the alleyway only decreased in measure.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>that the mishna is referring to a case where his addition was <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">same kind </span>of food, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if you wish, say </span>instead that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">from two kinds. </span>The Gemara clarifies the previous statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>that it is referring to a case where his addition was <span class="gemarra-regular">from the same </span><span class="gemarra-regular">kind </span>of food, and <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">decreased? </span>It means that the food entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">crumbled away, </span>so that nothing at all remained.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say</span> instead that the mishna is referring to a case where his addition was <span class="gemarra-regular">from two kinds </span>of food, for if the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">finished, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> That is to say, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that he must inform the others is in effect only if the food was entirely finished, but if any of it remains there is no need to inform them of his addition, and he may confer possession of even a different kind of food.
We learned in the mishna: If other residents <span class="gemarra-regular">were adde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the residents of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may add </span>food for those residents <span class="gemarra-regular">and confer possession </span>to them, but he must inform the new residents of their inclusion in the merging of the alleyway. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheizvi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: That </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is to say, </span>i.e., we can infer from the mishna, that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda’s colleagues disagree with him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this statement, </span>that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may be established for a person only with his knowledge, <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to a joining of </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries; however, with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a joining of courtyards, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for another person either <span class="gemarra-regular">with his knowledge or without his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> knowledge. </span>Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion conflicts with that of the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna, who does not permit a person to be included in a joining of courtyards without his knowledge. The Gemara is surprised at this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> obvious </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree; </span>why did Rav Ḥisda find it necessary to teach us something so evident? 
The Gemara answers: It was nonetheless necessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ruling, i.e., that he must inform them, <span class="gemarra-regular">applies only to a courtyard that is </span>situated <span class="gemarra-regular">between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two alleyways, </span>in which case the residents of the courtyard may join in a merging of alleyways with whichever alleyway they prefer. Consequently, he must inform them with which alleyway he prepared the merging, in case they preferred to join the other alleyway. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard </span>that opens into only <span class="gemarra-regular">one alleyway, </span>the merging of the alleyway only benefits them and does not harm them in any way, and you might therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">say no, </span>that even the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna concedes that it is not necessary to inform them. Rav Ḥisda therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna maintains that he must inform them in all cases, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the measure </span>of food required for a merging of the alleyways? It then specifies different amounts when the residents of the alley are numerous and when they are few. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How many are numerous, </span>and how many are considered few? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: Eighteen people </span>are considered numerous. The Gemara registers surprise: <span class="gemarra-regular">Eighteen and no more</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> From eighteen upward. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is </span>the significance of the number <span class="gemarra-regular">eighteen </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he cited? </span>Why this figure in particular? The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yitzḥak, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav Yehuda, said: It was explained to me </span>personally <span class="gemarra-regular">by my father, </span>Rav Yehuda: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any </span>case where, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>one were to <span class="gemarra-regular">divide </span>the food of <span class="gemarra-regular">two meals between them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and it does not amount to </span>the measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dried fig for each and every one of them, these</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are the very ones </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> called <span class="gemarra-regular">numerous, and </span>in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">food for two meals suffices </span>for all of them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if not, these are the very ones </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> termed <span class="gemarra-regular">few, </span>which means food in the measure of a dried fig is required for each of them.
And Rav Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">incidentally teaches us that </span>food for <span class="gemarra-regular">two meals consists of </span>a measure equal to <span class="gemarra-regular">eighteen dried </span><span class="gemarra-regular">figs. </span>Consequently, if there were numerous residents in the alley, then eighteen dried figs, which is food sufficient for two meals, is enough for them.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">join </span>courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">and merge </span>alleyways <span class="gemarra-regular">with all </span>types of food, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">water and salt, </span>as they are not considered foods. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua says </span>that a different limitation applies: A whole <span class="gemarra-regular">loaf </span>may be used for <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a baked </span>product even the size <span class="gemarra-regular">of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, if it </span>consists of <span class="gemarra-regular">pieces, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not join </span>courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">with it. </span>However, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a loaf, </span>even one the size of <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">issar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">if it is whole, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">join </span>courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 

Daf 81a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s ruling concerning the foods which may or may not be used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> and to merge alleyways, the Gemara poses a question: This ruling is apparently superfluous, as we have already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">once </span>before in another mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a merging of alleyways with all</span> kinds of food, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for water and salt.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>This addition comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehoshua </span>in the mishna, who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a loaf, yes, </span>it may be used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>; but <span class="gemarra-regular">anything else</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, no, </span>other foods may not be used. Therefore, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may be established <span class="gemarra-regular">with all</span> kinds of food, not only bread.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish a joining of courtyards with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>kinds of food, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">one may establish a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">merging of alleyways with all </span>kinds of food. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with bread only with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to </span>an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard. Who did you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hear that said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">bread, yes, </span>it may be used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, but <span class="gemarra-regular">anything else, no, </span>it may not be used? It was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua, and </span>yet the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: With all </span>kinds of food. This proves that the phrase: One may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with all kinds of food, does not necessarily exclude Rabbi Yehoshua’s opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar bar Ḥana said: </span>It comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>a different aspect of the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua, as </span>Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">said: A whole </span>loaf, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>it is fit to be used as an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, but <span class="gemarra-regular">a broken </span>loaf, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>it is not suitable for this purpose. The mishna therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us </span>that one may prepare an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with all </span>kinds of bread, even a broken loaf. 
The Gemara analyzes Rabbi Yehoshua’s position itself: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to a <span class="gemarra-regular">broken</span> loaf of bread, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>that it may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shaul said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>potential <span class="gemarra-regular">enmity </span>between neighbors. To avoid a situation where one person says to the other: You contributed a mere slice of bread, while I donated an entire loaf, the Sages instituted that each person should provide a whole loaf.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">they all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> established </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with broken </span>loaves of bread, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? In this case there is no cause for enmity. Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>There is nonetheless a concern <span class="gemarra-regular">lest the problem recur, </span>as one of them might give an entire loaf and proceed to complain about his neighbor who donated only a partial loaf. 
A portion of dough, known as <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span>, must be set aside and given to the priests. If <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> was not set aside from the dough, it must be separated from the baked bread. Moreover, if one part <span class="it-text">teruma</span> fell into a hundred parts non-sacred produce, a proportionate amount must be removed from the mixture and given to a priest, after which the remainder may be eaten. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Shaul said: If one removed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the loaf <span class="gemarra-regular">as much as </span>must be set aside for <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, or as much as </span>must be separated <span class="gemarra-regular">from a mixtur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and non-sacred produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>that loaf. The reason is that in this case people would not complain that he did not give a whole loaf, as they would assume the loaf had a small part missing because <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> had been separated from it, or because <span class="it-text">teruma</span> had fallen into the dough, which necessitated the separation of a certain portion. However, if more than this amount was missing, people would suspect him of eating from the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it was taught </span>otherwise in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If a loaf was missing <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">much as </span>must be removed <span class="gemarra-regular">from a mixture </span>of <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and non-sacred produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it, </span>but if it was missing <span class="gemarra-regular">as much as </span>must be removed for <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, one may not establish an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as the two sources are not dealing with the same amounts. In <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case, where the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> permitted a loaf that was missing the amount that must be removed for <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span>, he is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">baker’s </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is a smaller amount and is therefore not considered a significant reduction of the loaf. However, in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, where the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> did not permit a loaf that was lacking the amount that must be removed for <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span>, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to an </span>ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">homeowner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> portion is larger in size, and consequently the loaf may not be used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> if it is missing such a large amount.
The Gemara explains that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The measure</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span> fixed by the Sages is <span class="gemarra-regular">one twenty-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">fourth </span>of the dough. Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who prepares dough for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> himself or dough for his son’s </span>wedding <span class="gemarra-regular">feast, </span>the measure for <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">one twenty-fourth. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">a baker</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who prepares </span>dough <span class="gemarra-regular">for sale in the market, and likewise</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a woman who prepares </span>dough <span class="gemarra-regular">for sale in the market</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>is required to separate only <span class="gemarra-regular">one forty-eighth </span>of the dough, as the Sages were lenient with those who sell their wares so that they should not suffer loss.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">connected </span>the two portions of a broken loaf <span class="gemarra-regular">with a </span>wood <span class="gemarra-regular">chip</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with it, </span>as it looks whole. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to a case of this kind that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not establish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with it? </span>The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>as in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case, where it may not be used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, we are dealing with a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where the seam is conspicuous; </span>however, in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, where it may be used for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, the reference is to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where the seam is not conspicuous.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> even <span class="gemarra-regular">with rice bread or with millet bread. Mar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ukva said: </span>This ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">was explained to me by Mar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shmuel </span>himself. <span class="gemarra-regular">With rice bread one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but with millet bread one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as it is difficult to bake edible bread out of millet.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with lentil bread</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? </span>Is such bread edible? <span class="gemarra-regular">But there was that </span>lentil bread <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> days of Mar Shmuel, which he threw to his dog</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">it would not eat it. </span>Clearly, lentil bread is not fit for human consumption.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>bread which the dog refused to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span> a mixture of <span class="gemarra-regular">various types </span>of grain. It was baked in order to discover the taste of a bread of mixed ingredients and was similar to that which the prophet Ezekiel was commanded to eat, as it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Take you for yourself wheat, and barley, and beans, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lentils, and millet, and spelt, </span>and put them in one vessel, and make them for yourself into bread” (Ezekiel 4:9). This bread is unfit for human consumption, as even a dog at times will not eat it. However, bread prepared from lentils alone is edible. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: That </span>bread of Ezekiel’s <span class="gemarra-regular">was roasted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in human excrement, as it is written: </span>“And you shall eat it as barley cakes, <span class="gemarra-regular">and you shall bake </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it with human excrement, in their sight” </span>(Ezekiel 4:12).
Having mentioned this verse, the Gemara asks a related question: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eat it as barley [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">seorim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] cakes”? Rav Ḥisda said: </span>The verse means that he should eat it <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>small <span class="gemarra-regular">measures [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">leshiurim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>not as a satisfying meal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Its preparation </span>must be <span class="gemarra-regular">like the preparation of barley </span>bread, coarse bread with regard to which one invests little effort, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not like the preparation of wheat </span>bread. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">give a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ma’a</span> coin <span class="gemarra-regular">to a grocer or a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> baker, </span>if they live in the same alleyway or courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>the grocer or baker <span class="gemarra-regular">will confer upon him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> possession </span>of wine or bread <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>a merging of the alleyway or <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>if other residents come to them to purchase these products for that purpose. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: His money did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> confer possession on him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the transfer of money alone is not a valid mode of acquisition and cannot confer possession. One must perform a valid mode of acquisition, e.g., pulling an article into one’s possession, to transfer ownership. 

Daf 81b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">concede with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">people, </span>apart from grocers and bakers, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>if one gave them money for the food of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">his money confers possession upon him, as one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for a person only with his knowledg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and at his bidding. With regard to a grocer or baker, the person giving the money does not intend to appoint the grocer or the baker as his agent and the money itself does not effect an acquisition, and consequently, he did not accomplish anything. With regard to anyone else, however, there is no doubt that he must have intended to appoint him his agent, and his act is effective. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: In what case is this statement said? </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a joining of </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries, but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a joining of courtyards, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for a person either <span class="gemarra-regular">with his knowledge or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">without his knowledge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">because one may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">act for a person’s benefit in his absence, but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one may not act to a person’s disadvantage in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his absence. </span>As a participant in a joining of courtyards benefits from his inclusion in the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, his consent is not required. However, with regard to a joining of Shabbat boundaries, although it enables one to go farther in one direction, he loses the option of traveling in the opposite direction. When an action is to a person’s disadvantage, or if it entails both benefits and disadvantages, one may act on that person’s behalf only if he has been explicitly appointed his agent. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer’s </span>opinion that one who gave money to a grocer or a baker has acquired possession of the food for the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? This ruling is difficult, as <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not </span>perform a transaction by <span class="gemarra-regular">pulling </span>the food into his possession, and one can acquire an object only by performing a valid act of acquisition. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Abbahu said: Rabbi Eliezer established </span>this acquisition so that it should be <span class="gemarra-regular">like the four </span><span class="gemarra-regular">time</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> during the year </span>that the payment of money effects acquisition, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">On these </span><span class="gemarra-regular">four times </span>every year, on the eves of Passover, <span class="it-text">Shavuot</span>, Rosh HaShana, and the Eighth Day of Assembly, one who paid for meat may <span class="gemarra-regular">force the butcher to slaughte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> an animal against his will. <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if his <span class="gemarra-regular">ox </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">worth a thousand dinar, and the customer has </span>paid for <span class="gemarra-regular">only one dinar’s </span>worth of meat, the customer may <span class="gemarra-regular">force </span>the butcher <span class="gemarra-regular">to slaughter </span>it, so that the buyer can receive his meat. The reason is that on these four occasions everyone buys meat, and therefore the butcher who promised to supply the customer with meat must give it to him, even if this causes the butcher a considerable loss.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, if </span>the ox <span class="gemarra-regular">died, it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> died at the buyer’s </span>expense. That is to say, he must bear the loss and is not entitled to get his dinar back. The Gemara asks: Why is this so? The customer <span class="gemarra-regular">did not pull </span>the ox into his possession. As he did not perform an act of acquisition, he has not acquired any part of the ox, and his dinar should therefore be restored to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Huna said: </span>We are dealing here with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he did pull </span>the ox into his possession.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, say the latter clause </span>of that mishna as follows: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the rest of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the days of the year, it is not so. Therefore, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">died, it died at the seller’s </span>expense. If, as Rav Huna claims, the mishna is referring to a case where the purchaser had already pulled the animal into his possession, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>must the seller suffer the loss? Since the customer <span class="gemarra-regular">pulled </span>it into his possession and has acquired it, the ox died in his possession.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said: Actually, </span>the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the customer <span class="gemarra-regular">did not pull</span> the animal into his possession. <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the butcher <span class="gemarra-regular">conferred possession upon </span>his customer <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of another </span>person, i.e., the butcher conferred possession upon the customer by instructing another person to acquire a dinar’s worth of the ox’s meat on his behalf, without having obtained his consent.
Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">at these four times, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">when it is for his benefit, </span>as everyone wishes to buy meat on these days, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may act for his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">benefit in his absence, </span>and the acquisition is valid. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the rest of the days of the year, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">when it is to his disadvantage, </span>as it obligates him in payment and he might have no interest in this purchase, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may act to his disadvantage only in his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">presence.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ila said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: At these four times, the Sages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">based their statement on Torah law, </span>i.e., they ruled in accordance with Torah law. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Yoḥanan said: By</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Torah law, </span>the payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>is an effective act of acquisition, which <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>movable property. Merchandise that is purchased with money is immediately transferred to the ownership of the buyer.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And why, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the mode of acquisition of <span class="gemarra-regular">pulling, </span>not monetary payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires</span> movable goods? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree </span>issued by the Sages, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span>the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>a buyer who has already paid for his merchandise: <span class="gemarra-regular">Your wheat was burned in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upper story </span>of my house, and you have lost everything. According to Torah law, once the buyer pays, he owns the merchandise wherever it is located. As this state of affairs can lead to fraud, the Sages instituted that only an act of physical transfer of the item purchased can finalize the sale. On these four occasions, however, the Sages ordained that Torah law remains in effect. Rabbi Eliezer maintains that this enactment applies to an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> as well.
The mishna stated: The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">concede with regard to all </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">people </span>that if he gave them money for food for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, his money confers possession upon him. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>included among <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">people? Rav said: </span>The reference is to <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span>ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">homeowner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> not a merchant, who was asked by someone to receive possession of food for an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> on his behalf, by means of the money that he provided.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise, Shmuel said: </span>The reference is to <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span>ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">homeowner. As Shmuel said: They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a baker, but an </span>ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">homeowner </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire</span> the food on behalf of another person. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said: They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case where he gave him <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ma’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but </span>if he gave him <span class="gemarra-regular">a utensil, he acquire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> the food for the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> by the mode of acquisition known as exchange. By handing over the utensil in exchange for the food of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, he acquires that food wherever it is located. However, one cannot perform the mode of acquisition of exchange with money. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">said: They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said to </span>the grocer or baker: <span class="gemarra-regular">Confer possession upon me; but if he said </span>to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on my behalf</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he clearly intended to <span class="gemarra-regular">appoint him </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">agent </span>to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> on his behalf, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is acquired </span>by means of his agency. 
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: In what</span> case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement, </span>that one may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> only with a person’s knowledge, <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies to a joining of Shabbat boundaries, but not a joining of courtyards. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>in this regard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not only that, but any place where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehuda taught </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with his </span>opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥana from Baghdad said to Rav Yehuda: </span>Did <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel state </span>this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">even with regard to an alleyway whose </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam or side post was removed </span>during Shabbat? Rabbi Yehuda maintains that it is permitted to carry in this alleyway on that same Shabbat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: I spoke to you with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the acquisition of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and not with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> partitions. </span>The <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of partitions are not considered part of the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span>, as they touch upon several areas of <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, only one of which is the issue of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. With regard to partitions, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is not in accordance with Rabbi Yehuda.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rava, said to Rav Ashi: </span>As it is stated that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is in accordance with Rabbi Yehuda, this proves <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that there is a dispute </span>concerning this issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi say: Any place</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where Rabbi Yehuda says when, or in what </span>case is this, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Mishna, </span>he intends <span class="gemarra-regular">only to explain the</span> earlier <span class="gemarra-regular">statement of the Rabbis, </span>not to disagree with them. Why, then, did Shmuel say that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, when according to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi he is merely clarifying the opinion of the Rabbis, and there is no dispute between them? 
Before addressing this question, the Gemara expresses surprise over the claim itself: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>do Rabbi Yehuda and the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">not dispute </span>this issue? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn </span>in an earlier mishna: If new residents <span class="gemarra-regular">were added to </span>the original residents of the alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may add </span>to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for those residents <span class="gemarra-regular">and confer possession </span>on them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must inform </span>the new residents of their inclusion in the merging of alleyways. Apparently, this <span class="it-text">tanna</span> maintains that one must inform them even with regard to a joining of courtyards. This ruling contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, which proves that there is at least one Sage who does not accept his opinion.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard </span>situated <span class="gemarra-regular">between two alleyways</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in which case the residents of the courtyard may join a merging with whichever alleyway they prefer. As their participation in the merging involves a certain disadvantage, for perhaps the residents of the courtyard would not want to establish a merging of alleyways with one alleyway and lose out on a potential merging with the other, it is necessary to inform them. 
The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rav Sheizvi say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said </span>with regard to that same mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">That is to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda’s colleagues disagree with him </span>over the need to inform the other residents about the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? This statement indicates that at least some Sages hold that the matter is in dispute, and not everyone agrees with Rabbi Yehuda.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Gemara resolves both difficulties together: 

Daf 82a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Are you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raising a contradiction between </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">one person and</span> that of <span class="gemarra-regular">another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> In other words, a difficulty cannot be raised from the statement of one <span class="it-text">amora</span> against those of another. <span class="gemarra-regular">One Sage, </span>Shmuel, <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that Rabbi Yehuda and the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree, and one </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that they <span class="gemarra-regular">do not disagree.</span>
The Gemara analyzes the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi cited in the course of the previous discussion. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter itself: Rabbi Yehoshua ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Levi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">any place where Rabbi Yehuda says when</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, or in what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">are these, in the Mishna, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>intends <span class="gemarra-regular">only to explain the </span>earlier <span class="gemarra-regular">statement of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis, </span>not to disagree with them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The term <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>indicates that Rabbi Yehuda comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">explain, </span>but the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">in what </span>case is this, indicates that he intends <span class="gemarra-regular">to disagree.</span>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>invariably a sign that Rabbi Yehuda merely seeks <span class="gemarra-regular">to explain? Didn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t we learn </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The following </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disqualifie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> by the Sages from giving testimony, as they are people who commit transgressions for profit: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who plays </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with dice [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kubiyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> for money, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lends </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">at interest, and those who fly pigeons, </span>i.e., people who arrange competitions between pigeons while placing wagers on which bird will fly faster. The reason for their disqualification is that those who play games of chance do not fully relinquish ownership of their gambling money, as they expect to win their bet. Consequently, one who accepts money in such circumstances has effectively taken something that the giver has not wholeheartedly handed over, and he is therefore like a robber, at least by rabbinic decree. The list of those disqualified from giving testimony includes <span class="gemarra-regular">merchants </span>who trade in the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Sabbatical Year, </span>which may be eaten but may not be sold as an object of commerce.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: When </span>is this so? <span class="gemarra-regular">When he has no occupation other than this</span> one, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if he has a </span>worthy <span class="gemarra-regular">occupation other than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this, </span>although he also earns money by these means, <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> person <span class="gemarra-regular">is qualified </span>to give testimony. Rabbi Yehuda maintains that one who earns money by means of games of chance is not a criminal or a robber. Rather, the reason why these people are disqualified from giving testimony is because they are not occupied in the constructive development of the world. As they earn their money without effort, they do not care about the monetary losses of others. Consequently, if they have any other occupation, they are valid witnesses.
The Gemara resumes its difficulty: According to the above principle with regard to statements introduced with the term when, Rabbi Yehuda’s statement should be understood merely as an explanation of the previous opinion. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught about </span>the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: Whether he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has no occupation other than this </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">or whether he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has a </span>fitting <span class="gemarra-regular">occupation other than this, this </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">is disqualified </span>from giving testimony. Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda is disagreeing rather than explaining, even though he introduced his statement with the term when.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That</span> opinion in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, with regard to those disqualified from providing testimony, is not the opinion of the Rabbis of the mishna. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who maintained that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon said </span>this opinion. The Rabbis of the mishna, however, agree with Rabbi Yehuda in this regard, and his statement serves to explain their position. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to naziriteship: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Rabbi Tarfon: </span>In a case where two people accepted a bet, with each undertaking to become a nazirite if he lost the wager, and a doubt arose as to who won, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither one </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">can possibly be a nazirite, as there is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>acceptance of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship without </span>clear and definitive <span class="gemarra-regular">pronunciation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> A vow of naziriteship is only binding if it was expressly pronounced, i.e., if it was clear from the outset that the person intended to become a nazirite.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Consequently, </span>it can be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">since he is in doubt </span>as to <span class="gemarra-regular">whether he is a nazirite or he is not a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nazirite, he does not submit himself </span>to and accept his vow of naziriteship. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, too, </span>Rabbi Yehuda disqualifies those who play games of chance from delivering testimony due to the fact that they are robbers. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the player <span class="gemarra-regular">does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> know whether he will </span>win and <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whether he will </span>lose and <span class="gemarra-regular">not acquire </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not fully transfer ownership </span>of the money with which he plays to others, which means that the one who gains from these games receives money that was not wholeheartedly given to him. He is therefore likened to a robber, at least on the rabbinic level, which disqualifies him from giving testimony. 

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">How does one participate </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the joining of Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries? </span>One who wishes to establish a joining of Shabbat boundaries for himself and others <span class="gemarra-regular">places a barrel </span>of food in the location he designates as their place of residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">and says: This is for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all the residents of my town, for anyone who </span>wishes to <span class="gemarra-regular">go </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">to a house of mourning or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to a house of </span>a wedding <span class="gemarra-regular">feast </span>situated beyond the Shabbat limit.<span class="gemarra-regular">Anyone who accepted upon himself while it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was still day, </span>i.e., before the onset of Shabbat, that he will rely on the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>to rely upon it; but if one did so only <span class="gemarra-regular">after</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nightfall, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to rely upon it, as the principle is that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> after</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nightfall. </span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: One may establish a joining </span>of Shabbat boundaries <span class="gemarra-regular">only</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the purpose of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., to enable the fulfillment of a religious obligation, but not for an optional activity. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>novel element <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he teaching us </span>by this? <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>this idea in the mishna from the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">For anyone who </span>wishes to <span class="gemarra-regular">go </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">to a house of mourning or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a house of a </span>wedding <span class="gemarra-regular">feast. </span>This mishna indicates that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may be established only for the purpose of a mitzva, e.g., in order to comfort mourners or to celebrate a wedding, but not for any other reason. 
The Gemara answers: This teaching is necessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that the mishna merely <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches the usual case. </span>Generally, a group of people would establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in order to walk beyond the Shabbat limit only for a special purpose, such as a wedding, but one might be permitted to establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> even for an optional activity as well. Rav Yosef therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may indeed be established only for the purpose of a mitzva.
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Anyone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who accepted upon himself while it was still day </span>that he will rely upon the <span class="it-text">eiru</span><span class="it-text">v</span> is permitted to rely upon it on Shabbat. The Gemara comments: Apparently, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from here </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>halakhic principle of retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">clarification. </span>That is to say, there is no halakhic assumption that an uncertain state of affairs can be retroactively clarified. A later statement or action cannot retroactively clarify one’s earlier intentions as though he had explicitly stated those intentions at the outset. For <span class="gemarra-regular">if there is </span>a halakhic principle of retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">clarification, </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> should be effective even if one relied upon it only after nightfall, as <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is retroactively revealed that he wanted </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">while it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was still day. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said </span>that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: </span>While it was still day. This phrase does not require one to make the decision to rely on the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> before Shabbat. Rather, the criterion for using the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> on Shabbat is whether <span class="gemarra-regular">they informed him or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they did not inform hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> of the existence of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> prior to Shabbat. In other words, if one knew about the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> while it was still day, he may rely on it, even if he decided to use it only after the onset of Shabbat, as the halakhic principle of retroactive clarification is accepted. However, if one was unaware of the existence of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> when it came into effect at the onset of Shabbat, the matter cannot be retroactively clarified.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi said: A six</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-year-old child may go out by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mother’s </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> As he is subordinate to her, he is included in her <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> and does not require his own <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Gemara raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A child who needs his mother may go </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">his mother’s </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who does not need his mother may not go out</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">his mother’s </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we also learned a similar </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: A child who does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">need his mother is obligated in </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> by rabbinical law, so that he will be trained in the observance of mitzvot.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we discussed </span>this mishna and raised a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">But who is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">child who does not need his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mother? The </span>Sages of the <span class="gemarra-regular">school of Rabbi Yannai said: </span>This is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>child <span class="gemarra-regular">who defecates and his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mother does not wipe him. </span>A child who can clean himself is considered sufficiently mature for the purposes of the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="it-text">sukka</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Any </span>child <span class="gemarra-regular">who wakens </span>from sleep <span class="gemarra-regular">and does not call: Mother</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> is obligated in the mitzva of <span class="it-text">sukka</span>. The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Can it enter your mind </span>that every child who cries: <span class="gemarra-regular">Mother </span>is considered to be one who needs his mother? Much <span class="gemarra-regular">older </span>children <span class="gemarra-regular">also call </span>out to their mothers for assistance when they awaken. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> includes <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>child <span class="gemarra-regular">who wakens from sleep and does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>persistently <span class="gemarra-regular">call: Mother, Mother. </span>A minor who arises only when his mother comes is classified as one who needs his mother.
The Gemara continues. The Sages who discussed the mishna asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>at <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>age is a child no longer considered to be in need of his mother? Such a child is <span class="gemarra-regular">one about four </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">about five </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">old, </span>as some children become independent of their mothers earlier than others. This poses a difficulty to the opinion of Rav Asi, who maintains that even a six-year-old child is considered to be in need of his mother, and may go out by means of his mother’s <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. 

Daf 82b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehoshua, son of Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Idi, said </span>in answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Asi said </span>that this child may go out by means of his mother’s <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, he was referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where his father</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on his behalf to the north, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his mother </span>prepared an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> on his behalf <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> south, as even a six-year-old prefers the company</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of his mother </span>to that of his father. However, Rav Asi agrees that if they did not both establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for him he is not subordinate to his mother.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Gemara raises an objection</span> from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A child who needs his mother </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may go out by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">his mother’s </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> that she established for herself. Until what age may he do so? He can be <span class="gemarra-regular">up to the age of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">six. </span>This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is a conclusive refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehoshua bar Rav Idi, </span>who maintains that a six-year-old may go out by means of his mother’s <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> only if she established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> on his behalf as well? The Gemara concludes: This is indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">a refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi, </span>as here it states: Until the age of six, which indicates that he can be up to, but not including, six years old, whereas Rav Asi maintains that even a six-year-old is included in this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. The Gemara states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Asi </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you </span>that when the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Up to </span>the age of six, it means <span class="gemarra-regular">up to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and including </span>six years old.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us say </span>that this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">a refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yannai and Reish Lakish, </span>who maintain that a child in need of his mother is one who is up to age four or five. The Gemara explains: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here </span>Rabbi Yannai and Reish Lakish are referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the child’s <span class="gemarra-regular">father </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is in town. </span>As the child can go out with his father, he is no longer in need of his mother, even though he is younger than six. In contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">when his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">father is not in town. </span>The child therefore needs his mother until he reaches the age of six.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Our Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on behalf of his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">minor son or daughter, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">on behalf of his Canaanite </span><span class="gemarra-regular">servant or maidservant, either with their knowledge or without their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge. However, he may not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, neither on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">behalf of his Hebrew servant or maidservant, nor on behalf </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of his adult son or daughter, nor on behalf of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his wife, except with their knowledge.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught in another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on behalf of his adult</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son or daughter, and on behalf of his Hebrew servant</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or maidservant, and on behalf of his wife, only with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their knowledge. However, he may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on behalf</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of his Canaanite servant or maidservant, and on behalf of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his minor son or daughter, either with their knowledge or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> without their knowledge, as their hand is like his hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., their status and the domain in which they are located are determined by his status and domain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all of these who established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for themselves, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> at the same time <span class="gemarra-regular">their master established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them </span>in a different direction, <span class="gemarra-regular">they may go out </span>by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">master’s</span> <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wife, because she can object </span>by saying that she does not want her husband’s <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
The Gemara begins its analysis of the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> by posing a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">A wife, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>she <span class="gemarra-regular">different </span>from an adult son or daughter? Why can’t they object? They are also of age and under their own authority. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>The reference is not only to a wife; the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> is speaking of <span class="gemarra-regular">a wife </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and all who are similar to her </span>in this regard, such as a Hebrew servant or an adult son.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: These people may go out by means of their master’s <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for a wife, because</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> she can object. </span>The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason is due</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that she objected, but </span>if he established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> and she <span class="gemarra-regular">did not specify </span>her feelings about it one way or another, <span class="gemarra-regular">she may go out by</span> means of <span class="gemarra-regular">her husband’s</span> <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. The Gemara raises an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t the first clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">state</span> that he may establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only with their knowledge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? What, </span>is this <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>referring to a case where he asked them whether or not they want this <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, and <span class="gemarra-regular">they said yes? </span>It can be inferred from here that if his wife did not say anything, she may not use the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">No; what is </span>the meaning of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">Only</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with their knowledge? </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">that they were silent </span>and said nothing in protest. This comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they said no. </span>If, however, they did not object, they may go out by means of the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> of the head of the family.
The Gemara raises an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t</span> it taught in that same <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all of these who established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for themselves, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their master established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for them </span>in a different direction, <span class="gemarra-regular">they may go out by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">their master</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s </span><span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that is </span>referring to a situation when they <span class="gemarra-regular">did not specify </span>their feelings, as it does not state that they objected, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">states: Except</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for a wife, who may not go out </span>by means of her husband’s <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> clearly indicates that even if she did not object, the husband’s <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is ineffective for his wife.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Since they established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> in a different direction, <span class="gemarra-regular">you have no protest greater than this. </span>They need not register any other objection, as their actions prove that they do not wish to be part of their master’s <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the measure </span>for an joining of Shabbat boundaries? It consists of a quantity of <span class="gemarra-regular">food </span>sufficient for <span class="gemarra-regular">two meals for each and every one </span>of those included in the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. The <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> disagree with regard to the size of these two meals. It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s food </span>that he eats <span class="gemarra-regular">on a weekday and not on Shabbat; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>It is referring to the amount he eats <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat and not on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a weekday. And </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>Sage, Rabbi Meir, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>Sage, Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lenient</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as Rabbi Meir maintains that people eat more food on Shabbat, whereas Rabbi Yehuda believes that they consume more on a weekday.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says: </span>Food for two meals is the size <span class="gemarra-regular">of a loaf </span>bought <span class="gemarra-regular">with a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pundeyon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is one-forty-eighth of a <span class="it-text">sela</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">when four </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of wheat are sold <span class="gemarra-regular">for a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Shimon says: </span>Food for two meals is <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>of three <span class="gemarra-regular">parts of a loaf, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">when three </span>loaves are prepared <span class="gemarra-regular">from a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of wheat. In other words, the measure is two-thirds of a loaf the size of one-third of a <span class="it-text">kav</span>.
Having discussed measures with regard to a loaf of bread, the mishna states that <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of this loaf is the amount called a half [<span class="it-text">peras</span>], a measure relevant <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a leprous house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If one enters a house afflicted with leprosy and remains there long enough to eat this amount of food, the clothes he is wearing become ritually impure. <span class="gemarra-regular">And half of its half, </span>a quarter of this loaf, is the amount of ritually impure food that <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualifies the body</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, impure food of this amount imparts ritual impurity to the body of the eater, and disqualifies him by rabbinic law from eating <span class="it-text">teruma</span>.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">how much </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">food for two meals </span>according to the measures of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Meir? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: Two farmers’ </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">ikaryata</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">loaves of bread</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rav Adda bar Ahava said: Two </span>standard <span class="gemarra-regular">loaves of bread</span> baked in the region of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Pappa River.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said to Rav Yosef, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rava: Your father, in accordance with whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he hold, </span>that of Rabbi Yehuda or Rabbi Meir? He replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">He holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meir. </span>Rav Yosef added: <span class="gemarra-regular">I too agree with </span>the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, because if </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with Rabbi Yehuda, a difficulty </span>would arise <span class="gemarra-regular">from the popular</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> saying: There is </span>always <span class="gemarra-regular">room for sweets. </span>It is generally accepted that one dining on delicacies eats more, and therefore, the amount of food in Shabbat meals is greater than that of weekdays, as they include more sweet foods.
We learned in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Beroka says </span>that one measure is the amount of food for two meals, while Rabbi Shimon established a different amount. A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And their statements</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are close to being identical. </span>The Gemara expresses surprise at this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are they </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">identical? </span>According to the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">four meals to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>He maintains that food for two meals is equivalent to a loaf that can be purchased with a <span class="it-text">pundeyon</span>, which is one-forty-eighth of a <span class="it-text">sela</span>, when four <span class="it-text">se’</span><span class="it-text">a</span> are bought for a <span class="it-text">sela</span>. As there are twenty-four <span class="it-text">kav</span> in four <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, a loaf purchased with a <span class="it-text">pundeyon</span> is half of a <span class="it-text">kav</span>. This means that each meal is a quarter of a <span class="it-text">kav</span>, or that there are four meals in a <span class="it-text">kav</span>. In contrast, according to the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon, </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="gemarra-regular">meals to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Rabbi Shimon maintains that food for two meals is two-thirds of a loaf equal in size to one-third of a <span class="it-text">kav</span>. By this calculation, one meal is one-third of a loaf that itself is one-third of a <span class="it-text">kav</span> in size, which amounts to nine meals in a <span class="it-text">kav</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥisda said </span>in explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka’s opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Deduct one-third for the grocer’s </span>markup, as he takes one-third as profit. This adds one half to the total cost.
The Gemara asks: Even after allowing for this adjustment, it <span class="gemarra-regular">remains </span>the case that <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>Rabbi Shimon, there are <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span>meals to a <span class="it-text">kav</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas according to </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan, although it suffices for more than four meals, there are only <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>meals to a <span class="it-text">kav</span>. According to the measure of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, each meal is two-thirds of a quarter <span class="it-text">kav</span>, i.e., one sixth of a <span class="it-text">kav</span>, which still leaves a considerable discrepancy between their measures.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>we must explain <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda, as he said: Deduct </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one half for the grocer’s </span>markup. If the calculation is based on the assumption that the grocer takes half the sum as profit, the two measures are indeed close.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">remains </span>the case that <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span>meals to a <span class="it-text">kav</span>, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>there are only <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>meals to a <span class="it-text">kav</span>, as each meal is one half of a quarter <span class="it-text">kav</span>, or one-eighth of a <span class="it-text">kav</span>. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which was stated </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their rulings are close to being identical. </span>Although their measures are not exactly the same, there is no great difference between them.
The Gemara comments: Nonetheless, there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> contradiction between </span>one statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda and </span>the other statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda </span>concerning the size of the grocer’s profit. The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">the homeowner provides the wood </span>for baking bread, and the grocer therefore marks up the price by one-third as compensation for his efforts. Whereas in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">the homeowner does not provide the wood; </span>the grocer is entitled to reimbursement for the cost of the wood in addition to the work of baking, and consequently he marks up the price by one half. 
We learned in the mishna that the time it takes to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>the loaf is the time it takes <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the clothes of one who entered <span class="gemarra-regular">a leprous </span><span class="gemarra-regular">house </span>to become ritually impure, and <span class="gemarra-regular">half of its half</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>of the loaf, is the amount of ritually impure food that <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualifies the body </span>from eating <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. 

Daf 83a

A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught</span> in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And half of one half of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its half</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> one-eighth of this loaf, is the minimum measure of food that <span class="gemarra-regular">contracts the </span>ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">foods</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And our </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in the mishna, for <span class="gemarra-regular">what reason </span>did <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not teach </span>the measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">the impurity of foods? </span>The Gemara answers: He did not state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">because their measures are not</span> precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">identical. </span>The measure for the impurity of foods is not exactly half the amount of ritually impure food that disqualifies one from eating <span class="it-text">teruma</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">How much is half</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peras</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Two eggs minus a little; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: Two large </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eggs, </span>slightly larger ones than average. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">measured</span> the amount of half a <span class="it-text">peras</span> after calculating the number of <span class="it-text">kav</span> in the <span class="it-text">se’a</span> brought before him, and found it to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a little more than two eggs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How much </span>is this <span class="gemarra-regular">little more</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? One-twentieth of an egg.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">In</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> contrast, concerning the impurity of foods, it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan and Rabbi Dosa said </span>that the measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg-bulk, which </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>is the amount that contracts the impurity of foods, is <span class="gemarra-regular">equivalent to it, </span>i.e., the egg, <span class="gemarra-regular">and its shell</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And the Rabbis say: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">equivalent to it without</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its shell</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> These amounts are not precisely half of any of the measurements given for half a <span class="it-text">peras</span>.
As for the issue itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rafram</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Pappa said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that clarifies the measure of half a <span class="it-text">peras</span> is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">the statements of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei, </span>a measure that is identical to that of Rabbi Shimon in the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Rabbis say: One and one half</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> large egg-bulks. And who are </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis? Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Beroka.</span>
The Gemara registers surprise: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious, </span>as Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka maintains that half a loaf is three egg-bulks, half of which is an egg-bulk and one half. The Gemara explains: The novel aspect of this teaching is not the amount itself; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">he came to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teach us </span>that the measurement is performed with <span class="gemarra-regular">large eggs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rav Dimi came</span> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: </span>A person named <span class="gemarra-regular">Bonyos sent Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">a measure [</span><span class="it-text">modya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>a place called <span class="gemarra-regular">Na’usa, </span>where they had a tradition that it was an ancient and accurate measure (Ritva). <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">measured </span>it and found it contained <span class="gemarra-regular">217 eggs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, from where </span>is it, i.e., on what measure is it based? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is based on <span class="gemarra-regular">the wilderness </span><span class="it-text">se’a</span>, the standard measure used by Moses in the wilderness, which is the basis for all the Torah’s measurements of volume, the difficulty is that a <span class="it-text">se’a</span> is composed of six <span class="it-text">kav</span>, where each <span class="it-text">kav</span> is equivalent to four <span class="it-text">log</span> and each <span class="it-text">log</span> is equivalent to six egg-bulks. This means that a <span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>equivalent to a total of <span class="gemarra-regular">144 </span>egg-bulks.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the Jerusalem </span><span class="it-text">se’a</span>, then the <span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">173 </span>egg-bulks, as they enlarged the measures in Jerusalem by adding a fifth to the measures of the wilderness.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>it is a <span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of Tzippori</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as the measures were once again increased in Tzippori, where another fifth was added to the Jerusalem measure, the <span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is 207 </span>egg-bulks. The <span class="it-text">se’a</span> measured by Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi does not correspond to any of these measures of a <span class="it-text">se’a</span>.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>this measure is based <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span><span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of Tzippori, </span>but you must <span class="gemarra-regular">bring </span>the amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span> given to a priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and add it to them. </span>That is to say, although this measure is slightly larger than a <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, if it is used for flour and you deduct the amount due as <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span>, you are left with exactly one <span class="it-text">se</span><span class="it-text">’a</span>, or 207 egg-bulks. 
The Gemara raises an objection: The amount of <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, how</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> many </span>egg-bulks <span class="gemarra-regular">is it? </span>Approximately <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>egg-bulks, one-twenty-fourth of 207. Yet in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> remains less </span>than 217 egg-bulks, for even if we were to add another eight egg-bulks for <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> to the 207 egg-bulks, we would have only 215 egg-bulks, almost 216 to be more precise, which is still less than 217.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>you must <span class="gemarra-regular">bring </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">excess </span>amounts of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, the little more he included in his measure, <span class="gemarra-regular">and add </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them. </span>In Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s calculations, he did not factor in the <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> that had to be separated. Instead, the egg-bulks he used to measure the <span class="it-text">se’a</span> were small egg-bulks. Consequently, one-twentieth of an egg-bulk must be added for each egg-bulk. Since one-twentieth of 207 egg-bulks is roughly ten, the total amount equals 217 egg-bulks.
The Gemara raises an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, it is </span>still slightly <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>than 217 egg-bulks, by seven-twentieths of an egg-bulk, to be precise. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>more than 217 egg-bulks by <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>whole <span class="gemarra-regular">egg,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he did not count it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A Jerusalem</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is larger than a wilderness </span><span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one-sixth, and that of Tzippori is larger than a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Jerusalem </span><span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">by one-sixth. Consequently, </span>a <span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of Tzippori is larger than a wilderness </span><span class="it-text">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one-third.</span>
The Gemara inquires: <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-third of which </span>measurement? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">one-third of a wilderness </span><span class="it-text">se’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">now </span>you must consider: <span class="gemarra-regular">One-third of a wilderness </span><span class="it-text">se’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">how </span><span class="gemarra-regular">much is it? Forty-eight </span>egg-bulks, and <span class="gemarra-regular">yet the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>between the wilderness <span class="it-text">se’a</span> and the Tzippori <span class="it-text">se’</span><span class="it-text">a</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty-three </span>egg-bulks. As stated above, a Tzippori <span class="it-text">se’a</span> is 207 egg-bulks, whereas a wilderness <span class="it-text">se’a</span> is only 144 egg-bulks.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But rather, </span>this one-third mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">one-third of a Jerusalem </span><span class="it-text">se’a</span>, which is 173 egg-bulks, as stated above. The Gemara again examines the calculation: <span class="gemarra-regular">One-third of that </span><span class="it-text">se’</span><span class="it-text">a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">how much is it? Fifty-eight less one-third</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">yet the difference </span>between the wilderness and the Tzippori <span class="it-text">se’a</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty-three. Rather, </span>you must say that it is referring to one-third of a <span class="gemarra-regular">Tzippori </span><span class="it-text">se</span><span class="it-text">’a</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">One-third of that </span><span class="it-text">se’a</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">how much</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is it? Seventy less one-third, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">yet the difference</span> between the wilderness <span class="it-text">se’a</span> and the Tzippori <span class="it-text">se’a</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty-three </span>egg-bulks. The difference between the measures is not exactly one-third according to any of the known <span class="it-text">se’a</span> measurements.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabbi Yirmeya said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: Consequently, a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Tzippori </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is larger than a wilderness </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> by sixty-three egg-bulks, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">close to one-third of </span>a Tzippori <span class="it-text">se’a</span> of sixty-nine egg-bulks. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">third of it, </span>sixty-nine egg-bulks, <span class="gemarra-regular">is close to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">half of a wilderness </span><span class="it-text">se’a</span> of seventy-two egg-bulks.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina raised an objection </span>to the opinion of Rabbi Yirmeya: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">state </span>either: <span class="gemarra-regular">Close </span>to one-third of a Tzippori <span class="it-text">se’a</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Close </span>to half of a wilderness <span class="it-text">se’a</span>? The wording of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> indicates an exact amount. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Ravina said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: Consequently, one-third of a Tzippori </span><span class="it-text">se’a</span> together <span class="gemarra-regular">with the excess </span>amounts <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than half </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a wilderness </span><span class="it-text">se’a</span> of seventy-two egg-bulks by only <span class="gemarra-regular">one-third of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an egg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, a Tzippori <span class="it-text">se’a</span> of 207 egg-bulks added to the excess amounts of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi of one-twentieth of an egg-bulk for each egg-bulk amounts to a total of 217 egg-bulks, one-third of which is seventy-two and one-third egg-bulks.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Our</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sages taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: “You shall set apart a cake of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first of your dough </span>as a gift; like the gift of the threshing floor, so shall you set it apart” (Numbers 15:20). 

Daf 83b

What is the quantity of dough from which <span class="it-text">ḥalla</span> must be separated? <span class="gemarra-regular">The amount</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of “your dough.” And how much is “your dough”? </span>This amount is left unspecified by the verse. The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the amount of the dough of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the wilderness. </span>The Gemara again asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the dough of the wilderness? </span>
The Gemara responds: The Torah states that the manna, the dough of the wilderness, was “an <span class="it-text">omer</span> a head” (Exodus 16:16). A later verse elaborates on that measure, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written: “And an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">omer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the tenth part of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Exodus 16:36). An <span class="it-text">eifa</span> is three <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, which are eighteen <span class="it-text">kav</span> or seventy-two <span class="it-text">log</span>. An <span class="it-text">omer</span> is one-tenth of this measure. <span class="gemarra-regular">From here, </span>this calculation, Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that dough prepared from <span class="gemarra-regular">seven quarters </span>of a <span class="it-text">kav</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">flour and more is obligated in </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. This is equal to six </span>quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem </span>measure, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is five </span>quarter-<span class="it-text">kav</span> of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Tzippori </span>measure.
<span class="gemarra-regular">From here </span>the Sages also <span class="gemarra-regular">said: One who eats roughly this amount </span>each day, <span class="gemarra-regular">is healthy, </span>as he is able to eat a proper meal; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he is also <span class="gemarra-regular">blessed, </span>as he is not a glutton who requires more. One who eats <span class="gemarra-regular">more than </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a glutton, </span>while one who eats <span class="gemarra-regular">less than </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this has damaged bowels </span>and must see to his health. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If both <span class="gemarra-regular">the residents of </span>houses that open directly into <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard and the residents of </span>apartments that open onto <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">balcon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> from which stairs lead down to that courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiru</span><span class="gemarra-italic">v</span> between them, <span class="gemarra-regular">anything </span>in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">that is ten handbreadths </span><span class="gemarra-regular">high</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span>e.g., a mound or a post, is part <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">balcony. </span>The residents of the apartments open to the balcony may transfer objects to and from their apartments onto the mound or post. Any post or mound that is <span class="gemarra-regular">lower </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than this </span>height is part <span class="gemarra-regular">of the courtyard.</span>
A similar <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">an embankment </span>that surrounds <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or a rock: </span>If the embankments that surround a cistern or rock are <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths high, </span>they belong <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">balcony; </span>if they are <span class="gemarra-regular">lower than this, </span>they may be used only <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the inhabitants of <span class="gemarra-regular">the courtyard.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">are these matters, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that anything higher than ten handbreadths belongs to the balcony, <span class="gemarra-regular">stated? </span>When the mound or embankment is <span class="gemarra-regular">near </span>the balcony. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in</span> a case where the embankment or mound is <span class="gemarra-regular">distant </span>from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths high, </span>the right to use the embankment or mound goes <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the members of <span class="gemarra-regular">the courtyard. And what is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">near? Anything </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is not four handbreadths removed </span>from the balcony.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that if the residents of two courtyards established separate <span class="it-text">eiruvin</span>, and the residents of both courtyards have convenient access to a certain area, the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">through an entrance, and </span>the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">entrance, this is </span>similar to the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a window between two courtyards. </span>If the residents did not establish a joint <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, the use of this window is prohibited to the residents of both courtyards.
It is similarly obvious that if a place can be used by the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">of this </span>courtyard only <span class="gemarra-regular">by throwing </span>an object onto it <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>by the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">of that </span>courtyard only <span class="gemarra-regular">by throwing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>but it cannot be conveniently used by either set of residents, then <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>equivalent to the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a wall between two courtyards. </span>If there is a wall between two courtyards, it may not be used by either courtyard. Likewise, if a place can be used by the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">of this </span>courtyard only <span class="gemarra-regular">by lowering </span>an object down to it <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>by the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">of that </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>a similar act of <span class="gemarra-regular">lowering, this is </span>comparable to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a ditch between two courtyards, </span>which may not be used by the residents of either courtyard. 
It is likewise obvious that in a place that can be conveniently used by the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">through an entrance but </span>can be used by the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>courtyard only <span class="gemarra-regular">by throwing </span>an object onto it, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>governed by the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Rav Huna, </span>who said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>This place may be used only by those who have access to the area by way of an entrance. Likewise, a place that can be conveniently used by the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">through an entrance but </span>can be used by the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">of that </span>courtyard only <span class="gemarra-regular">by lowering </span>an object down to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>governed by the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sheizvi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who said <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rav Naḥman said: </span>This place may be used only by those who have convenient access to it. 
The ruling in each of the aforementioned cases is clear. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning a place that can be used by the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">of this </span>courtyard only <span class="gemarra-regular">by lowering </span>an object down to it <span class="gemarra-regular">and by </span>the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">of that </span>courtyard only <span class="gemarra-regular">by throwin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> an object on top of it? In other words, if an area is lower than one courtyard but higher than the other, so that neither set of residents has convenient access to it, which of them is entitled to use it? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>sets of residents to use it. As the use of the area is equally inconvenient to the residents of both courtyards, they retain equal rights to it and render it prohibited for the other group to use. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: </span>The use of the area <span class="gemarra-regular">is granted to those who </span>can reach it <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lowering, as </span>it is relatively easy <span class="gemarra-regular">for them </span>to lower objects to it, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">its use is </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">convenient; </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">for the others, </span>who must throw onto it, <span class="gemarra-regular">its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> use is </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">demanding. And </span>there is a principle concerning Shabbat: <span class="gemarra-regular">Anything whose use is convenient for one </span>party <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">demanding for another </span>party, <span class="gemarra-regular">one provides it to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">whose use </span>of it <span class="gemarra-regular">is convenient.</span>
In order to decide between these two opinions, the Gemara attempts to adduce a proof from the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">the residents of</span> houses that open directly into <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard and the residents</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>apartments that open onto <span class="gemarra-regular">a balcony </span>from which stairs lead down to that courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot and did not establish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> between them, <span class="gemarra-regular">anything </span>in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ten handbreadths high </span>belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the balcony, </span>while anything that is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than this </span>height belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara first explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">It might have entered your mind </span>to say: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of the <span class="gemarra-regular">balcony </span>mentioned in the mishna? 

Daf 84a

It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the residents of an upper story </span>above the balcony; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do we call </span>the upper story <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">balcony? </span>Because the residents of the upper story <span class="gemarra-regular">ascend </span>and descend to and from their apartments <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>way of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">balcony. From here </span>the Gemara infers: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>can be used <span class="gemarra-regular">by one </span>set of residents only <span class="gemarra-regular">by lowering </span>an object down to it <span class="gemarra-regular">and by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>set of residents only <span class="gemarra-regular">by throwing </span>an object on top of it, <span class="gemarra-regular">we grant </span>Shabbat use of <span class="gemarra-regular">it to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> those who </span>can use it <span class="gemarra-regular">by lowering, </span>as the residents of the upper story who use the area ten handbreadths high do so by means of lowering. Apparently, the mishna supports Shmuel and presents a difficulty to Rav.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Huna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>with regard to a different issue discussed in a subsequent mishna, that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to those who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> live in </span>apartments that open directly onto <span class="gemarra-regular">the balcony </span>rather than those who live in an upper story; <span class="gemarra-regular">here too</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">of those who live in </span>apartments that open directly onto <span class="gemarra-regular">the balcony</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In this case, the use of an area ten handbreadths high is convenient for the residents of the balcony, as it is on their level; whereas its use is relatively inconvenient for the residents of the courtyard. Consequently, the right to use this area is granted to the residents of the balcony.
The Gemara raises an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, say the next clause</span> of the mishna: Anything that is <span class="gemarra-regular">lower than this, </span>i.e., lower than ten handbreadths, its use belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> courtyard. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>should this be the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? This is similar to a case of residents of two courtyards who have equally convenient access to a certain area. The residents <span class="gemarra-regular">of this </span>courtyard access the area <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">entrance, and</span> the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">of that </span>courtyard access the area <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">entrance. </span>In our case, the use of the area is equally convenient for the inhabitants of both the balcony and the courtyard; why should the latter be granted exclusive right of use?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">to the courtyard? </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">also</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the courtyard. </span>In other words, even the residents of the courtyard can make use of this mound or post, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>the courtyard and the balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited. </span>If residents of two domains can conveniently use a single area and they did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> between their domains, they are all prohibited to carry in that area. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, it is reasonable </span>to explain the mishna in this manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the latter clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">case is this statement said? When </span>the mound or embankment is <span class="gemarra-regular">near </span>the balcony; <span class="gemarra-regular">but in </span>a case where it is <span class="gemarra-regular">distant </span>from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths </span><span class="gemarra-regular">high, </span>its use belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the courtyard. What, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> the meaning of the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">to the courtyard </span>in this context? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, and </span>therefore the use of the mound or embankment <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>to them, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>should this be so? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is the domain of </span>the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>the courtyard and the balcony, as the mound or embankment is positioned near enough to the balcony for its residents to use it as well.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what is </span>the meaning of the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">to the courtyard? </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">also to the courtyard. And,</span> consequently, as the residents of both the courtyard and the balcony can use it, <span class="gemarra-regular">both are prohibited </span>to carry there on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>in the earlier part of the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the meaning of the clause <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the courtyard? </span>It likewise means <span class="gemarra-regular">also to the courtyard, and</span> therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>sets of residents are <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from this </span>that this is the correct interpretation of this phrase. 
The Gemara attempts to adduce further proof from the mishna to resolve the dispute between Rav and Shmuel. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned</span> in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The embankments </span>that surround <span class="gemarra-regular">a cister</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or a rock that are ten handbreadths high </span>may be used <span class="gemarra-regular">by the balcony; </span>if they are <span class="gemarra-regular">lower than that </span>height, the right to use them belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara assumes that the phrase to the balcony is referring to the residents of an upper story, who access their apartments through the balcony. The mishna indicates that if one set of residents can make use of a place by lowering and another set of residents can use it by throwing, the use of the place is granted to those who lower their objects, in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel and contrary to the opinion of Rav. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said </span>that the phrase to the balcony is to be understood here literally as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> those who live in </span>apartments that open directly onto <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> balcony.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a rock, </span>the residents of the balcony can use it conveniently, as its surface is more or less level with the balcony itself. But with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern, what can be said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The water in the cistern is lower than the balcony and can be reached only by lowering a bucket down to it. How, then, can it be argued that the cistern is conveniently used by the residents of the balcony but not by the residents of the courtyard?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, said: We</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are dealing here with a cistern full of water, </span>as the water can be drawn from the cistern’s upper portion, near the balcony. The Gemara raises an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> doesn’t </span>the cistern gradually <span class="gemarra-regular">lose </span>its water as the liquid near the surface is drawn out? Although the water might at first reach the balcony, the water level gradually recedes. Eventually, the only way to reach the water will be by lowering a bucket into the cistern.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>to draw water from the cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">full</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is likewise permitted </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">when it is lacking. </span>The Gemara counters this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">On</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the contrary, </span>you should say that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited when it is lacking, it should likewise be prohibited</span> even <span class="gemarra-regular">when it is full.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Abaye said: Here we are dealing with a cistern</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> full of produce, </span>as the upper produce is near the balcony. The Gemara raises an objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t </span>the amount of produce also <span class="gemarra-regular">diminish, </span>as the produce is removed, increasing the distance between the pile and the balcony?
The Gemara answers: This teaching is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to untithed produce, </span>which one may not tithe on Shabbat. Since this produce may not be used, the height of the pile will remain constant for the duration of Shabbat. 
The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it teaches </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of an embankment of a cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">together with </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a rock. </span>Just as in the case of the rock only the upper surface is used, so too, in the case of the embankment of the cistern, the mishna is referring to the use of the surface of the cistern and not its contents. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from this </span>that this is the correct explanation. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if this is indeed correct, and the cistern and rock are similar in all respects, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I need </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to state </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">why do I need </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">to state </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a rock </span>as well? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary </span>to teach both cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">As had </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">taught us </span>only about <span class="gemarra-regular">a rock, </span>one might have said that only a rock may be used by the residents of the balcony, <span class="gemarra-regular">as there is no </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">to decree </span>in case its height is diminished. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">we should decree </span>and prohibit its use, as <span class="gemarra-regular">at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> times it might be filled with tithed produce, </span>which may be removed and eaten, thereby diminishing its height. It was therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach us that this is not a concern, and a cistern, as well as a rock, may be used by the residents of the balcony. 
Returning to the dispute between Rav and Shmuel, the Gemara suggests a different proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear</span> a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the residents of </span>houses opening directly into <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard and the residents of </span>apartments in <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upper story forgot and did not establish </span>an <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together, <span class="gemarra-regular">the residents of the courtyard may use the lower ten</span> handbreadths of the wall near them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the residents of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the upper story may use the upper ten </span>handbreadths adjacent to them. <span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a ledge protrudes from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wall below ten </span>handbreadths from the ground, its use is <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">of the courtyard; </span>but if it protrudes <span class="gemarra-regular">above ten </span>handbreadths, its use is <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the upper story.</span>
The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Consequently, </span>a ledge situated <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">and between </span>the other, i.e., in-between the courtyard and the upper story, <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This middle area has the status of a place that can be used by one set of residents by lowering and by another set of residents by throwing, and yet they are both prohibited, in accordance with the opinion of Rav and in opposition to the opinion of Shmuel.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>No proof can be adduced from this teaching, as <span class="gemarra-regular">here we are dealing with a wall of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nineteen </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">that has a protruding ledge. </span>If the ledge protrudes <span class="gemarra-regular">below ten </span>handbreadths from the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">for this </span>set of residents, those of the courtyard, it can be used <span class="gemarra-regular">as an entrance, and for that </span>set of residents, those of the upper story, it can be used only <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lowering. </span>If the ledge protrudes <span class="gemarra-regular">above ten </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">for this</span> set of residents, those in the balcony, it can be accessed <span class="gemarra-regular">as an entrance, and for that </span>set of residents, those of the courtyard, it can be used only <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> throwing. </span>In this case, there is no middle area between the ten-handbreadths available to each set of residents. Consequently, this case cannot serve as a proof with regard to the dispute between Rav and Shmuel. 

Daf 84b

The Gemara attempts to cite yet another proof to resolve the dispute between Rav and Shmuel. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a mishna: If a balcony extends over a body of water, and the residents of the balcony cut out a hole in the floor and constructed a partition ten handbreadths high around the hole, water may be drawn through the hole on Shabbat. If there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two balconies </span>of this kind, <span class="gemarra-regular">one above the other, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">they erected</span> a partition <span class="gemarra-regular">for the upper </span>balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">but they did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> erect </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">for the lower one, they are both prohibited</span> from drawing water, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless they establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> between them. This mishna apparently is referring to a case where the residents of the upper balcony draw water by lowering their buckets down, whereas the residents of the lower balcony hoist their bucket to the upper one and draw water from there, i.e., one balcony draws the water by lowering and the other by throwing. The mishna rules that they are both prohibited, in accordance with the opinion of Rav and contrary to the opinion of Shmuel.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ahava said: </span>Here we are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the residents </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">lower </span>balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">go </span>up <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upper </span>balcony by means of a ladder <span class="gemarra-regular">to draw </span>their water from there. Since they themselves are located in the upper balcony when they draw their water, both sets of residents gain access to their water by lowering.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>Here we are dealing with a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> the two balconies <span class="gemarra-regular">are situated within ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">of each</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> other, and </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was speaking </span>in the style of: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is no need. </span>In other words, the mishna should be understood in the following manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is no need</span> to say that if <span class="gemarra-regular">they erect </span>a partition <span class="gemarra-regular">for the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lower </span>balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">but they did not erect </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">for the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upper one, they are </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to draw water. The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that since they are positioned within ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">of each other, they </span>render it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited for one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>anyway.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is the same <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">established </span>a partition for the <span class="gemarra-regular">upper </span>balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">and they did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not establish </span>a partition <span class="gemarra-regular">for the lower </span>one, despite the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">it might have entered your mind to say </span>the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since for this, </span>the residents of the upper balcony, its use <span class="gemarra-regular">is convenient, while for that </span>lower balcony, its use <span class="gemarra-regular">is demanding, </span>as the lower balcony can draw water only by hoisting its bucket upward, the use of the hole <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">be granted to the one whose </span><span class="gemarra-regular">use is convenient. </span>This reasoning would render the hole permitted to the upper balcony and prohibited to the lower balcony. To counter this hypothetical argument, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the upper and lower balconies <span class="gemarra-regular">are located within ten </span>handbreadths of each other, they render it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited for one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another.</span>
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>a teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a roof that is adjacent</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there must be a fixed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ladder </span>from the courtyard to the roof <span class="gemarra-regular">to permit </span>the use of the roof to the residents of the courtyard. The Gemara infers: If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a fixed ladder, yes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the residents of the courtyard may use the roof; if there is merely <span class="gemarra-regular">a temporary ladder, no, </span>they are prohibited to use it. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this distinction? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>that since the balcony and the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">are situated within ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">of each other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the residents of both render it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited for one another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in accordance with the opinion of Abaye? Since the residents of the balcony are located within ten handbreadths of the public domain, the presence of people in the public domain renders the use of the roof prohibited for the inhabitants of the balcony. The only way for the members of the balcony to be permitted to use the roof is by means of a fixed ladder that has the status of a proper door.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa </span>strongly <span class="gemarra-regular">objected to this </span>argument, claiming that this proof can be refuted: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps </span>this applies only to a roof upon which <span class="gemarra-regular">many people place</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their hats [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kumta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and shawls </span>when they are in need of rest. Even if the people in the public domain are not situated within ten handbreadths of the roof, they can still use it conveniently if they wish to place light objects upon it on a temporary basis. If there was not a fixed ladder, the residents of the courtyard would not be permitted to use the roof, as it serves the public domain as well. Consequently, no proof can be adduced from here either. In summary, no compelling proof has been found either for Rav’s opinion or for Shmuel’s opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>

Daf 85a

If <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern </span>in a small alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">between two courtyards is separated </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wall </span>of one courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wall </span>of another courtyard, the resident of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> extend a ledge of minimal size </span>from his window in the direction of the cistern, as a sign that he is not using the domain of the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he may </span>subsequently proceed to <span class="gemarra-regular">draw </span>water from the cistern through the window. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span>resident of the <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">extend a ledge of minimal size and draw </span>water from the cistern through his widow. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> himself said: </span>An actual ledge is unnecessary, as it is enough <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if one merely extends <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> simple <span class="gemarra-regular">reed.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav Yosef: This </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that some minimal sort of adjustment is required, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of his teacher, <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Since if </span>he holds in accordance with the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>his other teacher, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, </span>this would present a difficulty, <span class="gemarra-regular">as didn’t </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">say: One person does not render </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it prohibited for another person </span>to perform an action <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">way of the air</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if the place he is using is four handbreadths away from him? Consequently, not even a reed is required.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>is it ascertained that this is the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel? If you say </span>we learn it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to a low <span class="gemarra-regular">roof adjacent to a public domain, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there must be a fixed ladder </span>from the courtyard to the roof in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to permit </span>the use of the roof to the residents of the courtyard, it might be inferred from here that the people in the public domain render it prohibited to use the roof because they can use it through the air, by throwing. However, this proof is inconclusive. <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps, </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> can be understood <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with the opinion of Rav Pappa: </span>Here we are dealing with a roof upon which people in the public domain place their hats and shawls when in need of rest. That would mean that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> does not involve use of the airspace at all.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Shmuel’s opinion is learned <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>one, the resident of one courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> extend a ledge of minimal size and draw </span>water from the cistern through his window; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span>resident of the <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">extend a ledge of minimal size</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and draw </span>water through his window. <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is that one extended </span>a ledge, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not extend </span>a ledge, <span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> renders it prohibited for another person by way of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> air. </span>One resident would be prohibited to draw water from the cistern due to the other resident, who has equal access to the water in the cistern by way of the air.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>is the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav </span>learned, that one person does not render it prohibited for another by way of the air? <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you say </span>it is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from that </span>which was taught in a mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">two balconies </span>extend over a body of water, <span class="gemarra-regular">one above the other, </span>and the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">erected</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a partition for the upper </span>balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">but they did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> erect a partition for the lower one, </span>residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">both</span> balconies <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited </span>to draw water, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless they established an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together.
The Gemara continues. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Huna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: They taught </span>that the residents of one balcony render it prohibited for the residents of the other balcony to draw water <span class="gemarra-regular">only when </span>one balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">is near </span>the other, i.e., horizontally within four handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if each balcony is <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">removed </span>from the other, so that each can use the other only by means of the air, <span class="gemarra-regular">the upper </span>balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>to draw water, <span class="gemarra-regular">while the lower one is prohibited </span>to do so. This teaching indicates that one person does not render it prohibited for use by another by way of the air.
However, this proof is inconclusive, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is different here, since for the </span>residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>lower balcony, their use of the area is relatively inconvenient, as they can use it only <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>way of <span class="gemarra-regular">hoisting </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and lowering. </span>The residents of the lower balcony must hoist the bucket from the lower balcony to the upper one before lowering it from there to draw water; <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas for </span>the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the other one, </span>i.e., the upper balcony, use of the water is convenient, as they can utilize it <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>way of <span class="gemarra-regular">lowering alone. </span>Consequently, this case <span class="gemarra-regular">is similar to </span>that of an area that can be used by the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>courtyard only <span class="gemarra-regular">by throwing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>by the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">as an entrance. </span>Since it is easier for the upper balcony to draw water, the lower balcony does not render it prohibited for the upper balcony in this particular case.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>we can learn that this is the opinion of Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">from that </span>teaching, <span class="gemarra-regular">which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>If there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two houses with three ruin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">between them, </span>the resident of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>house <span class="gemarra-regular">may use </span>the ruin <span class="gemarra-regular">adjacent to him by means of throwing </span>into the ruin through his windows that open out to that ruin, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the resident of <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>house <span class="gemarra-regular">may use </span>the ruin <span class="gemarra-regular">adjacent to him by means of throwing </span>through his windows, 

Daf 85b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and the middle</span> ruin <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>to both of them. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beruna sat and stated this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> in the name of Rav. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, a student of the Torah academy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, said to him: Did Rav </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? </span>Rav Beruna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Yes, </span>he did. He said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Show me his </span>place of <span class="gemarra-regular">lodging, </span>and I will go and ask him myself. <span class="gemarra-regular">He showed him </span>where Rav lived. Rabbi Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: </span>Did <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? He said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: Yes, </span>I did. 
Rabbi Elazar then <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Rav: Since you prohibit using the middle ruin, you evidently maintain that one person renders it prohibited for another by way of the air. That being the case, it must be that you permit the resident of each house to use the adjacent ruin because one’s use of the ruin, while not convenient for him, is more convenient than the other person’s usage. <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Master </span>himself who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>With regard to a place that can be used by the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one </span>courtyard only <span class="gemarra-regular">by lowering </span>an object down to it <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>by the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>courtyard only <span class="gemarra-regular">by throwing </span>an object on top of it, so that neither courtyard has convenient access to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>sets of residents <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited </span>from using it, although lowering an object is more convenient than throwing it? 
Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Do you think that </span>we are dealing with a case of three ruins <span class="gemarra-regular">positioned </span>alongside each other <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a straight <span class="gemarra-regular">line? No. They are </span>arranged in the form <span class="gemarra-regular">of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tripod</span>, i.e. in a triangular form. In other words, two of the ruins, each adjacent to one of the houses, are located next to each other; the third is positioned adjacent to one side of the other two, near both houses. The middle ruin is prohibited to the residents of both houses because both houses have equally inconvenient but direct access to it. However, each of the other ruins is permitted to the resident of the adjacent house, as he has direct access to it, while the resident of the other house can reach it only through the air of the ruin nearest to him, and Rav maintains that one person does not render it prohibited for use by another by way of the air. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to Rava: Let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, </span>who maintains that one renders it prohibited for another by way of the air, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not agree with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Dimi. When Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">less than four by four </span>handbreadths in size is an exempt domain with respect to carrying on Shabbat. Consequently, if this place is located between a public domain and a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted for </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">the people in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the public domain and the people in the private domain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to adjust </span>the burden <span class="gemarra-regular">on their shoulders in it, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">long as they do not exchange </span>objects with each other by way of the exempt domain. According to Shmuel’s opinion this should be prohibited due to the air of a different domain.
Rava replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>an exempt domain situated between a public domain and a private domain, the two existing <span class="gemarra-regular">domains by Torah law. </span>In that case, the Sages did not prohibit the use of the place due to the air. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to the air between private domains, we are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with domains </span>between which carrying is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages reinforced their statements </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">more than those of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> they added preventive measures in order to safeguard their decrees. Consequently, according to Shmuel, the Sages indeed decreed that one renders it prohibited for another by way of the air.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rava: But did Rav </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this, </span>that one person does not render it prohibited for use by another by way of the air? <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it stated </span>that <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two houses </span>belonging to one person that stood <span class="gemarra-regular">on two </span>opposite <span class="gemarra-regular">sides of a public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Rav Huna </span>said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to throw </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">from one </span>house <span class="gemarra-regular">to the other; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Shmuel said </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to throw from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one to the other. </span>Rav apparently forbade the act of throwing due to the prohibited air of the public domain that lies between the two houses.
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: Wasn’t it established that one </span>house was relatively <span class="gemarra-regular">higher and the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">lower </span>than the first? Rav prohibited throwing from one domain to the other, not due to the air of the public domain, but rather due to the difficulty of throwing from a low place to a higher one, as the thrown object <span class="gemarra-regular">might sometimes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">roll and fall </span>back into the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>people might <span class="gemarra-regular">come to pick it u</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> and carry it from the public domain to the private domain. It was for this reason that Rav prohibited throwing an object from one house to another.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who placed his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> of courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gatehous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> or in <span class="gemarra-regular">a portico, </span>a roofed structure without walls or with incomplete walls, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>one who deposited it in <span class="gemarra-regular">a balcony, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And one who resides </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in any of these structures, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not render it prohibited </span>for the homeowner and the other residents of the courtyard to carry, even if he did not contribute to the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Any place </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who resides there does not render it prohibited </span>for the other residents of the courtyard to carry, <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who places his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> there, his <span class="gemarra-regular">is not a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, except for a gatehouse </span>that belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">individual</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If a structure is used as a passageway by only one person, he does not render it prohibited for the other residents of the courtyard, and an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> placed there is a valid <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And any place </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">which the Sages said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a joining </span>of courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">may not be placed there, a merging </span>of alleyways <span class="gemarra-regular">may be placed there, except for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">airspace </span>of an <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway, </span>which is not inside one of the courtyards.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is he teaching us </span>by this? <span class="gemarra-regular">We have </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>this in the mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> placed his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a gatehouse </span>or in <span class="gemarra-regular">an portico</span> or in <span class="gemarra-regular">a balcony, it is not a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>It can be inferred from the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is not, a merging </span>of the alleyway, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>What, then, is novel in this statement? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary for him </span>to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gatehouse </span>that belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to an individual and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">the airspace </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway, which we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not learn </span>in the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">This was also </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who placed his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a gatehouse, </span>or in <span class="gemarra-regular">a portico, or </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a balcony, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or in a courtyard, or in an alleyway, this is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna that this <span class="gemarra-regular">is not an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Rather, you must <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should read: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">merging </span>of the alleyway.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: But if one places the food of the <span class="gemarra-regular">merging </span>of the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">in the alleyway</span> itself, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>properly <span class="gemarra-regular">guarded, </span>which means that it is as though he has not placed the merging of the alleyway there at all. Rather, you must <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should read: If he placed his merging of the alleyway <span class="gemarra-regular">in a courtyard in the alleyway, </span>it is valid. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>If there were <span class="gemarra-regular">a group </span>of people <span class="gemarra-regular">who were dining </span>together on Shabbat eve, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the day became sanctified for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them, </span>i.e., Shabbat began while they were eating, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may rely upon the bread on the table for an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> of courtyards, so that they are all permitted to carry in the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>they may rely on the bread <span class="gemarra-regular">for a merging </span>of the alleyway.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>The two versions <span class="gemarra-regular">do not disagree </span>with regard to whether the bread counts as an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> or a merging of the alleyway. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>the teaching that states it can be used as an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">dining in the house, </span>as food deposited in a house can be used as an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for the courtyard. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>it is referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">dining in the courtyard, </span>and they may therefore rely on the bread only as a merging of the alleyway but not as an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rabba: </span>A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught that supports</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you. Joinings of courtyards </span>are deposited <span class="gemarra-regular">in a courtyard, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and mergings of alleyways </span>are placed <span class="gemarra-regular">in an alleyway. And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we discussed </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and raised a difficulty: How can it be that <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of courtyards </span>are deposited <span class="gemarra-regular">in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard? But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one deposited his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a gatehouse, </span>or in <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">portico, or </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a balcony it is not a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The mishna clearly indicates that the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may not be deposited in the airspace of a courtyard. Rather, you must <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should read as follows: <span class="gemarra-italic">Eiruvin</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of a courtyard </span>are placed <span class="gemarra-regular">in a house in </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard; </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">mergings of alleyways </span>are placed <span class="gemarra-regular">in a courtyard </span>that opens <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway.</span>
We learned in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda says: If </span>the homeowner <span class="gemarra-regular">has there, </span>in the hay shed or one of the other places listed, <span class="gemarra-regular">a right</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of usage, </span>the person living there does not render the courtyard prohibited. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a right of usage? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">For example, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the courtyard of </span>a man named <span class="gemarra-regular">Bonyas, </span>an extremely wealthy individual who allowed various people to take up residence on his property, and he kept some of his many possessions in the living quarters assigned to those people. As he retained the right to remove his articles from their apartments, those areas continued to be regarded as quarters belonging to Bonyas and the people living there were deemed members of his household. 
The Gemara relates another incident involving Bonyas and his wealth: The <span class="gemarra-regular">son of Bonyas </span><span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. Realizing from his visitor’s clothing that he was dealing with a wealthy individual, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>his attendants: <span class="gemarra-regular">Make way for one</span> who possesses <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred </span><span class="gemarra-italic">maneh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., one hundred times one hundred <span class="it-text">zuz</span>, as one of this status deserves to be honored in accordance with his riches. Later, <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="gemarra-regular">person came </span>before him, and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi once again turned to his attendants and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>

Daf 86a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Make way </span>even more <span class="gemarra-regular">for one </span>who possesses <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundred </span><span class="gemarra-italic">maneh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, said before him: My teacher, </span>Bonyas, <span class="gemarra-regular">father of this </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">has a thousand ships out at sea and, corresponding </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to them, a thousand towns on land. </span>He should be granted pride of place due to his exorbitant wealth. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: When you reach </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">father, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tell him: Do not send him to me in these </span><span class="gemarra-regular">garments. </span>Dress him in accordance with his wealth and status, so that he will be honored accordingly.
In explanation of this story, the Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi would <span class="gemarra-regular">honor the wealthy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">honor the wealthy, in accordance with Rava bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Mari’s interpretation </span>of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“May he be enthroned</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before God forever; appoint mercy and truth, that they may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> preserve him” </span>(Psalms 61:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">When may he be enthroned </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before God forever? When he appoints </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">man</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">mercy and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">truth that they may preserve him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rava bar Mari explains the word <span class="it-text">man</span> as referring to portions of food and interprets the verse as follows: If one provides food to others, he deserves to be enthroned before God, to be shown honor and respect. Consequently, it is proper to honor the wealthy who bestow such kindnesses. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: </span>What is considered a right of usage? <span class="gemarra-regular">For example, </span>if the homeowner stores <span class="gemarra-regular">the pin of a plough </span>in his tenant’s quarters. The tenant is prohibited to remove this pin from his residence on Shabbat due to its being set aside from use [<span class="it-text">muktze</span>], and the homeowner therefore enjoys a fixed right of usage there. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">of the school </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel taught </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If the homeowner stores <span class="gemarra-regular">an object that can be moved on Shabbat </span>with his tenant, the tenant’s residence <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>the other residence <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> if he neglected to join the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. This is not considered a right of usage. If the <span class="gemarra-regular">object </span>being stored is one <span class="gemarra-regular">that cannot be moved on Shabbat, </span>the tenant’s residence <span class="gemarra-regular">does not render it prohibited for </span>them to use the courtyard.
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that if the tenant <span class="gemarra-regular">has untithed produce </span>that may not be moved on Shabbat; or if <span class="gemarra-regular">he has lumps </span>of glass or iron; <span class="gemarra-regular">or anything </span>else <span class="gemarra-regular">that may not be moved</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat </span>that the homeowner deposited with him, the tenant <span class="gemarra-regular">does not render it prohibited for </span>the other residents to use the courtyard.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who leaves his</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is located in a shared courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> goes to spend Shabbat in a different town, whether </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile or a Jew, he renders it prohibited</span> for the other residents to use the courtyard as though he were still at home; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: He does not render</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it prohibited for </span>them, as he left behind him an empty residence.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">A gentile renders it prohibited </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">render it prohibited, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not the manner of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew to come </span>home <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat. </span>A Jew will not return home, therefore his empty residence does not render it prohibited. By contrast, a gentile might return over the course of Shabbat. Therefore, he is not considered to have fully uprooted himself from his house, and he renders it prohibited.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: Even </span>if the Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">left his house and went </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to spend Shabbat with his daughter </span>who lived <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">same town, he does not render it prohibited. </span>Although he can return home at any time, it is assumed <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he has already removed from his mind </span>any thought of going back there and has established his Shabbat residence away from his home.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if one went to <span class="gemarra-regular">his daughter’s</span> house; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if he went to <span class="gemarra-regular">his son’s </span>house, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>this is not the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. One cannot be sure that he will be able to stay at his son’s house, for his daughter-in-law might object to his presence and force him to return home. <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> people say: If a dog barks at you, enter; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if a female dog barks at you, leave. </span>In other words, the objections of a female, such as one’s daughter-in-law, who will certainly not be opposed by her husband, are more powerful than those of a male, such as one’s son-in-law.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern that is </span>located <span class="gemarra-regular">between two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyards, </span>situated partly in each courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">draw </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">from it on Shabbat, </span>lest the residents of one courtyard draw water from the domain of the other courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless a partition ten handbreadths high was erected for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>as a separation between the domains. This partition is effective <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">below, </span>in the water, <span class="gemarra-regular">or whether </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is within the </span>airspace of the cistern below the <span class="gemarra-regular">rim, </span>above the surface of the water.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon ben Gamliel said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> This is the subject of an early dispute of <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span>, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai said </span>that the partition, which permits drawing water, must be placed <span class="gemarra-regular">below; and Beit Hillel said </span>it should be positioned <span class="gemarra-regular">above</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rabbi Yehuda said: A partition is no better than the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wall between them. </span>A wall dividing the two courtyards passes over the cistern, therefore it is not necessary to erect an additional partition in the cistern’s airspace. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: </span>When Beit Shammai said <span class="gemarra-regular">below</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>they meant <span class="gemarra-regular">actually below, </span>near the water; the partition need not touch the water itself. When Beit Hillel said <span class="gemarra-regular">above</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>they meant <span class="gemarra-regular">actually above, </span>higher than the water and near the rim of the cistern. <span class="gemarra-regular">And both of these </span>are within the airspace of the <span class="gemarra-regular">cistern. And Rav Yehuda said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Below </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">below the water, </span>so that part of the partition is inside the water; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">above the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> water, </span>in such a manner that the partition does not come into contact with the water.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ḥanan said to Abaye: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: Below </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">below the water, what is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> different </span>about a case where the partition is <span class="gemarra-regular">actually below</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in the airspace cistern near the water, that led Rav Yehuda to say that one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>draw water in that case? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>he was concerned lest <span class="gemarra-regular">the water </span>of the two courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">become intermingled </span>beneath the partition. In a case where the partition is located <span class="gemarra-regular">below the water, </span>near the bottom of the cistern, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">well, won’t the water </span>of the two courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">become </span><span class="gemarra-regular">intermingled </span>above it?
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t you hear that which Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said, and some arrived at </span>this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">name of Rabbi Ḥiyya: The tops of the reeds </span>of the partition <span class="gemarra-regular">must be visible a handbreadth above </span>the surface of <span class="gemarra-regular">the water? </span>This will ensure that there is a full partition between the two sides of the cistern. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">further </span>asked: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Above </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">above the water, </span>we can inquire: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> different </span>about a case where the partition is <span class="gemarra-regular">actually above</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., near the rim of the cistern that led Rav Yehuda to say that one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>draw water in that case? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>he was concerned lest <span class="gemarra-regular">the water </span>of the two courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">become intermingled </span>beneath the partition. However, even if the partition is <span class="gemarra-regular">above the water</span> below the rim of the cistern, <span class="gemarra-regular">the water </span>of the two courtyards will <span class="gemarra-regular">also become intermingled </span>beneath it. Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Haven’t you heard that which Ya’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">akov from Karḥina taught: The ends of the reeds </span>of a partition <span class="gemarra-regular">must be immersed </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">a handbreadth </span>into the <span class="gemarra-regular">water, </span>so that they divide the water in the cistern?
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the Gemara raises a further question. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda said: </span>If there is a cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam of four</span> handbreadths, it <span class="gemarra-regular">permits </span>one to carry underneath it <span class="gemarra-regular">in a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ruin. </span>If a crossbeam four handbreadths wide is laid across the walls of a ruin, its edges are viewed as though they descended to the ground on each side, thereby forming partitions that permit one to carry under the cross beam. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>

Daf 86b

A cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam of four</span> handbreadths laid across a cistern located between two courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">permits</span> one to draw <span class="gemarra-regular">wate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> from that cistern.
With this in mind, the following difficulty arises: The <span class="gemarra-regular">bucket </span>he uses to draw the water <span class="gemarra-regular">might drift </span>under the cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the other side </span>of the cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">and bring </span>water from the other courtyard. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">established that a bucket does not drift more than four </span><span class="gemarra-regular">handbreadths </span>from the point where it was lowered, and it will therefore stay on its original side of the partition.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Nonetheless, the water becomes intermingled under the </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam, </span>and consequently the bucket will bring up water from the other courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that the reason for the leniency is not that the cross beam actually prevents the flow of the water, but <span class="gemarra-regular">because the Sages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were lenient with regard to water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> They allowed a partition suspended above the water to be considered as though it blocked the flow of the water. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Tavla </span><span class="gemarra-regular">asked of Rav: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a suspended partition, does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it permit </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">in a ruin? </span>Do we say that the remnants of the walls suspended in the air are considered as though they descended to the ground and closed off the area, thereby rendering it a private domain? Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: A suspended partition </span>of this kind <span class="gemarra-regular">permits </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of water, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were lenient with regard to water.</span>
The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>There is no need for a partition in the cistern, as <span class="gemarra-regular">a partition </span>inside a cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">is no </span>better than the wall above it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Rabbi Yehuda stated this in accordance with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, who said: A suspended partition</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permits </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">even on land, </span>as it is considered as though it descended to the ground and sealed off the area. Accordingly, there is no need to erect a partition inside the airspace of a cistern.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who lowers </span><span class="it-text">sukka</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">walls from above </span>going <span class="gemarra-regular">downward, when</span> the walls <span class="gemarra-regular">are three handbreadths higher than the ground, </span>the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is invalid, </span>as they are not considered partitions; but if he constructed walls <span class="gemarra-regular">from below </span>going <span class="gemarra-regular">upward, if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they are ten handbreadths high </span>the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is valid, </span>even if they do not reach the roofing.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Just as </span>with regard to walls constructed <span class="gemarra-regular">from below </span>going <span class="gemarra-regular">upward, ten </span>handbreadths suffice, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>too, in the case of walls built <span class="gemarra-regular">from above </span>going <span class="gemarra-regular">downward, ten </span>handbreadths are enough for it to be considered a whole wall, even if it more than three handbreadths above the ground. Similarly, Rabbi Yehuda maintains that a partition suspended above a cistern is considered as though it descended and sealed off the area. 
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">But this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> for we can distinguish between the two opinions and claim that <span class="gemarra-regular">neither Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>in accordance <span class="gemarra-regular">with Rabbi Yosei, nor does Rabbi Yosei hold </span>in accordance <span class="gemarra-regular">with Rabbi Yehuda. </span>
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda does not</span> necessarily <span class="gemarra-regular">hold </span>in accordance <span class="gemarra-regular">with Rabbi Yosei, </span>as a distinction can be made between the two cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda stated</span> his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to the joining of courtyards</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which are required <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law, but </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, which </span>is required <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah law, no, </span>he did not say that we can rely on suspended partitions.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei does not </span>necessarily <span class="gemarra-regular">hold </span>in accordance <span class="gemarra-regular">with Rabbi Yehuda, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei stated </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">is a prohibition</span> stated in the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">from a positive commandment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The prohibition is not written as a negative commandment, but it can be inferred from a positive commandment. Neglect of the positive commandment of <span class="it-text">sukka</span> is not punishable by the court, therefore we are not stringent in this regard. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span>which is <span class="gemarra-regular">a prohibition </span>punishable <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stoning, </span>Rabbi Yosei <span class="gemarra-regular">did not state </span>his opinion. Consequently, Rabbi Yosei might agree that we must be very stringent with regard to all <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of Shabbat, even those that are rabbinic in origin. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you ask: That incident, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which occurred in Tzippori</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> when they relied on suspended partitions on land for Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">on whose authority was it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">performed? </span>It was done <span class="gemarra-regular">not on the authority of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosei, but </span>rather <span class="gemarra-regular">it was performed on the authority of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, </span>who maintains that a suspended partition renders it permitted to carry even if it is over land and even on Shabbat. 
The incident transpired in the following manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">As when Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">once </span>happened that the people <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and did not bring a Torah scroll </span>to the synagogue on Friday <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day, </span>which meant they were left without a scroll from which to read on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">On the following day, </span>Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">they spread a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sheet over the pillar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> positioned between the house where the scroll was kept and the synagogue, thereby forming a corridor with partitions suspended on each side. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in this manner <span class="gemarra-regular">they brought the Torah scroll </span>to the synagogue <span class="gemarra-regular">and read</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara expresses surprise at the wording of this account: Did they actually <span class="gemarra-regular">spread </span>sheets on Shabbat? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it permitted </span>to do so <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? But doesn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t everyone agree that one may not erect a temporary </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tent on Shabbat </span><span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>? Spreading sheets over pillars is considered constructing a temporary tent.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>what happened was that <span class="gemarra-regular">they found sheets spread over the pillars, </span>which they used as partitions, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in this manner <span class="gemarra-regular">they brought the Torah </span><span class="gemarra-regular">scroll </span>to the synagogue <span class="gemarra-regular">and read from it. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: Rabbi Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya said the same thing. </span>Both were very lenient with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a partition over water. The ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda is that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which we </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">said, </span>that the wall of the courtyard permits a cistern. The ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is as we learned: Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a balcony that contains four cubits </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by four cubits, </span>which is suspended over water, 

Daf 87a

<span class="gemarra-regular">one may carve in it </span>a hole of <span class="gemarra-regular">four by four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">and draw </span>water through it. Even if there are no actual partitions around the hole, the section surrounding the hole is considered as though it were bent downward and formed partitions ten handbreadths high on all sides. Consequently, it is permitted to draw water through the hole.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: But perhaps that is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so, </span>as we can distinguish between the opinions. It is possible that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda stated </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only there, </span>with regard to the wall of the courtyard and the cistern, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he said </span>that we rely on the halakhic principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">extend and lower the partition. </span>The partition above the cistern is considered as though it descended to the bottom. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">bend </span>the partition <span class="gemarra-regular">and extend </span>it downward, as suggested by Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>he does not accept this principle.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>we can likewise say that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">only there, </span>in the case of the balcony, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the Sea of Tiberias, </span>i.e., the Sea of Galilee, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it has </span>clearly defined <span class="gemarra-regular">banks</span> around it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and towns and enclosures surround it </span>on all sides. The Sea of Galilee is surrounded by clear boundaries on all sides and is therefore somewhat similar to a private domain in appearance. Consequently, even a minor adjustment is sufficient. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, with regard to other waters, no, </span>Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya did not permit this practice.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: And according to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the statement of Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya, </span>if the balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">was less than three handbreadths </span>away <span class="gemarra-regular">from the wall, </span>it is permitted to draw water from it in the following circumstances: <span class="gemarra-regular">Its length must be four cubits, and its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">width </span>must be <span class="gemarra-regular">eleven </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">amount. </span>By carving out a hole of slightly more than one handbreadth by four handbreadths on the side near the wall, alongside the other three handbreadths, one creates a hole of four handbreadths by four handbreadths. This hole is surrounded by partitions ten handbreadths high on each side. How so? The wall itself is one partition. The four-cubit length is viewed as bent down on both sides of the hole, forming two partitions of ten handbreadths; the remaining ten handbreadths of the width is seen as though it were bent down, which creates a partition on the fourth side of the balcony. 
If the balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">was upright</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., it had upright partitions on all sides (Rabbeinu Ḥananel), <span class="gemarra-regular">the height </span>of these partitions <span class="gemarra-regular">must be ten handbreadths, and the width </span>of the balcony must be <span class="gemarra-regular">six handbreadths and two </span>minimal <span class="gemarra-regular">amounts. </span>This leaves slightly more than a handbreadth on each side of the hole of four handbreadths, on which he can stand.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yehoshua, said: </span>If it <span class="gemarra-regular">was positioned in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">corne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> between two walls (Rabbeinu Ḥananel), <span class="gemarra-regular">the height </span>of the partition <span class="gemarra-regular">must be ten handbreadths, and the </span>requisite <span class="gemarra-regular">width</span> of the balcony must be <span class="gemarra-regular">two handbreadths and two </span>minimal <span class="gemarra-regular">amounts. </span>As he is able to stand, he is provided with actual partitions. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥananya ben Akavya said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a balcony </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits by four cubits </span>is suspended above water, <span class="gemarra-regular">one carves in it </span>a hole of <span class="gemarra-regular">four by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">draws </span>water through it, under <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> circumstances </span>can a balcony with these dimensions <span class="gemarra-regular">be found?</span>
The Gemara answers: It is necessary in the case of a balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">that is built in the shape of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mortar, </span>where the balcony is positioned over the water on its own pillars and far removed from any wall. In that case, all of the partitions must be constructed from its floor space. And the balcony must be four cubits by four cubits in size.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a water channel that passes through </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard, </span>the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">may not draw </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it on Shabbat, unless they erected for it a partition </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths high at the entrance and at the exit </span>of the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>There is no need for a special partition, as the <span class="gemarra-regular">wall that </span>runs <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">top of it, </span>i.e., the courtyard wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as a partition.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving a </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">channel </span>that passed through the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the town of <span class="gemarra-regular">Avel, </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">would draw </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">from it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat by the authority of the Elders, </span>relying on the courtyard wall suspended above it. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that channel <span class="gemarra-regular">was not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the size </span>that requires a partition, i.e., it was less than ten handbreadths deep or less than ten handbreadths wide, it was permitted to draw water from it even without a partition.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">they erected </span>a partition <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the water channel <span class="gemarra-regular">at the entrance but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they did not erect </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">for it at the exit, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">they erected </span>a partition <span class="gemarra-regular">for it at the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exit but they did not erect </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">for it at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the entrance, one may not draw </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">from it on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, unless they erected for it a partition ten handbreadths </span>high both <span class="gemarra-regular">at the exit and at the entrance. Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda says: The wall </span>that runs <span class="gemarra-regular">on top of it, </span>i.e., the courtyard wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered as a partition. </span>Therefore, there is no need for a special partition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> incident involving the water channel that went from Avel to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Tzippori</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">would draw </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">from it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat by the authority of the Elders, </span>without any additional partition. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Are you trying to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a proof from there? </span>That was either <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that the channel <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not ten handbreadths deep or </span>because it was not <span class="gemarra-regular">four</span> handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide. </span>It lacked the requisite measure to be considered a domain in its own right. Everyone agrees that it is permitted to draw water from it even without an additional partition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught in another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a water </span><span class="gemarra-regular">channel that passes between the window</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of two houses, if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may lower a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bucket </span>from the window <span class="gemarra-regular">and draw </span>water from it; however, if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not lower a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bucket and draw </span>water from it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gamliel says: </span>If it is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than four </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may lower a bucket and draw </span>water from it; but if it is at least <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lower a bucket and draw </span>water. 
With regard to these measures of three and four handbreadths, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing</span> here? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the water channel itself, </span>that it was three or four handbreadths wide, this presents a difficulty, <span class="gemarra-regular">for when Rav Dimi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan said: A </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cannot be less than four </span>handbreadths wide. The <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> is an intermediate domain established by the Sages, whose status is between a public and a private domain. Any open area that is not a public thoroughfare, e.g., a field, sea, river, alleyway, or a lane, is classified as a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>. It is prohibited to carry an article four cubits within a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, or to transfer an object from a private domain or a public domain to a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, or vice versa. One who draws water through a window from a water channel into a house has carried from a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> to a private domain. Consequently, if the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> dispute the width of the channel, they are in effect disagreeing about the minimal size of a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>. 
The Gemara resumes its question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say, </span>then, that <span class="gemarra-regular">the teaching that </span>Rav Dimi <span class="gemarra-regular">cited, </span>that a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> cannot be less than four handbreadths wide, was actually the subject of a dispute of <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span> and not a unanimous <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
The Gemara rejects the previous explanation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the measure of three or four handbreadths is referring not to the channel itself but <span class="gemarra-regular">to the banks </span>of the channel, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> it is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">exchange</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The dispute here does not concern the measure of a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, but the measure of an exempt domain. It is permitted to transfer the empty bucket from the window, which is a private domain, by way of the channel’s banks, which are exempt domains, to the water channel, which is a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, and back again with the full bucket.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But when Rav Dimi came</span> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: A place that does not have </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">four by four </span>handbreadths is an <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt domain. </span>Consequently, if this place is situated between a public domain and a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted for </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">the people </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the private domain and for the people of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">public domain to </span>adjust the burdens on their <span class="gemarra-regular">shoulders on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it, provided </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not exchange </span>objects between them via the exempt domain. How, then, can the bucket be transferred from the window to the channel, and vice versa, by means of the banks? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>Rav Dimi is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">domains </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law, </span>i.e., this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> involves the transfer of objects from a private domain to a public domain via an exempt domain. The Sages forbade this activity, so that people would not transfer objects directly from the private domain to the public domain. 

Daf 87b

However, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>Rav Dimi is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">domains by rabbinic law. </span>As the transfer of objects from a private domain to a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> is prohibited only by rabbinic decree, the Sages did not prohibit this transfer when it is accomplished by way of an exempt domain. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabbi Yoḥanan said </span>that transferring objects from one domain to another by way of an exempt domain is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">even in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">domains </span>that apply <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rabbinic law. As we learned </span>in a mishna: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a wall that is between two courtyards, </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths high and four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide, </span>the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a separate one for each courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they do not establish one </span>joint <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">If there was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">produce on top </span>of the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">these, </span>the residents of one courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">may ascend from this </span>side <span class="gemarra-regular">and eat </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and those, </span>the residents of the other courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">may ascend </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from the other </span>side <span class="gemarra-regular">and eat </span>them, provided that they do not bring the produce down from the top of the wall to the courtyards.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">the wall is breached, </span>a distinction applies: If the breach is <span class="gemarra-regular">up to ten cubits </span>wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and if they wish, they may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, for it is like an entrance. </span>This breach is similar to any opening of less than ten cubits. If the breach is <span class="gemarra-regular">more than this, they may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but they may not establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>A breach of this size nullifies the partition, as the two courtyards merge into a single domain. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we discussed this </span>mishna and raised a question: If this wall <span class="gemarra-regular">is not four </span>handbreadths thick, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>In that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> air of two domains controls it. </span>As the wall is not broad enough to be considered a domain of its own, its top belongs to both courtyards, and it is therefore prohibited to both of them. Accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> move </span>anything <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>top of the wall even as much as <span class="gemarra-regular">a hairsbreadth.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>disagreed and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: These, </span>the residents of one courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">may carry up</span> their food <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>their courtyard to the top of the wall <span class="gemarra-regular">and eat </span>it there, <span class="gemarra-regular">and those, </span>the residents of the other courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">carry up </span>their food <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> their courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and eat </span>it there. The entire top of the wall has the status of an exempt domain that can be combined with either courtyard, provided that the residents of the different courtyards do not exchange food between them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan follows his</span> regular line of <span class="gemarra-regular">argument </span>here, <span class="gemarra-regular">for when Rav Dimi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan said: A place that contains less than four by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four </span>handbreadths is an exempt domain. Consequently, if this place is located between a public domain and a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted for the people of the private domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and for the people of the public domain to load</span> their burdens <span class="gemarra-regular">onto their shoulders in it, as long as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they do not exchange </span>objects with each other by way of the exempt domain. Apparently, Rabbi Yoḥanan prohibited exchanging articles between two domains, even if they are rabbinic domains.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>ruling concerning a wall between two courtyards, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ze’eiri stated it </span>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan. Rav Dimi transmitted a different tradition of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion. The Gemara raises a difficulty: Nonetheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> concerning a water channel between two windows <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult according to Ze’eiri. </span>
The Gemara answers: Ze’eiri <span class="gemarra-regular">explains </span>that the measures mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> are referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the water channel itself. </span>That is to say, the dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Sages does not concern the width of the banks of the channel but the width of the channel itself, as they dispute the basic parameters of a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Ze’eiri maintains that the teaching of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Dimi, </span>that a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> can be no less than four handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in fact the subject of a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let</span> the water channel that passes through the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span>treated at least <span class="gemarra-regular">like the cavities of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> even if it is not wide enough to be considered a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> on its own. Just as the cavities in the wall of a private domain are considered a private domain even if they do not include the prescribed measure of a private domain, the water channel passing through the courtyard should likewise be considered as a cavity of the larger water channel in the street. It should therefore have the status of a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Avin and Rav Ḥanina bar Avin both said: There</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is no </span>category of <span class="gemarra-regular">cavities for a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>As a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> is only a rabbinic in origin, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is not so stringent with regard to this domain. Consequently, a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> does not annex nearby cavities.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: You </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">even say </span>that in general <span class="gemarra-regular">there are holes for a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">this applies only to </span>holes that are <span class="gemarra-regular">adjacent </span>to the <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, and are therefore nullified by it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, however,</span> we are dealing with a water channel <span class="gemarra-regular">that is </span>far <span class="gemarra-regular">removed </span>from the <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>. Therefore, it does not assume the status of the <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said </span>a different explanation of the dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis: The measures of three and four handbreadths refer neither to the width of the water trench nor to the width of its banks. Rather, we are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one fashioned outlet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>the water channel <span class="gemarra-regular">at its ends, </span>i.e., one formed gaps in the partitions to allow the water to flow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis follow their</span> regular line of <span class="gemarra-regular">argument, </span>that the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span> applies only to a gap less than three handbreadths wide. An opening less than three handbreadths is therefore considered completely closed, while one of four is not viewed as closed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel follows his </span>regular line of <span class="gemarra-regular">argument</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>that the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span> applies even to a gap of four handbreadths.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a balcony that </span>extends <span class="gemarra-regular">over </span>a body of <span class="gemarra-regular">water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if a hole was opened in the floor, its residents <span class="gemarra-regular">may not draw </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">from it </span>through the hole <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat, unless they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">erected for it a partition ten handbreadths high </span>around the hole. It is permitted to draw water by means of that partition, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it is positioned <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>the balcony, in which case the partition is seen as descending downward, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>whether it is placed <span class="gemarra-regular">below </span>the balcony.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>such <span class="gemarra-regular">balconies, one above the other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">they erected </span>a partition <span class="gemarra-regular">for the upper balcony but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they did not erect </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">for the lower one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">are both prohibited </span>from drawing water through the upper one, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless they establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> between them.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya ben Akavya, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya ben Akavya says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a balcony </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that contains four </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">by four cubits </span>is suspended above water, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may carve out </span>a hole of <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">by four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">in it and draw </span>water through it. The section of the floor surrounding the hole is considered as though it bent downward and formed a partition ten handbreadths high on all sides. Consequently, no other partition is necessary. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra: Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya permitted </span>a balcony that is not surrounded by partitions <span class="gemarra-regular">only in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sea of Tiberias, </span>the Sea of Galilee, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it has </span>clearly defined <span class="gemarra-regular">banks </span>that are visible on all sides, <span class="gemarra-regular">and towns and enclosures surround it. </span>It is therefore considered part of an inhabited area. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to other waters, </span>such as larger seas, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>he did not permit them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Our Sages taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya permitted three activities to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inhabitants of Tiberias: They may draw water </span>from the sea <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>a hole cut out of <span class="gemarra-regular">a balcony on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and they may insulate </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">in the pods </span>of legumes, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they may dry themselves </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">with a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> towel [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aluntit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara clarifies this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">They</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may draw water through </span>a hole cut out of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> balcony on Shabbat </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that we stated </span>above. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they may insulate </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">in the pods </span>of legumes; <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">rose early </span>in the morning <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bring residue </span>from the field, e.g., the straw of wheat or the stalks or pods of legumes, in order to store his produce in them, the following distinction applies: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he rose early <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the residue still <span class="gemarra-regular">has dew</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on it, </span>and he wants to use this moisture for his produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>instance <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered </span>to be in the following category: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>any water <span class="gemarra-regular">be put. </span>Food or produce can contract ritual impurity only if it has come into contact with a liquid, either directly through the action of its owner, or without his direct intervention but with his approval. This is derived from the verse: “But if any water be put on the seed, and any part of their carcass falls on it, it shall be unclean to you” (Leviticus 11:38). Returning to our issue, if this person rose early because the residue still has dew on it, the produce he stores in it is rendered susceptible to ritual impurity, as it has come into contact with the dew with its owner’s approval.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if</span> one rose early only <span class="gemarra-regular">in order not to neglect his</span> usual <span class="gemarra-regular">work, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">is not considered </span>an instance of <span class="gemarra-regular">if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it be put, </span>as it was not his intention to place the dew on the produce. Unintended contact with a liquid does not render food susceptible to ritual impurity. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> normally, </span>unless they specify otherwise, 

Daf 88a

<span class="gemarra-regular">the inhabitants of Tiberias </span>are considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like one </span>who does so in order <span class="gemarra-regular">not to neglect </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">work. </span>Most of them are ordinary laborers. It can be assumed that if they rose early to bring home straw or stalks in which to store their produce, they did so only to save work time.
The Gemara turns to the third activity that Rabbi Ḥananya ben Akavya permitted for the inhabitants of Tiberias: <span class="gemarra-regular">And they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may dry themselves with a towel. What is </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>who washed himself in cold water on Shabbat or a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">may dry himself with a towe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and place it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on a window, </span>as there is no concern that he perform the prohibited labor of wringing out the towel. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he may not give </span>the towel <span class="gemarra-regular">to the bathhouse attendants [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">olayerin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because they are suspected with regard to that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matter, </span>as they might wring out the towel before giving it to other bathers. Furthermore, one may not bring the towel home because if he does so, he might forget and wring it out. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon said: He may even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bring </span>the towel <span class="gemarra-regular">in his hand to his house, </span>as there is no concern lest he wring it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna: They taught </span>the leniency of partitions surrounding a hole in a balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to drawing </span>water through the hole; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to pour </span>waste water down the hole, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheizvi raised an objection </span><span class="gemarra-regular">against this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is </span>the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between this</span> case of a hole in the balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">uka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> used in a courtyard for waste water? The Sages rule in the next mishna below that one who digs a pit with a capacity of two <span class="it-text">se’a</span> in a small courtyard that is less than four cubits may pour waste water into the courtyard on Shabbat, even if the pit was full before Shabbat. He need not be concerned that this will cause water to flow out of the courtyard into the public domain on Shabbat.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">These </span>waters, which are poured out into the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>likely to be <span class="gemarra-regular">absorbed </span>into the ground, and it is therefore uncertain that the water will indeed leave the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">But these, </span>the water poured through the hole into the body of water under the balcony, <span class="gemarra-regular">will not be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> absorbed. </span>Therefore, one knows with certainty that the water will flow out beyond the permitted boundary. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Huna </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">said: You should not say that it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">drawing </span>water through the hole in the balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">that is permitted, </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">pouring </span>waste water through it <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited; rather, pouring </span>waste water through the hole <span class="gemarra-regular">is also</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Sheizvi said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>exactly the same as the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the <span class="gemarra-regular">pit </span>discussed in the next mishna. The Gemara rejects this argument: It is necessary to specify both <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>there is a difference between the cases, as <span class="gemarra-regular">these</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the water poured in the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>likely to be <span class="gemarra-regular">absorbed </span>into the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas these, </span>the water poured through the hole in the balcony, <span class="gemarra-regular">will not be absorbed. </span>Rabba bar Rav Huna therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that we do not distinguish between the two cases. 
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">likewise, </span>if there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two balconies, one </span>above the other, and a partition is erected for the upper balcony but is not erected for the lower one, it is prohibited for residents of both balconies to draw water through the upper one, unless they establish a joint <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> between them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: They taught </span>that one balcony renders it prohibited for residents of the other <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the one balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">is near </span>the other, i.e., horizontally within four handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if each balcony is <span class="gemarra-regular">separated </span>by four handbreadths from the other, so that the residents of each balcony can use the other only by means of the air, the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the upper </span>balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted </span>to draw water, while the residents of the lower one are prohibited from doing so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav </span>follows <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>regular line of <span class="gemarra-regular">argument </span>here, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav said: One person does not impose restrictions upon another</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person by way of the air. </span>Since the lower balcony is far from the higher one, it does not prohibit it, although it can make use of it by means of the vacant airspace between them, albeit with difficulty.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and Rav Yosef said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Oshaya said: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">stealing applies to Shabbat </span>domains, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a ruin must</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be returned to its owner. </span>
The Gemara registers surprise: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">itself is difficult, </span>i.e., it is self-contradictory. <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">stealing applies to Shabbat </span>domains, which at this point is understood by the Gemara as referring to the following case: A person’s house adjoins the ruin of another, and he observes that the ruin has been left deserted by its owner. If this person uses the ruin during the week, on Shabbat he may treat it as though it were his own, by carrying objects from his own house into the ruin and vice versa. <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>we can infer that a stolen place <span class="gemarra-regular">is acquired </span>for the purpose of Shabbat domains, although it does not belong to the person for other purposes. However, you subsequently said that <span class="gemarra-regular">a ruin must be returned to its owner, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">from here </span>we can infer that a ruin <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not acquired </span>for the purpose of Shabbat domains by the person who used it during the week, and therefore he may not carry objects from his own house into the ruin.
The Gemara answers: We should not understand this statement as suggested above, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Oshaya <span class="gemarra-regular">are saying: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>returning <span class="gemarra-regular">stolen </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">applies to Shabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> domains. <span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>This means <span class="gemarra-regular">that a ruin must be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">returned to its owner. </span>In other words, one who uses a ruin during the week does not acquire it even for the purpose of Shabbat domains.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: And we </span>ourselves <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection </span>against <span class="gemarra-regular">our </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching, </span>as we learned in the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise, </span>if there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two balconies, one above the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> other, </span>they prohibit one another. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> against <span class="gemarra-regular">stealing applies on Shabbat, </span>which means one may not use the domain of another, and he acquires no rights to it if he does so, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>are the two balconies <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from using it. The lower one has no right to make use of the upper one.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">We are dealing here with </span>a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where, for example, </span>the residents of the upper balcony and the residents of the lower balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">jointly erected a partitio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> for the upper balcony. Consequently, the residents of the lower balcony share the right to use it with the residents of the upper one. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they erected </span>a separate partition <span class="gemarra-regular">for the lower</span> balcony, the residents of the upper balcony should <span class="gemarra-regular">likewise </span>be prohibited to use it. As the residents of the lower one are partners in the upper one, they should prohibit its residents from using it.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> erected </span>a separate partition <span class="gemarra-regular">for the lower </span>balcony, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>each thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">revealed their intention </span>to the residents of the upper balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">that: It is not my wish to be </span>partners <span class="gemarra-regular">with you. </span>Consequently, they no longer prohibit the residents of the upper balcony from using it. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard that is less than four</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits </span>by four cubits in area, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not pour</span> waste <span class="gemarra-regular">water into it on Shabbat, unless a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was fashioned </span>to receive the water, and the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span><span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> in volume <span class="gemarra-regular">from its edge below. </span>
This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the pit was fashioned <span class="gemarra-regular">outside</span> the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>whether it was dug <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the courtyard itself. The <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>difference is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the pit was dug <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>in the adjoining public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> necessary to arch over </span>it, so that the water will not flow into the public domain. If it was dug <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not necessary to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">arch over </span>it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: </span>In the case of a drainage <span class="gemarra-regular">ditch whose </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are arched ove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the public domain, one may pour</span> waste <span class="gemarra-regular">water into it on Shabbat. And the Rabbis say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">a roof or a courtyard </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a hundred</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits </span>in area, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not pour </span>water directly <span class="gemarra-regular">onto</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the mouth of the </span>drainage <span class="gemarra-regular">ditch. However, he may pour</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the roof, </span>from which <span class="gemarra-regular">the water spills into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the drain </span>of its own accord.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A courtyard and a portico, </span>a roofed but unwalled structure in front of a house, <span class="gemarra-regular">combine </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for the four cubits </span>by virtue of which it is permitted to pour water even into a courtyard that lacks a pit. <span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two upper stories [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">deyotaot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one opposite the other </span>in the same small courtyard, if the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">fashioned </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a pi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> other did not fashion a pit, those who fashioned a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pit are permitted </span>to pour their waste water into the courtyard, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">those who did not fashion a pit are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited </span>to do so.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that a courtyard four by four cubits in area does not require a pit? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: Because a person ordinarily uses two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of water a day, </span>and with regard to a courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>by four cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">a person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wants to sprinkle </span>the water on the ground to prevent any dust from rising. Consequently, even if in practice the water does flow out of the courtyard, this effect is not necessarily his intention. 

Daf 88b

But if the courtyard is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than four cubits </span>by four cubits in area, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>simply <span class="gemarra-regular">pours </span>the water out, as the place is not fit for sprinkling. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">if one fashioned a pit, it is permitted </span>to pour out water; but if <span class="gemarra-regular">not, it is prohibited </span>to do so, as one certainly intends for the water to flow outside. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira </span>offered a different reason and <span class="gemarra-regular">said:</span> In a courtyard of <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>by four cubits, the water is likely to be <span class="gemarra-regular">absorbed </span>into the ground. If it is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than four cubits </span>in size, the water <span class="gemarra-regular">will not be absorbed </span>but will flow out.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the practical <span class="gemarra-regular">difference between </span>these two explanations? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: There is </span>a difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with regard to a <span class="gemarra-regular">long and narro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> courtyard. As the area of this courtyard is also sixteen square cubits, it likewise absorbs the water. Rabbi Zeira would therefore rule that it does not require a pit. However, as this courtyard is not in need of sprinkling, it requires a pit according to Rabba.
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">A courtyard and a portico combine for the </span>requisite <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits, </span>permitted the pouring of water into a courtyard that lacks a pit. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">works out well, </span>as the total area is large enough to absorb the water. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to Rabba it is difficult, </span>for when the courtyard is joined with the portico it is no longer in the shape of a square, and it is therefore unfit for sprinkling. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Zeira explained </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, </span>by saying that it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a portico that extends along the entire courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that it adds to its width alone. Consequently, the courtyard and the portico together form a square of four by four cubits, an area that is fit for sprinkling. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that can decide this dispute. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard that is not four</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits by four cubits </span>in area, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not pour</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> water into it on Shabbat. </span>The Gemara assumes that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which teaches that one may pour water only into a courtyard that it is four by four cubits, is precise in its wording. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to Rabba, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">works out well, </span>as he maintains that it is prohibited to pour water into a long and narrow courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Zeira, </span>who maintains that the critical factor is the area of the courtyard, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult.</span>
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you: </span>In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span>is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis </span>at the end of the mishna, who maintain that the area of the courtyard is of no importance, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas </span><span class="gemarra-regular">our </span>unattributed <span class="gemarra-regular">mishna is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, </span>according to whom the area is the decisive factor.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what forced Rabbi Zeira to establish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Ya’akov</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rava said: The mishna was difficult </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for him. Why </span>did the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically teach </span>his ruling with respect to <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard that is less </span>than four cubits, from which it can be inferred that if it has an area of four by four cubits it is permitted to pour water, even if it is not square in shape? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: A courtyard that is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not four cubits by four cubits, </span>i.e., one that is not square shaped, even if it includes an area of sixteen square cubits.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, shouldn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t one conclude from this </span>argument that the unattributed section of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov? </span>The Gemara summarizes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>that it is so.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with this conclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">But from </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">a latter clause </span>of the mishna explicitly cites the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, </span>it can be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>represent the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</span>
The Gemara rejects this argument: In fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Eliezer ben Ya’akov, and </span>as for its problematic style, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete and it teaches the following: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard that is less than four cubits</span> in area, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not pour </span>waste <span class="gemarra-regular">water into it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat. Consequently, </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>in area, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may pour </span>water into it, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Eliezer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Ya’akov says: </span>If the first <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>drainage <span class="gemarra-regular">ditch were arched over in the public domain, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one may pour </span>waste <span class="gemarra-regular">water into it on Shabbat. </span>
We learned in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Ya’akov says: </span>If the first four cubits of a drainage <span class="gemarra-regular">ditch were arched over </span>in the public domain, it is permitted to pour waste water into it on Shabbat. However, the Rabbis say: One may pour water only upon the roof, from which it will spill into the drain of its own accord.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna</span> was <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>taught <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. For it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Even </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a roof one hundred cubits </span>in area, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not pour </span>water onto it, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a roof is not apt to absorb </span>the water. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it </span>causes it <span class="gemarra-regular">to run off. </span>Consequently, pouring water onto this roof is equivalent to pouring it directly outside.
A <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement, </span>that a pit is required, <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> In the summer, but in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the rainy season</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one may pour and repeat, and </span>he need <span class="gemarra-regular">not hold back. What is the reason? Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: A person is </span>equally <span class="gemarra-regular">willing for the water to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be absorbed on the spot, </span>i.e., as there is abundant water in the courtyard during the rainy season, it will remain muddy in any case, and he therefore does not care whether the added waste water remains in the courtyard or if it flows out. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">waste </span>water poured into a drainage ditch, <span class="gemarra-regular">that a person wants it to be absorbed </span>in the ditch itself, rather than flow out, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not pour </span>water into the ditch. 
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: There, </span>during the rainy season, there is no reason to prohibit the practice, for <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to what need we be concerned? If </span>you say he wants the water to flow out into the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>he is concerned about <span class="gemarra-regular">spoiling </span>and sullying <span class="gemarra-regular">his courtyard, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">already spoiled </span>by the rainwater. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>you say it should be prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a decree lest </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">so-and-so’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gutter is flowing with water </span>on Shabbat, which might lead them to think he is watering his garden or violating some other prohibition, and they might act likewise even in the summer, this is not a relevant concern. As <span class="gemarra-regular">gutters </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ordinarily flow </span>with water in the rainy season, people do not entertain this suspicion. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: In the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rainy season, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit that holds two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, we grant him </span>permission to pour <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’a</span> of water into it. If it <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, we grant him one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the summer, </span>if the pit has a capacity of <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, we grant him two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>if it holds only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, we do not grant him</span> permission to pour any water <span class="gemarra-regular">at all.</span>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">In the hot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> season as well, </span>if the pit <span class="gemarra-regular">holds one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, let us grant him one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>for if he pours only this amount of water, it will not flow out into the public domain. The Gemara answers: This is prohibited due to <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree lest he come to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">put two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into it. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so, in the rainy season let us also apply the </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">preventive measure.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the rainy season, there is no reason to prohibit the practice, for if one pours more water into a pit than it can take, <span class="gemarra-regular">about what need we be concerned? If </span>you say he wants the waste water to flow out into the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>he is concerned about <span class="gemarra-regular">spoiling </span>his courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is already spoiled </span>by the rainwater. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>you say it should be prohibited due to <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">so-and-so’s gutter is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">flowing with water </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">gutters ordinarily gush </span>with water in the rainy season, as stated above. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Therefore, </span>in accordance with this reasoning, one can pour <span class="gemarra-regular">even a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">even two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ko</span><span class="gemarra-italic">r</span> of waste water into a small pit. As all gutters flow with water in the rainy season, there is no cause for any concern.
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upper stories, one opposite the other </span>in the same courtyard, the residents of the one who dug a pit in the courtyard may pour water into it, while the residents of the other one who did not dig a pit in the courtyard are prohibited from doing so. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>the residents of the two upper stories <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What is the reason </span>for this ruling? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the increase </span>in the amount <span class="gemarra-regular">of water, </span>as two upper stories pour out more water than one, <span class="gemarra-regular">wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The same </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit, and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> same </span>applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">a cracked </span>earthenware <span class="gemarra-regular">vessel </span>used as a receptacle for water, or a small <span class="gemarra-regular">pond, or a basin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Even though they were </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">filled with water on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eve, one may pour water into them on Shabbat. </span>It is evident from here that as long as the pit is the requisite size, there is no concern about the amount of water that will flow out from it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if it was stated it was stated as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> follows. Rava said: </span>

Daf 89a

<span class="gemarra-regular">They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the residents of the two upper stories <span class="gemarra-regular">did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if they established</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span>joint <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular">they are </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to pour water into the courtyard.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And where they did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the reason </span>that the residents who did not dig a pit may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>pour water into the courtyard? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree, lest </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to take out vessels </span>filled with water <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">houses </span><span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>the courtyard, to pour into the pit. In the absence of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, this practice is prohibited. 

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">All the roofs of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> are considered <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> domain. </span>It is permitted to carry from one roof to another, even if the residents of the houses did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> between them. The Sages did not prohibit carrying between roofs, as it is rare to transfer an item from one roof to another. However, it is only permitted to transfer objects between roofs <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">roof</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is neither ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">higher nor ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">lower </span>than the adjacent roof. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And the Rabbis say: Each and every one </span>of the roofs is <span class="gemarra-regular">a domain in and of itself. </span>It is permitted to carry from one to the other only if the residents of both houses established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: Roofs, courtyards, and enclosure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all one domain with regard to vessels that were inside</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>began, and one may therefore carry from one of these areas to another. However, they are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>one domain <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to vessels that were inside </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the house </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>began and were later taken into one of the above domains. A vessel that was inside the house when Shabbat began and subsequently carried to one of these areas may be carried from one roof, courtyard, or enclosure to another only if an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> had been established between the domains.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Avin and Rabbi Ḥanina bar Avin were sitting, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abaye was sitting beside them, and they sat and said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Granted, the Rabbis maintain: Just as residents are divided </span>into separate domains <span class="gemarra-regular">below, </span>and they may not carry from house to house without an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">so are residents divided </span>into separate domains <span class="gemarra-regular">above, </span>on the rooftops, and it is prohibited to carry from one roof to another without an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, Rabbi Meir, what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does he maintain; </span>what is the rationale for his opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">If he maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as residents are divided </span>into separate domains <span class="gemarra-regular">below, so are residents divided </span>into separate domains <span class="gemarra-regular">above, why, </span>in his opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">are they </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domain? And if he maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are not divided</span> into separate domains, <span class="gemarra-regular">as any </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">above ten </span>handbreadths off the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">one domain, even </span>if a <span class="gemarra-regular">roof</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">higher or ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">lower </span>than the adjacent roof, it should <span class="gemarra-regular">likewise </span>be permitted to carry from one roof to the other.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to them: </span>Have <span class="gemarra-regular">you not heard that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: Any place that you find two domains, </span>i.e., places set apart from each other by disparity in height or by boundaries, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">they are </span>halakhically <span class="gemarra-regular">one domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for example, a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pillar ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high and four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide </span>situated <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a private domain, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to adjust </span>a burden on one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">shoulders upon it, </span>by rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the concern lest he come to do the same thing on <span class="gemarra-regular">a mound in the public domain. </span>The legal status of a mound ten handbreadths high and four handbreadths wide located in a public domain is that of a private domain. In that case, it is prohibited by Torah law to transfer an object from the public domain to the mound. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>in the case of roofs, Rabbi Meir prohibited transferring objects between roofs with a height disparity of ten handbreadths, by rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree, due to </span>the concern lest one come to transfer an object from the public domain to <span class="gemarra-regular">a mound in a public domain. </span>
Abaye and Ḥanina bar Avin <span class="gemarra-regular">understood </span>by inference <span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>ruling that in the opinion of Rabbi Meir, it would be prohibited to adjust one’s burden <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span> on <span class="gemarra-regular">a mortar and even </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">a vat </span>that were overturned in a private domain and that are large enough to constitute private domains in their own right. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to them: The Master, </span>Rabba, <span class="gemarra-regular">said as follows: Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Meir spoke only </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pillar or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>raised <span class="gemarra-regular">base of a millstone. Since a person fixes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a place for them </span>they are comparable to a mound in a public domain in that they are rarely moved. However, the Sages did not issue a decree in the case of portable objects. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty. There is the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a wall that is between two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> courtyards, which </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">fixed, and </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: When</span> you analyze the matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">you will find </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">according to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Meir </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">roofs </span>form a single <span class="gemarra-regular">domain in and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of themselves, </span>and likewise all <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyards </span>form a single <span class="gemarra-regular">domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in and of themselves, </span>and all <span class="gemarra-regular">enclosures </span>form a single <span class="gemarra-regular">domain in and of themselves</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>It is permitted to carry from one courtyard to another, although it is not permitted to carry from a courtyard to a roof.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not that it is permitted to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">move </span>objects from one courtyard to another <span class="gemarra-regular">via a </span>dividing <span class="gemarra-regular">wall, </span>even though it is ten handbreadths high? This poses a difficulty to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, who prohibits the transfer of an object from one place to a place ten handbreadths higher or lower.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: No, </span>that explanation is incorrect, as Rav Yehuda meant to say that according to Rabbi Meir it is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to carry in and carry </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out </span>between one courtyard and another, or from one enclosure to another, <span class="gemarra-regular">via </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">openings </span>between them. However, Rabbi Meir concedes that one may not transfer objects over the wall that separates the two domains, as the wall is considered a domain in and of itself.
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">each and every one</span> of the roofs <span class="gemarra-regular">is a domain in and of itself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. It was stated </span>that <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed about the following issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>According to the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may move</span> objects on each roof <span class="gemarra-regular">only within four cubits. </span>As, according to the Rabbis, the legal status of roofs is like that of courtyards, in that it is prohibited to carry from one roof to another, and each roof is fully open to a domain into which carrying is prohibited. Therefore, it is also prohibited to carry objects farther than four cubits on each roof. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: It is permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to move </span>objects throughout each <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>roof.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">partitions that are conspicuous, </span>i.e., detached houses whose walls are distinct, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that it is permitted to carry throughout each roof. <span class="gemarra-regular">Where they disagree </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">partitions that are not conspicuous, </span>i.e., attached houses, which appear as though they share a common roof although they are owned by different people. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: One may carry </span>on each roof <span class="gemarra-regular">only within four cubits. </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">does not state </span>the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">Extend and raise the partitions </span>between the houses below, which states that the walls of the houses are considered to extend upward and create partitions between the roofs. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to carry throughout </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he states </span>the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">Extend and raise the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">partitions.</span>
The Gemara asks a question based on that which <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the mishna: And <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">each and every one </span>of the roofs

Daf 89b

is <span class="gemarra-regular">a domain in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and of itself. </span>This indicates that each roof constitutes a discrete domain, and one may carry throughout this entire domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, </span>this works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well, but according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult.</span>
The Gemara answers that the Sages of the <span class="gemarra-regular">school of Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said in the name of Rav: </span>The ruling in the mishna is not a leniency permitting one to carry throughout the entire roof; rather, it is a stringency, ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one may not move </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">two cubits on this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">roof and two cubits on that roof. </span>The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> rules that even the allowance to carry within four cubits is restricted to a single roof. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Elazar say: When we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were in Babylonia we </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the Sages of <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Rav said in the name of Rav: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One may move </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>each roof <span class="gemarra-regular">only within </span><span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits, and those </span>Sages of <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taugh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in accordance with their opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">They have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only their </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">roof.</span>
The Gemara seeks to clarify this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of the statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">They have only their </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">roof? </span>Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that they are permitted to move </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>roof? This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> poses a difficulty to Rav. The Gemara rejects this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> any <span class="gemarra-regular">stronger </span>a proof <span class="gemarra-regular">than our mishna, which we established </span>as a stringency, <span class="gemarra-regular">that one may not move </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">two cubits </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on this roof and two cubits on that roof? So </span><span class="gemarra-regular">too, </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is teaching that one may not carry <span class="gemarra-regular">two cubits on this roof and two cubits on that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> roof</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said, </span>after an illness had caused him to forget his knowledge: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">heard this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of Shmuel’s with regard to roofs. His student <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: You </span>yourself <span class="gemarra-regular">said it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to us, and it was about this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it to us: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a large roof that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is adjacent to a small one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> carrying on <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted, </span>as its partitions are distinct where it extends beyond the small one, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>carrying on <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">small one is prohibited, </span>as it is breached along its entire length into the other roof, onto which it is prohibited to carry. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And you said to us about it: Rav Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: They only taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are residents on this </span>roof <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">residents on that </span>roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the extended, virtual partition <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the small </span>roof is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a trampled partition. </span>The residents trample this virtual partition as they move from one roof to the other, and the entire length of the small roof is considered breached into the large one. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">there are no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> residents on this </span>roof <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>none <span class="gemarra-regular">on that </span>one, carrying on <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>roofs is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. </span>Presumably, Shmuel’s reasoning is that in this case the walls of the houses below extend upward and form partitions between the roofs, in accordance with the principle: Extend and raise the partitions.
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>I remember it now. <span class="gemarra-regular">I said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to you as follows: They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, that carrying is prohibited on the small roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there was an </span>actual <span class="gemarra-regular">partition on </span>all sides of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>roof <span class="gemarra-regular">and an </span>actual <span class="gemarra-regular">partition on </span>all sides of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>roof, not only between the two roofs. In <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, carrying on <span class="gemarra-regular">the large </span>roof <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">the remnants </span>of the partition on either side of the opening, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>carrying on the <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>roof <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>prohibited because it is <span class="gemarra-regular">fully breached </span>into the larger one. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if there is no partition, neither on </span>all sides of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>roof <span class="gemarra-regular">nor on </span>all sides of <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> roof, carrying on <span class="gemarra-regular">both of them is prohibited.</span>
Abaye raised a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t you speak to us </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">residents? </span>Rav Yosef replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">If I spoke to you </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">residents, this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">I said to you: They taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, that carrying is prohibited on the small roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is an </span>actual <span class="gemarra-regular">partition </span>that renders the area <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for residence on </span>all sides of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span>actual <span class="gemarra-regular">partition </span>that renders the area fit <span class="gemarra-regular">for residence</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on </span>all sides of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>roof, as carrying on <span class="gemarra-regular">the large </span>roof <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">the remnants </span>of the partition on either side of the opening, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>carrying on the <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>roof <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>prohibited because it is <span class="gemarra-regular">fully breached </span>into the larger one. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a partition </span>that renders the area fit <span class="gemarra-regular">for a residence on </span>all sides of <span class="gemarra-regular">the large </span>roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>partition that renders the area fit for <span class="gemarra-regular">a residence on the small </span>roof, carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the small </span>roof <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted for the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">residents of the large </span>roof. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the residents of the small roof <span class="gemarra-regular">did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> erect a partition </span>around their roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">removed themselves</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from here </span>and transferred the right to their domain to the residents of the large roof.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with that which Rav Naḥman said: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">affixed a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permanent ladder to his roof, </span>while the owners of the neighboring roofs did not do so, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him to </span>carry on <span class="gemarra-regular">all the roofs. </span>The failure of the other owners to erect a ladder indicates that they relinquished the right to their roofs to the one who affixed the permanent ladder.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>If a person <span class="gemarra-regular">built</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an upper story atop his house, </span>by surrounding the roof with walls, <span class="gemarra-regular">and erected before its </span>entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">a small partition</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dakka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] four </span>cubits high that opens to other roofs, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>carry on <span class="gemarra-regular">all the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">roofs. </span>His construction of the partition is indicative of his plans to utilize the other roofs, while the failure of the other owners to do so indicates that they conceded use of their roofs to him. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Sometimes the small</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> partition </span>leads <span class="gemarra-regular">to prohibition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What are the circumstances </span>of this case? It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the partition <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> erected </span>facing <span class="gemarra-regular">toward the garden of his house </span>and the sides facing the other roofs were sealed. The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>through his actions <span class="gemarra-regular">he said</span>

Daf 90a

<span class="gemarra-regular">that he built </span>the upper story <span class="gemarra-regular">to protect</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the garden [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tarbitza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> not to access the roofs. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama raised a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dilemma: </span>According to Rav, who holds that one may carry only within four cubits on each roof, if he carries an object <span class="gemarra-regular">two cubits on a roof and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits on a pillar </span>ten handbreadths high and four handbreadths wide adjacent to the roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">is he raising a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dilemma? </span>Is it with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> private domai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is raising a dilemma? </span>The roof is a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> and the pillar is a private domain; certainly carrying from one to the other is prohibited.
The Gemara explains that this was not in fact the dilemma, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rami bar Ḥama, due </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to his keen </span>mind, <span class="gemarra-regular">did not analyze </span>the dilemma carefully and was imprecise in its formulation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, this is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma he is raising: </span>If one carries an object <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits on the roof </span>of a house, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits on </span>the slanted roof of <span class="gemarra-regular">a portico</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a roofed structure without walls, before a house belonging to someone else, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? 
The Gemara elaborates on Rami bar Ḥama’s dilemma: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since neither this </span>roof <span class="gemarra-regular">is fit for residence, nor is this </span>portico roof <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for residence, it is </span>regarded as <span class="gemarra-regular">one domain, </span>and therefore carrying between them is permitted? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps since </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">from a roof to </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">roof is prohibited, </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a roof to a portico is likewise prohibited, </span>as the latter is also a domain in and of itself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Abaye raised a </span>similar <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: </span>If one carries <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits on the roof </span>of a house <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits </span>on the roof <span class="gemarra-regular">of a ruin </span>belonging to someone else, one side of which was completely open to a public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Is that not </span>precisely the same dilemma raised <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rami</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Ḥama </span>with regard to a portico? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abaye said: And did I come late </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">me’aḥ</span><span class="gemarra-italic">er</span>] merely <span class="gemarra-regular">to quarrel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and meddle in other people’s questions? That is not the case, as the two dilemmas are not identical. <span class="gemarra-regular">A portico is not fit for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">residence, while a ruin is fit for residence. </span>Therefore, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> might differ in each case.
The Gemara is surprised by this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And now that it is fit for residence, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what dilemma is he raising? </span>The situation is comparable to the case of two standard roofs. The Gemara answers: Rav Beivai was unaware of the resolution to the dilemma raised by Rami bar Ḥama, and therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">he states </span>the dilemma employing the style: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say. If you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a portico is not fit for residence, </span>and therefore carrying is permitted, it can be argued that as <span class="gemarra-regular">a ruin </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is fit for residence, </span>the legal status of its roof should be like that of a standard roof. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>that is not the case, as <span class="gemarra-regular">now in any event </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there are no residents in </span>the ruin, and therefore its roof is not comparable to a standard roof. No resolution was found for these dilemmas, and they <span class="gemarra-regular">stand </span>unresolved.
The Gemara discusses a different question. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">roofs that are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> level, </span>i.e., with a height disparity of less than ten handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an isolated roof </span>that does not border other roofs, <span class="gemarra-regular">according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, Rav said: It is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted to move </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout the entire </span>roof; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Shmuel said: One may move </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">in it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">only within four </span>cubits. 
The Gemara seeks to clarify the conflicting opinions. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted to move </span>objects <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>roof. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>as there is an apparent contradiction between one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav and </span>another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav. </span>With regard to level roofs, Rav said that according to the Rabbis one may carry on each roof only within four cubits. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of a roof among roofs, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>inner <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions </span>between the houses <span class="gemarra-regular">are not conspicuous, </span>and therefore, are not taken into consideration. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>outer <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions </span>of a single house or group of houses <span class="gemarra-regular">are conspicuous, </span>meaning that they are considered to extend upward and delineate the edge of the roof.
The Gemara returns to discuss Shmuel’s ruling. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: One may carry only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">within four </span>cubits. Once again, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>as there is an apparent contradiction between one statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel and </span>another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel, </span>who said that in the case of level roofs, according to the Rabbis one may carry throughout each separate roof. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the area of the roof <span class="gemarra-regular">is no greater than two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">is greater than two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And these partitions </span>of the house <span class="gemarra-regular">were erected</span> for use <span class="gemarra-regular">below </span>as partitions for the residence itself; <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were not erected to </span>serve as partitions for use on the roof <span class="gemarra-regular">above. </span>Consequently, even if the walls are viewed as extending upward so that they constitute surrounding partitions for the roof, the legal status of the roof is <span class="gemarra-regular">like</span> that of <span class="gemarra-regular">an enclosure greater than two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was not enclosed </span>from the outset for the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">residence; and </span>the principle is that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any enclosure greater than two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not enclosed </span>from the outset <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">residence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, one may move </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">in it only within four</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>that these same <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>large <span class="gemarra-regular">ship. Rav said: It is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted to move </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout </span>the entire ship, as it is all one domain; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Shmuel said: One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may move </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">in it only within four </span>cubits. The Gemara proceeds to clarify their respective opinions. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: It is permitted to move </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout </span>the boat, 

Daf 90b

<span class="gemarra-regular">as there are partitions. And Shmuel said: One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may move </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">in it only within four cubits,</span> as <span class="gemarra-regular">the partitions </span>of the ship are not considered full-fledged partitions; they <span class="gemarra-regular">are erected </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">to keep water out</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> not to render it a residence.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Yosef said to Shmuel: </span>Is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with your </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav? </span>Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as his rationale is more convincing.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Giddel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef said: And Rav concedes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that if one overturned </span>the ship <span class="gemarra-regular">onto its mouth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and it is more than ten handbreadths high, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one may move </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">on it only within four </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">For what </span>purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>the ship <span class="gemarra-regular">overturned? If you say </span>it was overturned so <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">reside beneath it, what is the difference </span>between it and <span class="gemarra-regular">an isolated roof? </span>The legal status of the overturned ship should in every sense be that of a house, and therefore it should be permitted to carry throughout the entire ship. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be <span class="gemarra-regular">that he overturned it to tar it, </span>i.e., to add a fresh coat to its underside. In that case, the boat certainly does not serve as a residence, and its sides are not considered full-fledged partitions. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ashi teaches </span>Shmuel’s acceptance of Rav’s opposing view (Ritva) with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to a ship, </span>as stated above; <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, teaches it </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a portico</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it was stated </span>that <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a portico </span>located <span class="gemarra-regular">in a field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> A portico has a roof and either incomplete walls or no walls. Consequently, in the case of a portico located in a valley, which is a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, it remains to be determined whether or not it is permitted to carry in it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: It is permitted to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">move </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout the entire </span>portico, as it is a private domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: One may move </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">in it only within four </span>cubits.
The Gemara elaborates. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: It is permitted to move </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout the entire </span>portico, as <span class="gemarra-regular">we say: The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">edge of the roof descends </span>to the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">and seals </span>the portico on all sides, rendering it a private domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: One may move </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">in it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only within four </span>cubits, as <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say: The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> edge of the roof descends </span>to the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">and seals</span> the portico. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav’s </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Meir </span>that one is permitted to carry from one roof to another if they are level, it should also be permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">carry from a roof to a courtyard. </span>Why then does Rabbi Meir rule that roofs and courtyards are separate domains and that carrying between them is prohibited? The Gemara answers: It is prohibited because Rabbi Meir issued <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree, due </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi. </span>As stated previously, Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi rules that one may not transfer objects between two halakhically equivalent but physically distinct domains ten or more handbreadths high. This is a decree lest one standing in a public domain adjust a burden on a mound ten handbreadths high and four handbreadths wide, which is a private domain, an act prohibited by Torah law. 
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel’s</span> statement <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis </span>that the legal status of an isolated roof greater than two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> is that of a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, it should be permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to move </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>an isolated <span class="gemarra-regular">roof</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to an enclosure </span>within four cubits of the roof, as the legal status of the enclosure is also that of a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>. Why then do the Rabbis rule that roofs and enclosures are separate domains and carrying from one to the other is prohibited? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava bar Ulla said: </span>It is prohibited because the Rabbis issued <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree lest the </span>area of the <span class="gemarra-regular">roof diminis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> to less than two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, in which case it would assume the status of a private domain, as it is prohibited to carry between a private domain and an enclosure.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, one should also </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">move </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">from one enclosure </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">enclosure, </span>due to the concern that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the area of one of the enclosures will <span class="gemarra-regular">diminish </span>and become a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">move </span>an object from one to the other as before. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, if </span>the enclosure <span class="gemarra-regular">is diminished, the matter is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> conspicuous, </span>as its walls are clearly visible. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">if</span> the roof <span class="gemarra-regular">is diminished, the matter is not conspicuous, </span>as the roof does not have walls.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: </span>After careful analysis, <span class="gemarra-regular">you will find </span>that you can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the statement of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, roofs are a domain in and of themselves, </span>and one may carry from one roof to another; and likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyards are </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a domain in and of themselves, </span>and one may likewise carry from one courtyard to another. 

Daf 91a

Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">enclosures are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a domain in and of themselves, </span>and one is therefore permitted to carry from one enclosure to another. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of the Rabbis, roofs and courtyards </span>constitute <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domain, </span>and therefore, one may carry even from a roof to a courtyard; however, <span class="gemarra-regular">enclosures are one </span>discrete <span class="gemarra-regular">domain. According </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the statement of Rabbi Shimon, all of them, </span>roofs, courtyards, and enclosures, <span class="gemarra-regular">are one domain, </span>and therefore it is permitted to carry between any of them.
The Gemara comments: A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, </span>and a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda. </span>The Gemara elaborates. A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, </span>that according to the Rabbis one may carry only four cubits on each roof: <span class="gemarra-regular">All the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">roofs of a city are one domain, and it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to carry </span>objects <span class="gemarra-regular">up or carry </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">down, from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the roofs to the courtyard or from the courtyard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the roofs. And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels that were inside </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>began, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted to carry </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them in the courtyard </span>even if an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was not established, and it is likewise permitted to carry them from that courtyard to other courtyards. With regard to vessels that were <span class="gemarra-regular">on the roofs </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>began, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to carry them on the roofs, provided that one roof</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is neither ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">higher nor ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">lower </span>than the other. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Rabbis say: Each and every one of </span>the roofs <span class="gemarra-regular">is a domain in and of itself, and one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> move </span>objects <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>each roof <span class="gemarra-regular">only within four </span>cubits. 
Likewise, a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught in accordance with Rav Yehuda’s </span>interpretation of the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: When we were studying Torah with Rabbi Shimon in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Tekoa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we would carry oil </span>for smearing <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">towel </span>for drying <span class="gemarra-regular">from roof to roof, and from roof </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to courtyard, and from courtyard to courtyard, and from courtyard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to enclosure, and from enclosure to enclosure, </span>to refrain from carrying in a prohibited place, <span class="gemarra-regular">until we reached the spring</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in which we would bathe.</span>
And similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> during a time of danger, </span>when decrees were issued that banned religious observance, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we would carry a Torah </span><span class="gemarra-regular">scroll from courtyard to roof, and from roof to courtyard, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and from courtyard to enclosure, to read from it. </span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> cannot be determined from that incident, as an incident occurring during <span class="gemarra-regular">a time of danger is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">no proof. </span>At a time of danger it is permitted to carry even in places where carrying is ordinarily prohibited by rabbinic law. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: Roofs, </span>courtyards, and enclosures are <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>one domain with regard to vessels that were inside them when Shabbat began, and one may therefore carry from one of these areas to the other. However, they are not one domain with regard to vessels that were inside the house when Shabbat began.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> provided that </span>the residents of each courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not establish a </span>separate <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for themselves, as in that case they may not move objects from their houses into the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if they established </span>a separate <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for each courtyard, without establishing an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> between the various courtyards, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>that is not the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we issue </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a decree lest one come to take out vessels </span>from one <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">houses to the courtyard, </span>an action that is fundamentally permitted, and subsequently proceed to carry them out to a different courtyard with which an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> had not been established, which everyone agrees is prohibited. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether they established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or whether they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And similarly Rabbi Yoḥanan said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Who whispered to you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who told you that there is a difference <span class="gemarra-regular">whether they established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or whether</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥisda strongly objects to this </span>ruling. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">will say </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">two vessels </span>located <span class="gemarra-regular">in the same courtyard, </span>one of which was in the courtyard when Shabbat began while the other was in the house, that moving <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one, which was in the courtyard at the start of Shabbat, to another courtyard is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted, while </span>moving <span class="gemarra-regular">that one, </span>which was in the house at the start of Shabbat, to another courtyard, is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>
The Gemara answers: In this regard, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as he did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not issue a decree </span>due to these concerns. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in a mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon said: To what is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this matter comparable? </span>It is comparable <span class="gemarra-regular">to three courtyards that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are open into each other, and that are </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">open </span><span class="gemarra-regular">into a public domain. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the two outer </span>courtyards each <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with the middle one, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for the residents of the middle one to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>the two outer ones, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they, </span>the residents of the two outer ones, <span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted </span>to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">into it, but</span> for the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the two outer </span>courtyards it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">into each other, </span>as they did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> together. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in that case Rabbi Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">did not issue a decree </span>prohibiting one to carry objects from the middle courtyard to one of the outer ones <span class="gemarra-regular">lest one come to take out vessels from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>outer <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard to that </span>outer <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, </span>despite the fact that both sets of vessels are located in the middle courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, we do not issue a decree lest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one come to take out utensils </span>from one <span class="gemarra-regular">of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> houses to the courtyard, </span>and carry them to a different courtyard. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet raised an objection. </span>We learned in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: Roofs, courtyards, and enclosures are all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one domain with regard to vessels that were inside them </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>began. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>one domain <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to vessels that were inside the house </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat</span> began. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that it is dealing with a case where the residents of the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">established </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, that is how you find vessels </span>that were taken <span class="gemarra-regular">from the house in the courtyard. </span>Because those vessels were in the house at the beginning of Shabbat, they may not be moved to a different courtyard. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, if you say </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>under <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>circumstances can the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels from the house </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the courtyard </span>be found? This poses a difficulty for Rav. Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">raised the objection, and he resolved it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>It refers <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a hat or a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shawl, </span>which one wore in the house and subsequently went out to the courtyard and placed it there. In this manner, it is possible that objects taken from the house can be found in the courtyard, even if an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was not established. 

Daf 91b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the residents of </span>houses that open directly into <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> courtyard and the residents of </span>upper stories that open onto <span class="gemarra-regular">a balcony </span>from which stairs lead down to that courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">who forgot and did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> between them, <span class="gemarra-regular">anything ten handbreadths high </span>in the courtyard, e.g., a mound or a pillar, is attributed <span class="gemarra-regular">to the balcony</span> in terms of its use on Shabbat. The residents of the balcony may move objects between the mound or pillar and their apartments. Anything <span class="gemarra-regular">lower than that </span>is attributed <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the courtyard. In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement, </span>that it is prohibited for the residents of the courtyard to carry to the balcony and vice versa, <span class="gemarra-regular">stated? </span>It is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the residents of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">many, and </span>the residents of the balcony were <span class="gemarra-regular">many, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for themselves, and those established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for themselves; or </span>if the courtyard and the balcony were occupied by <span class="gemarra-regular">individuals who need not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for themselves.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if the residents of the courtyard and the balcony <span class="gemarra-regular">were many, and they forgot and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for their courtyard or balcony, in that case <span class="gemarra-regular">roof, and courtyard, and portico, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">balcony are all one domain, </span>and it is permitted to carry from one to another any vessels that were located in any one of them when Shabbat began. 
The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>that carrying between them is permitted is <span class="gemarra-regular">that they did not </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span>their own <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>however, if <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">established </span>their own <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, no, </span>it is prohibited to carry between them. This inference supports Rav and poses a difficulty for Shmuel. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is represented by <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who maintain that roofs and courtyards form a single domain, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. The Rabbis indeed issued a decree that carrying is prohibited if each group established a separate <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. 
The Gemara comments: The language of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise, as it is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teaching </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">an enclosure and an alleyway, </span>in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, but only the cases of a roof and a courtyard, in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from here </span>that this is the correct understanding. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>from another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">five courtyards that are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> open to each othe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and are </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">open to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway, and </span>the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is prohibited to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">carry in or carry out, from a courtyard to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">alleyway or from the alleyway to a courtyard. And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels that were in the courtyard </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>began, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted to carry them in the courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but in the alleyway it is prohibited </span>to carry them. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon permits </span>doing so, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Shimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would say: Whenever </span>the courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>in the possession <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> many </span>people, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they forgot and did not establish an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">roof, and courtyard, and portico, and balcony, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enclosure, and alleyway are all one domain. </span>These areas are all classified as private domains, and therefore, it is permitted to carry from one to the other. 
The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>that carrying between them is permitted is <span class="gemarra-regular">that they did not </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span>their own <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>however, if <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">established</span> their own <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, no, </span>it is prohibited to carry between them. This inference supports Rav and poses a difficulty for Shmuel. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">They did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It means that the residents of the <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyards did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with each other; however, the </span>residents of each <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> with the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the houses </span>inside it, and it is nevertheless permitted to carry between them, in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel.
The Gemara raises a difficulty. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">doesn’t </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">state: They did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> indicating that they did not establish any <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> at all, either with the residents of the other courtyard or within each courtyard? The Gemara rejects this argument. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">They did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It means that <span class="gemarra-regular">they did not merge </span>the courtyards facing the alleyway. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon is speaking </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the Rabbis in accordance with their </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">opinion, </span>not enumerating the leniencies inherent in his own ruling. His statement should therefore be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to my own </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no difference </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and there is no difference </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">they did not establish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. However, according to your </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">agree with me </span><span class="gemarra-regular">at least that </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is </span>all considered <span class="gemarra-regular">one domain.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis said to him: No, </span>although we agree with you in the cases of a roof, courtyard, portico, and balcony, in the cases of an enclosure and an alleyway we disagree, as <span class="gemarra-regular">they are two domains </span>and therefore it is prohibited to carry from one to the other.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>above in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Vessels that were in a courtyard at the start of Shabbat may be carried within the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">but in the alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is prohibited. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that this <span class="gemarra-regular">supports that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as Rabbi Zeira said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in which they did not merge </span>the courtyards facing it, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may carry only within four cubits. </span>The Gemara rejects this suggestion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> means: <span class="gemarra-regular">But to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an alleyway it is prohibited, </span>i.e., it is prohibited to carry from the courtyard to the alleyway; however, within the alleyway itself it is permitted to carry. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">that is </span>identical to <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> would not have taught the very same thing twice. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>apparently <span class="gemarra-regular">superfluous </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teachin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was necessary, lest you say: When the Rabbis </span><span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with Rabbi Shimon, it is only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">concede to </span>Rabbi Meir that it is all considered one domain and carrying is permitted. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Shimon in both cases, as they prohibit carrying in the alleyway even if the residents did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rav Ashi: </span>

Daf 92a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Did Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this, </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with Rabbi Shimon’s opinion that all courtyards constitute a single domain, even if each courtyard established an independent <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with an unattributed mishna, and we learned: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a wall between two courtyards, ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">wide, they establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one for each courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they do not establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">there was fruit atop </span>the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">these, </span>the residents of one courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">may ascend from here and eat </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">those, </span>the residents of the other courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">may ascend from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there and eat </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that they do not take </span>the fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">down </span>from atop the wall to the courtyards. According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, all the courtyards are considered a single domain. Why may they not bring the fruit down? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of the word <span class="gemarra-regular">down </span>in this context? It means <span class="gemarra-regular">down to the houses; </span>however, it is indeed permitted to bring the fruit down to the courtyards. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>in a <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Provided that neither will this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">stand </span>below <span class="gemarra-regular">in his place </span>in his courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and eat, nor </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">stand in his place </span>in his courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eat?</span>
Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Ravina: No proof can be cited from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> of Rabbi Ḥiyya with regard to the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">If Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">did not </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">teach i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in this manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where does </span>his student <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya </span>know it? If a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is not taught by the mishna itself, it should not be distorted to have it correspond with a <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> dispute the following case: If there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two courtyards and</span> there was <span class="gemarra-regular">one rui</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> between them, </span>and the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for themselves, while the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for themselves, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">confer </span>the right to utilize the ruin <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">that did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; however, to </span>the residents of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">that established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, no, </span>they do not confer the right to utilize the ruin. It is prohibited due to a decree, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest people come to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> take out vessels </span>from one <span class="gemarra-regular">of the houses to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ruin, </span>which is prohibited, as no <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> was established with the ruin itself. However, this concern does not extend to the courtyard whose residents did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. They are not permitted to move objects from their houses to the courtyard, and therefore there is no reason to issue a decree prohibiting the carrying of objects from the courtyard to the ruin. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Ḥiyya bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>disagreed with Rav Huna and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>Rights to the ruin are conferred <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the residents of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and consequently, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>courtyards to carry objects. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say</span> that it should be <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>to move articles to the ruin, that is incorrect. As if that were so, <span class="gemarra-regular">for what </span>reason did the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> confer </span>the right to carry in <span class="gemarra-regular">the courtyard that did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, to the </span>residents of the <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>If there is no cause for concern, it should always be permitted to the residents of a courtyard that established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> to carry from their courtyard to a different courtyard whose residents did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>.
The Gemara refutes this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of courtyards, <span class="gemarra-regular">since the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> vessels from the houses are protected in the courtyard </span>as well, there is a concern lest people <span class="gemarra-regular">come to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">take them out </span>from the house to the courtyard, where they could be confused with those vessels already in the courtyard, and they might come to move those objects into the other courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a ruin, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">since the vessels from the courtyard are not protected in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the ruin, </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>concern lest people <span class="gemarra-regular">come to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">take out </span>the vessels from the courtyard into the ruin. Therefore, it is possible that residents of both courtyards would be permitted to utilize the ruin. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>a different version of the previous discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥiyya bar Rav </span>disagreed with Rav Huna and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The ruin belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">even to </span>the residents of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">that established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>to carry in the ruin. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if you say </span>they should <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to do so in accordance with the argument presented above, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">do not confer </span>the right to carry in <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard that did not establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the </span>residents of the <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard that established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>this proof can be refuted. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, since the vessels from the houses are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> protected in the courtyard, the Sages did not permit </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">them, </span>due to the concern <span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">come to take</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them out </span>from the house to the courtyard and from there to the other courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a ruin, </span>the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">are not protected </span>in the ruin, and therefore, there is no cause for concern.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">a large roof </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">adjacent to a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> small </span><span class="gemarra-regular">roof</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the boundary between them was no wider than ten cubits, use of <span class="gemarra-regular">the large one is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted, </span>i.e., one may bring objects up to the roof from the house below and carry them on the roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>use of <span class="gemarra-regular">the small one is prohibited. </span>A similar <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">a large courtyard that was breached</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into a small </span>one, in a manner that one entire side of the small courtyard was breached, but the breach was less than ten cubits; it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the large </span>courtyard to carry, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the small one </span>to do so. The rationale for this difference is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>in that case, the legal status of the breach <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">the entrance of the large </span>courtyard. As the breach in the wall of the larger courtyard is surrounded on both sides by the remaining portions of that wall, and the breach is no greater than ten cubits wide, its legal status is like that of an entrance in the wall of the courtyard, and therefore it is permitted to carry in the large courtyard. With regard to the small courtyard, however, since one entire side of the small courtyard was breached, there remains no partition whatsoever on that side and carrying in that courtyard is therefore prohibited. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why does </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">twice</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Why is it necessary to repeat the ruling with regard to both roofs and courtyards when the cases are apparently identical? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, </span>with regard to the lenient ruling that the residents may carry on a roof, the repetition comes to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a roof similar to </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard: Just as a courtyard, its partitions are conspicuous, so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> too a roof, its </span>extended <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions, </span>based on the principle: Extend and raise the walls of the house, must be <span class="gemarra-regular">conspicuou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> for it to be permitted for the residents to carry on their account. In other words, the roof must not extend beyond the walls of the house. 
Whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, </span>the repetition should be understood in the opposite manner, as it comes to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a roof similar to</span> that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard: Just as a courtyard </span>is a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where multitudes tread, so too, the roof </span>is a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where multitudes tread. </span>However, if it is not used by many people, even the small roof is permitted, as the principle: Extend and raise the walls of the house, is applied to the wall between the houses, despite the fact that the partition is not conspicuous. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, Rabbi Zeira, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan were sitting, and Abaye was sitting</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> beside them, and they sat and said: Learn from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mishna </span>that the rights of <span class="gemarra-regular">the residents of the large</span> courtyard extend <span class="gemarra-regular">into the small one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>the rights of <span class="gemarra-regular">the residents of the small </span>courtyard do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>extend <span class="gemarra-regular">into the large one.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>If there are <span class="gemarra-regular">vines in the large </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to sow </span>crops <span class="gemarra-regular">in the small one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> even at a distance of four cubits, due to the prohibition against planting other food crops in a vineyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sowed </span>crops, <span class="gemarra-regular">the seeds are prohibited. </span>As the small courtyard is considered part of the large one, the vines in the larger courtyard render the seeds in the smaller courtyard prohibited. 

Daf 92b

<span class="gemarra-regular">The vines, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted, </span>as the small courtyard does not extend into and impact upon the large one. The converse is also true: If there are <span class="gemarra-regular">vines in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted to sow </span>other crops <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the large on</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, even if they are not planted four cubits away from the vines, because the vines are not considered to be located in the larger courtyard, and therefore there is no prohibition whatsoever.
Likewise, if there were two adjacent courtyards, and <span class="gemarra-regular">a wife, </span>who owned both courtyards, was standing <span class="gemarra-regular">in the large </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>her husband threw her <span class="gemarra-regular">a bill of divorce </span>into <span class="gemarra-regular">the small </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">she</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is divorced. </span>Her presence in the larger courtyard extends to the smaller one, and she is therefore considered to be standing in the small courtyard. If, however, <span class="gemarra-regular">the wife was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the small </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and the bill of divorce </span>was thrown into <span class="gemarra-regular">the large one, she is not divorced.</span>
Likewise, with regard to communal prayer, if the <span class="gemarra-regular">congregation </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> large </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the prayer leader </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the small</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they fulfill their obligation </span>through his prayer, as the congregation is considered to be in the small one as well. However, if <span class="gemarra-regular">the congregation </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the small</span> courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the prayer leader </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the large one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, they do not fulfill their obligation.</span>
The same principle applies to a prayer quorum: If there were <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span>men <span class="gemarra-regular">in the large </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">small one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they join </span>together to form the necessary quorum of ten, as the small courtyard is subsumed within the large one, and the individual is considered to be in the large courtyard. However, if there were <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span>men <span class="gemarra-regular">in the small </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and one in the large one, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they do not join </span>together. 
Furthermore, if there was <span class="gemarra-regular">excrement in the large </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited to recite </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shema</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the small one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as the excrement is considered to be in the small courtyard as well, and it is prohibited to recite <span class="it-text">Shema</span> in the presence of excrement. If, however, there was <span class="gemarra-regular">excrement</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the small </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted to recite </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shema</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the large one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to them: If so, we have found </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a partition that </span>causes <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> According to these principles, the existence of a partition renders sowing crops prohibited; in the absence of a partition sowing the crops would have been permitted due to their distance from the vines. Ostensibly, this is a counterintuitive conclusion. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, were there no partition </span>at all, it would be sufficient to <span class="gemarra-regular">distance </span>oneself <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits </span>from the vine <span class="gemarra-regular">and sow </span>the crop, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas now </span>that the area is divided into two courtyards by means of a partition, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited </span>to sow the crop in the entire small courtyard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said to Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: And didn’t we find a partition that </span>causes <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? But didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a large courtyard that was breached into a small</span> one, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the large</span> courtyard to carry, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the small one </span>to do so. That is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>in that case, the legal status of the breach <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">the entrance of the large </span>courtyard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if he were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to even its protrusion</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> by constructing partitions in the larger courtyard so that the large courtyard no longer protruded beyond the smaller one, carrying in <span class="gemarra-regular">the large </span>courtyard would <span class="gemarra-regular">also be prohibited, </span>as it would now be completely breached into the smaller courtyard. Apparently, in this case, construction of additional partitions causes prohibition.
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Zeira: The two cases are not comparable, as <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>adding partitions in order to even the protrusions is not considered establishment of partitions. On the contrary, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>effectively <span class="gemarra-regular">the removal of partitions. </span>These partitions are designed to negate the original partitions of the courtyard. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye: And didn’t we find a partition that </span>causes <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition? But wasn’t it stated: </span>

Daf 93a

If one <span class="gemarra-regular">placed roofing on top</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a portico that has doorposts</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a portico with two parallel walls that are valid for a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, as well as posts in the corners supporting the portico and protruding like doorposts, which are considered as sealing the other two sides of the portico, it is a <span class="gemarra-regular">valid </span><span class="it-text">sukka</span>. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he evened the doorpost</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> by constructing walls adjacent to the existing walls, obscuring the posts so that they do not protrude, the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">invalid. </span>This teaching indicates that the creation of a partition can cause prohibition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: In my opinion, </span>with regard to that case of a portico, the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid. </span>However, even <span class="gemarra-regular">according to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your opinion, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>another instance of <span class="gemarra-regular">the removal of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> partitions. </span>Evening the doorposts does not render the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> invalid through the establishment of new partitions, but because it negates the original partitions of the <span class="it-text">sukka</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan said to Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: And didn’t we find </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a partition </span>causes <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a house, half of which is roofe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> half unroofed, </span>if there are <span class="gemarra-regular">vines here, </span>under the roofed section of the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted to sow </span>crops <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the open section. The reason is that it is as though the edge of the roof descends to the ground and forms a partition between the two sections of the house.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if he evened its roofing, </span>by extending the roof to cover the entire house, it would be <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to sow other crops there. It is evident that the very placement of a partition, in this case a roof, causes prohibition. Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: There </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>an instance of <span class="gemarra-regular">the removal of partitions. </span>It is prohibited to sow not due to the added roofing; rather, it is prohibited due to the negation of the imaginary partition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava sent </span>a different proof to <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye by means </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Shemaya bar Ze’eira, </span>with regard to the same issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">And didn’t we find a partition </span>causes <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition? But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">There</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>an element <span class="gemarra-regular">in the partitions of a vineyard </span>that causes <span class="gemarra-regular">leniency </span>with regard to diverse kinds of seeds <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> an element that causes <span class="gemarra-regular">stringency</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> How so? </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a vineyard that is planted until the </span>very <span class="gemarra-regular">base</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a partition, one sows </span>crops <span class="gemarra-regular">from the base of</span> the other side of <span class="gemarra-regular">the partition onward. </span>This is a leniency, <span class="gemarra-regular">as were there no partition there, </span>he would be required to <span class="gemarra-regular">distance </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>from the last vine <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>only then <span class="gemarra-regular">sow </span>there. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is </span>an element in <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions of a vineyard </span>that causes <span class="gemarra-regular">leniency. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for an element in partitions that causes <span class="gemarra-regular">stringency</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, how so? </span>If the vineyard <span class="gemarra-regular">was distanced eleven cubits from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a wall, one may not bring </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds </span>of other crops <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>between the vineyard and the wall, and sow that area. This is a stringency, <span class="gemarra-regular">as were there no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> partition, </span>it would suffice to <span class="gemarra-regular">distance </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>from the last vine, <span class="gemarra-regular">and sow </span>there. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>an element of <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions in a vineyard </span>that causes <span class="gemarra-regular">stringency, </span>a clear situation of a partition that causes prohibition.
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: And according to your reasoning </span>that this presents a difficulty, <span class="gemarra-regular">raise an objection against our </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">from a mishna, </span>rather than a less authoritative <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a clearing in a vineyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Beit Shammai say: </span>Its measure is <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-four cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and Beit Hillel say: Sixteen cubits. </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the perimeter of a vineyard, Beit Shammai say: Sixteen cubits,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Beit Hillel say: Twelve cubits. </span>
The mishna explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a clearing in a vineyard? </span>It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> vineyard whose middle </span>section <span class="gemarra-regular">was laid bare </span>of vines. If <span class="gemarra-regular">there are not sixteen cubits </span>across in the clearing, <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may not bring </span>foreign <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds </span>and sow them <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>due to the Torah prohibition against sowing other crops in a vineyard (Deuteronomy 22:9). If <span class="gemarra-regular">there were sixteen cubits </span>across in the clearing, <span class="gemarra-regular">one provides </span>the vineyard with <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>requisite <span class="gemarra-regular">work</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> area, </span>i.e., four cubits along either side of the vines are left unsown to facilitate cultivation of the vines, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he sows the rest </span>of the cleared area with foreign crops. 
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the perimeter of a vineyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It is the vacant area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the vineyard and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fence </span>surrounding it. If <span class="gemarra-regular">there are not twelve cubits </span>in that area, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not bring </span>foreign <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds </span>and sow them <span class="gemarra-regular">there. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">there are twelve cubits </span>in that area, <span class="gemarra-regular">he provides </span>the vineyard with <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>requisite <span class="gemarra-regular">work area, </span>four cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he sows the rest. </span>However, were the vineyard not surrounded by a fence, all he would need to do is distance himself four cubits from the last vine. It is clear from this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the partition causes prohibition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the objection was not raised from there because <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t this the reason </span>that the partition is not considered to cause prohibition? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the entire </span>area of <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits alongside a vineyard is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">the vineyard’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s work area, </span>and is therefore an actual part of it. Likewise, with regard to the four cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">alongside the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fence </span>surrounding the vineyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">since they cannot </span>easily <span class="gemarra-regular">be sow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> due to the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">he renounces ownership over </span>the area. With regard to the space <span class="gemarra-regular">in between, if it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">significant </span>in its own right, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if not, it is not significant </span>and is nullified relative to the rest, and it is prohibited to sow there. A similar reasoning applies to the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. The stringency is not due to the fact that the partition causes prohibition, but because the partition impedes cultivation of the vineyard. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: </span>If there are <span class="gemarra-regular">three enclosures alongside one another, and the two outer </span>ones <span class="gemarra-regular">protrude, </span>i.e., they are wider than the middle one, so that there are partitions on both sides of the breach between them and the middle enclosure, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> middle one does not protrude, </span>and there are no partitions between it and the outer enclosures, as it is totally breached, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there is one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span>one and yet another person in the third enclosure, the people in the enclosures are considered as though they are all living in one large enclosure. Consequently, the legal status of the group <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a caravan, and one provides them </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the space <span class="gemarra-regular">that they require. </span>In other words, they may use the entire enclosure even if it is very large, just as there are no limits to the size of the enclosed area in which members of a caravan may carry.
However, if the <span class="gemarra-regular">middle </span>enclosure <span class="gemarra-regular">protruded, and the two outer ones did not protrude,</span> i.e., they were narrower than the middle enclosure, so that their entire width was breached into it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there is one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span>one and yet another in the third, <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> provides them only </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in accordance with the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of individuals in a field, who may enclose an area of only two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se</span><span class="it-text">’a</span> per person. As the middle enclosure is larger than the two outer ones, it determines their status, in accordance with the principle stated above, not the other way around. Consequently, the person in the middle enclosure is regarded as though he established residence in only one of the outer enclosures, constituting a group of no more than two, which does not have the legal status of a caravan. 
Based on these assumptions, <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span> person <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>outer enclosure, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one person in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>outer enclosure, <span class="gemarra-regular">and two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle </span>enclosure, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is the ruling that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the pair <span class="gemarra-regular">exit to here, </span>one of the outer enclosures, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are three </span>people in one place, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they exit to there, </span>the other outer enclosure, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> three </span>people in one place, and three people are considered a caravan and provided with all the space they require, as stated above? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">one may exit to her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the other may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exit to there, </span>in which case there would be no more than two people in each enclosure, they are provided with only two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> per person.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may exit to here and one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exit to there, </span>if there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">in this</span> outer enclosure, <span class="gemarra-regular">and two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">in that </span>outer enclosure, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle </span>enclosure, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is the ruling that <span class="gemarra-regular">here, certainly, if he exits</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to here they are three, and if he exits to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there they are </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">three, </span>and consequently they should be provided with all the space they require in any case? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps, </span>in this case too there is uncertainty, as <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>might <span class="gemarra-regular">exit to here, and say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>might <span class="gemarra-regular">exit to there. </span>As the direction in which he will leave his enclosure is undetermined, they should be provided with only two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> each. 
These dilemmas were essentially left unresolved, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">these dilemmas </span>are decided <span class="gemarra-regular">leniently</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span> they are provided with all the space they require in these cases. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span>

Daf 93b

<span class="gemarra-regular">An embankment, </span>a height disparity between two surfaces <span class="gemarra-regular">of five </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">partition of fiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">do not join </span>together to form a partition of ten handbreadths, the minimum height for a partition to enclose a private domain. It is regarded as a partition of ten handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">only if </span>the barrier <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>composed <span class="gemarra-regular">entirely of the embankment or if it is </span>composed <span class="gemarra-regular">entirely </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a partition.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Gemara raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two courtyards, one above the other, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">upper</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one was ten handbreadths higher than the lower one, or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if it had an embankment of five </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">and a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> partition </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>handbreadths, the two courtyards are considered separate domains <span class="gemarra-regular">and they establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one for each courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they do not establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If the height disparity was <span class="gemarra-regular">less than </span>ten handbreadths, the two areas are considered a single domain, and <span class="gemarra-regular">they establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they do not establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: Rav Ḥisda concedes </span>that an embankment and a partition combine <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the lower </span>courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it faces a wall of ten, </span>i.e., there is a full partition of ten handbreadths before its residents. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>according to this reasoning, the residents of the <span class="gemarra-regular">lower </span>courtyard, from whose perspective there is a valid partition, should <span class="gemarra-regular">establish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., an independent <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together with the upper courtyard, while the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the upper </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">establish neither one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">nor two. </span>The residents of the upper courtyard neither establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> on their own, as it is breached into the lower one, nor can they establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> together with the lower courtyard, because the latter is separated from it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Ulla said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">upper </span>courtyard had full-fledged ten-handbreadth-high walls that <span class="gemarra-regular">protruded </span>on both sides of the section of the partition that was merely five handbreadths high, a protrusion that extended <span class="gemarra-regular">up to ten cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In this case, the upper courtyard is properly enclosed by a partition ten handbreadths high, while the section that is only five handbreadths high is deemed an entrance. Consequently, even the residents of the upper courtyard can establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> on their own. But the two courtyards cannot be merged by a single <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, because the lower courtyard is enclosed by a partition from which there is no entrance to the upper courtyard. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, say the latter clause </span>of that same <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If the height disparity was <span class="gemarra-regular">less than </span>ten handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>are considered a single domain, and the residents therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but they do not establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>According to the explanation suggested above, that there is a partition ten handbreadths high between the courtyards with an entrance of sorts between them, <span class="gemarra-regular">if they wish, they establish one</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">if they wish, they establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>That is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case of two courtyards with an entrance between them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, son of Rava, said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> refers to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the lower </span>courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">was fully breached into the upper one, </span>i.e., the gap in the wall spanned the entire width of the lower courtyard. In that case, the residents of the lower courtyard establish a joint <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> with the upper courtyard; however, they may not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> of their own, in accordance with the mishna in which we learned that if a large courtyard is breached into a smaller one, it is permitted for the residents of the large courtyard to carry, but it is prohibited for the residents of the small one to do so.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> should be that the residents of the <span class="gemarra-regular">lower</span> courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together with the upper one, but they <span class="gemarra-regular">do not establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the residents cannot establish an independent <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for their courtyard. However, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the upper one, if </span>its residents <span class="gemarra-regular">wish, </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> together with the lower courtyard, and <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">wish, </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The residents of the upper courtyard can establish an independent <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> for their courtyard, as the larger courtyard renders it prohibited for the residents of the smaller courtyard to carry, but not vice versa. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, it is indeed so; </span>that is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: </span>If the height disparity was <span class="gemarra-regular">less than </span>ten handbreadths, the residents <span class="gemarra-regular">establish one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but they do not establish two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>this statement is not referring to both courtyards, but only <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lower </span>one.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mareimar taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: An embankment of five </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">and an </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">partition of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> five </span>handbreadths above it <span class="gemarra-regular">combine </span>to form a partition of ten handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina met Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Has <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master taught anythin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">partition, </span>whether it is effective or not? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: No. </span>The Gemara concludes: The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">an embankment of five </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">and a partition </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of five </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">combine </span>to form an effective partition of ten handbreadths.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hoshaya raised a dilemma: </span>What is the ruling with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">residents who arrive on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., who join the residents of a courtyard on Shabbat, e.g., if the wall between two courtyards collapsed on Shabbat so that new residents arrive in one courtyard from the other. Had these people arrived before Shabbat they would have rendered it prohibited for the residents to carry in the courtyard unless they participated with the original residents in their <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Do </span>these residents <span class="gemarra-regular">render it prohibited </span>for the original residents to carry in the courtyard, even if they arrive on Shabbat itself?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to the dilemma from the mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a large courtyard that was breached into a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> small </span>courtyard, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> large </span>courtyard to carry, but it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for the residents of <span class="gemarra-regular">the small </span>one to do so. It is permitted to carry in the large courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the breach <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>regarded <span class="gemarra-regular">like the entrance of the large </span>courtyard. Apparently, even if the breach occurred on Shabbat, it is prohibited for the residents of the small courtyard to carry. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: Say </span>that the mishna is dealing with a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">it was breached while it was still day, </span>i.e., on Friday. However, there is no prohibition if the breach occurred on Shabbat itself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: The Master should not state: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Say, </span>indicating that it is possible to explain the mishna in this manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly </span>referring to a case where the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">was breached while it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">still day. As Master, </span>you <span class="gemarra-regular">are the one who said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I raised a dilemma before Rav Huna, and I raised </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a dilemma before Rav Yehuda: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">established an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> to join one courtyard to another <span class="gemarra-regular">via </span>a certain <span class="gemarra-regular">opening, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and that opening was sealed </span>on Shabbat, or if one established an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">via </span>a certain <span class="gemarra-regular">window, and that window </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was sealed </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? May one continue to rely on this <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> and carry from one courtyard to the other via other entrances? <span class="gemarra-regular">And he said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to me: Once </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">was permitted </span>to carry from courtyard to courtyard at the onset of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, it was permitted </span>and remains so until the conclusion of Shabbat. According to this principle, if a breach that adds residents occurs on Shabbat, the breach does not render prohibited activities that were permitted when Shabbat began. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is stated </span>that <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a wall between two courtyards, </span>whose residents did not establish a joint <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">that collapsed </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: One may carry in </span>the joint courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">only</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> within four cubits, </span>as carrying in each courtyard is prohibited due to the other, because they did not establish an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> together. Rav does not accept the principle that an activity that was permitted at the start of Shabbat remains permitted until the conclusion of Shabbat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: </span>

Daf 94a

<span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">may carry to the base of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>former <span class="gemarra-regular">partition, and that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">carry to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the base of the partition, </span>as he maintains that since it was permitted at the beginning of Shabbat, it remains permitted until the conclusion of Shabbat. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav was not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated explicitly; rather, it was stated by inference; </span>i.e., it was inferred by his students from another one of his teachings. As once <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel were sitting in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a certain courtyard </span>on Shabbat, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the wall between </span>the two courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">fell</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shmuel said to </span>the people around him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Take a cloak </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">suspend it on </span>the remnant of the partition. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav turned his face away</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> displaying his displeasure with Shmuel’s opinion, as Rav maintained it was prohibited to carry a cloak in this courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said to them </span>in a humorous vein: <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abba, </span>Rav, <span class="gemarra-regular">is particular, take his bel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">tie </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>to the cloak, to secure it to the partition. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to Shmuel, why was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it necessary </span>to suspend the cloak? He himself <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>If a wall between two courtyards collapsed on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">may carry to the base of the </span>former <span class="gemarra-regular">partition, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">carry to the base of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">partition.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span>did not <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>so to render it permitted to carry in the courtyard. He did so <span class="gemarra-regular">merely </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">privacy, </span>as he did not want the residents of the other courtyard to see into his own courtyard. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if he maintains that </span>in this case carrying is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he should have said </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">to him </span>explicitly. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was Shmuel’s place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rav did not want to disagree with his colleague in his jurisdiction, as he accepted the opinion of the local authority. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>if he accepted the jurisdiction of the local rabbinic authority, <span class="gemarra-regular">why did he turn his face away</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Gemara answers: He acted in this manner so <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> people would <span class="gemarra-regular">not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he retracted his </span>opinion with regard to this <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was breached into the public </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the breach was more than ten cubits wide, so that it cannot be considered an entrance, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who carries </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">into the private domain, or from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">private domain into it, is liable, </span>as it ceases to be a private domain and is subsumed into the public domain. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis </span>disagree and <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>One who carries <span class="gemarra-regular">from inside </span>the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">into the public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the public domain into it, is exempt, because its</span> legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Although it ceases to be a private domain, it does not become a full-fledged public domain.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, due to </span>the fact that the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">was breached into the public domain, </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">it become the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">public domain? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>as in this regard the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Eliezer: </span>In a situation where the <span class="gemarra-regular">multitudes selected a path </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for themselves </span>in a field, or between fields, the path <span class="gemarra-regular">that they selected, they selected, </span>and they retain the right to traverse this path even if the place belongs to an individual. Here too, as the partition of the courtyard was breached to the extent that the public can enter, its status is that of a public domain.
The Gemara expresses surprise at this opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? But didn’t Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Giddel say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: And this </span>applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they had misplaced a path in that field. </span>Generally speaking, the public does not have the right to establish a path wherever it chooses. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case where a public path used to run through that field, but it fell into disuse, and no one remembers its precise course. In this case the public may once again select a path through the field. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say: Here</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> too, </span>the mishna is dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the public <span class="gemarra-regular">misplaced a path in that courtyard. </span>They do not remember the exact position of the partition that once separated the courtyard and the public domain. The public claims that the residents of the courtyard appropriated that part of their domain. It is only this area that Rabbi Eliezer says is considered a public domain. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t Rabbi Ḥanina say: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis is with regard to the entire courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">to [ad] the place of </span>the fallen <span class="gemarra-regular">partition, </span>not only the small section that might have been a public path.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that Rabbi Ḥanina stated that Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree over [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">al</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the place of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">partition, </span>i.e., the dispute does not concern the entire courtyard, but only the former location of the partition, where a public path might once have passed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that the mishna is dealing with a case where the location of the original partition is known, and the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">the sides of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a public domain. As Rabbi Eliezer maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the sides </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a public domain are considered like a public domain,</span> i.e., the areas adjacent to the public domain are subsumed into the public domain. The same applies to the place of the partition that once separated the courtyard and the public domain but was breached. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis maintain</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the sides of a public domain are not considered</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like a public domain.</span>
The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let them disagree with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the sides of a public domain in general; </span>why did they disagree about this particular case? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Had they disagreed with regard to the sides of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">public domain in general, we would have said: When do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer? This </span>dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">applies only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where there are stake</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> alongside the houses, which interfere with the use of the sides of the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">However</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, where there are no </span>such <span class="gemarra-regular">stakes, say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they concede</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him </span>that the sides of a public domain are considered like a public domain. By formulating the dispute with regard to a courtyard that was breached into the public domain, the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us </span>that they disagree in all cases.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> didn’t </span>Rabbi Eliezer <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>with regard to a courtyard that was breached into the public domain, that one who carries an object <span class="gemarra-regular">from inside </span>the courtyard into the private domain is liable? Apparently, he is liable if he carries an article into the private domain from anywhere in the courtyard, not only from the area adjacent to the public domain, as the entire courtyard is considered a public domain.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Rabbis said: From inside </span>the courtyard, Rabbi Eliezer <span class="gemarra-regular">also</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: From inside </span>the courtyard. No conclusion can be inferred from his use of the term, as he was referring only to the section adjacent to the public domain.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But, </span>if that is the case, the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>is difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">the sides of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">public domain </span>is like that of a public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they replied to him </span>by referring to: <span class="gemarra-regular">From inside </span>the entire courtyard? They appear to be addressing two different cases. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what the Rabbis are saying to Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Don’t you concede to us </span>with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he carried </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">from inside </span>the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">to the public domain, or from the public domain to</span> the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, because </span>the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? The sides </span>of the public domain are <span class="gemarra-regular">no different, </span>and should have the status of a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as well.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span>counter this argument? <span class="gemarra-regular">There, the public does not tread on </span>the courtyard; <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">public treads on </span>the edge of the courtyard adjacent to the public domain, and therefore its status is that of a public domain in every sense.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard that was breached </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a public domain from two </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">its sides, and likewise</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a house that was breached from two</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">its sides, and likewise </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whose </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beams or side posts were removed </span>on Shabbat, the residents of that domain <span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted </span>to carry there <span class="gemarra-regular">on that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but are prohibited </span>from doing so <span class="gemarra-regular">in the future. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>This cannot be the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, as <span class="gemarra-regular">if they are permitted</span> to carry there <span class="gemarra-regular">on that Shabbat, they are </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted</span> to do so <span class="gemarra-regular">in the future, and if they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited </span>from carrying there <span class="gemarra-regular">in the future, they are </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from carrying there <span class="gemarra-regular">on that Shabbat.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">With </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">are we dealing? If you say </span>the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the breach was up to <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits wide, in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a breach <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one side </span><span class="gemarra-regular">different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> It is due to the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that we say: It is an entrance </span>rather than a breach, and carrying is therefore permitted. If so, if it was breached <span class="gemarra-regular">on two sides as well, </span>say: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is an entrance, </span>and there are entrances on two sides of the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the mishna is certainly dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a breach that is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than ten </span>cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so, </span>it should be prohibited to carry <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the courtyard was breached <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one side, </span>as a breach that size negates all the partitions. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: Actually, </span>the mishna is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a breach that is no wider than <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits, 

Daf 94b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> breached in a corner, </span>so that it is breached on two sides. Although the opening is no more than ten cubits wide, it cannot be considered an entrance, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> people do not build an entrance in a corner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> It is therefore clear that this is a breach that negates the partition.
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> house that was breached </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">from two of its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> side</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> into a public domain, the residents are permitted to carry in the house on that Shabbat, but not a future Shabbat. The Gemara asks: In <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a breach <span class="gemarra-regular">on one side different? </span>The difference is due to the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that we say: The edge of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">roof descends and seals </span>the house, as if there were a full-fledged partition there. <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, </span>when it is breached <span class="gemarra-regular">on two sides, let us say: The edge of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the roof descends and seals.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>Sages of the <span class="gemarra-regular">school of Rav said in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">name of Rav: </span>The mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the house <span class="gemarra-regular">was breached in a corner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its roofing was inclined</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cannot say: The edge of the roof descends and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seals, </span>as the edge of an inclined roof does not appear to be the beginning of a partition. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: </span>The mishna is referring to a breach that is <span class="gemarra-regular">even wider than ten </span>cubits. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>why did the mishna cite a case where it is breached from two sides? It should be prohibited to carry there <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if it were breached <span class="gemarra-regular">from one side.</span>
The Gemara answers: The reason that it is prohibited only if it is breached from two sides is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a house. </span>In the case of a courtyard, the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> would apply even if it were breached on only one side. However, the mishna sought to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a house as well, in which case, it is prohibited to carry only if it is breached on two sides. If it is breached on one side, the edge of the roof descends and seals, and carrying is permitted. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> house itself should pose a difficulty </span>according to this explanation. In <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a breach <span class="gemarra-regular">on one side different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It is due to the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that we say: The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> edge of the roof descends and seals </span>the house, as if there were a full-fledged partition there. <span class="gemarra-regular">So too</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>when it is breached <span class="gemarra-regular">on two sides, let us say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: The edge of the roof descends and seals.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> furthermore: Is Shmuel of </span>the opinion that there is a principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">The edge of a roof descends and seals? But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wasn’t it stated </span>that there is an amoraic dispute with regard to a portico located <span class="gemarra-regular">in a valley, </span>which has the status of a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to carry in the entire </span>portico, as he maintains that the edge of the roof of the portico descends and seals, rendering it a private domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: One may carry only within four cubits. </span>Apparently, Shmuel does not accept the principle: The edge of a roof descends and seals.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a difficulty. Where </span>Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">is not of </span>the opinion that this principle is applied, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a structure where walls on all <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>sides are formed in that manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, with regard to </span>a structure where only <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>sides are formed in that manner and the fourth side is an actual wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is of </span>the opinion that the principle is applied. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span><span class="gemarra-regular">any case, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. </span>Although the contradiction between the two statements of Shmuel was resolved, the question remains: Why do we not apply the principle: The edge of a roof descends and seals, to two sides of the house? 
The Gemara answers: The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the </span>Sages of the <span class="gemarra-regular">school of Rav said in the name </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav: </span>The mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the house <span class="gemarra-regular">was breached in a corner, and its roofing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was inclined, </span>as in that case, one cannot say: The roof of the house descends and seals. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>Shmuel’s opinion can be explained in a similar manner: The mishna is dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the house <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> breached in a corner, and its roof is </span>at a distance <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths from the breach, and is uneven. In that case, the principle: The edge of a roof descends and seals, would have to be applied to four corners, and Shmuel is of the opinion that it may not be applied in that case. 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel did not say </span>his explanation of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, as </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">does not teach </span>that the roof was <span class="gemarra-regular">slanted, </span>which is the crux of Rav’s explanation. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav did not say </span>his explanation of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so, </span>even if the roof was breached on several sides, <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>legal status would be that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a portico, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a portico, it is permitted to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">carry throughout the entire </span>portico.
The Gemara proceeds to cite the dispute between Rav and Shmuel in a more comprehensive manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was stated </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to carry in the entire </span>portico as it is considered sealed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: One may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">carry only within four cubits. </span>As the portico does not have actual partitions it is subsumed into the field, and shares its status of a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>.
The Gemara elaborates on their respective opinions. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">It is permitted to carry in the entire </span>portico, as he maintains that <span class="gemarra-regular">we say: The edge of the roof </span><span class="gemarra-regular">descends and seals </span>the portico to form a partition. As there is a roof over the portico, it is considered sealed with partitions on all four sides. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One may carry only within four cubits, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">we do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not say: The edge of the ceiling descends and seals</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara elaborates further: If the openings on the sides of the portico are no wider than <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that they are considered sealed, as the status of even an unroofed breach of ten cubits or less is that of an entrance, and one is permitted to carry throughout the entire domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">They disagree </span>only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the openings are <span class="gemarra-regular">more than ten </span>cubits wide.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And some say: </span>On the contrary, if the openings are <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>than ten cubits wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that they are considered breaches, and the principle: The edge of the roof descends and seals, is not applied. <span class="gemarra-regular">They disagree </span>only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the openings are no wider than <span class="gemarra-regular">ten</span> cubits.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And that which Rav Yehuda said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>

Daf 95a

<span class="gemarra-regular">A </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam four </span>handbreadths wide <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">in a ruin </span>that is breached into a public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted, </span>as the edge of the cross beam is considered to descend and seal the breach. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh said: A </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam four </span>handbreadths wide <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">in water permitted </span>like a partition. In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion were these rulings stated?
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this version that you stated, </span>that Rav and Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">agree</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to </span>an opening no wider than <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits, here it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a cross beam that is no longer than <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">and everyone, </span>both Rav and Shmuel, <span class="gemarra-regular">agrees </span>with these rulings. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to that </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">version that you stated, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree with regard to </span>an opening no wider than <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>cubits, these rulings are <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>alone. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Rava are disagreeing with regard to the </span>point that was the subject of a <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute between Rav and Shmuel. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">As it was stated: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">placed roofing on top </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a portic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that has doorposts, </span>i.e., pillars that form the beginnings of partitions, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a valid </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If, however, he placed the roofing atop a portico that <span class="gemarra-regular">has no doorposts, </span>there is a dispute. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: It is a valid </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And Rava said: It is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> invalid. </span>
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: It is valid. </span>As <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">edge of a roof descends and seals. </span>Since the portico is roofed, it is considered to have partitions as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava said: It is invalid, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: The edge of a roof descends and seals. Let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span>holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, and Rava </span>holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel?</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, everyone, </span>including Abaye, <span class="gemarra-regular">agree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that this <span class="it-text">sukka</span> is invalid. <span class="gemarra-regular">Where they disagree </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav. Abaye </span>holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>in a straightforward manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>claims: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav stated </span>his opinion, that the edge of the portico descends and seals, <span class="gemarra-regular">only there, where those partitions</span> formed by the roof <span class="gemarra-regular">were built for the portico</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and they are therefore viewed as sealing it. <span class="gemarra-regular">However here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, where these partitions were not built for </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, no, </span>even Rav would agree that the partitions are not sufficiently significant to utilize for the purpose of this mitzva.
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: If they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted </span>to carry there on that Shabbat, they are likewise permitted to do so in the future, and if they are prohibited from carrying there in the future, they are also prohibited from carrying there on that Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was raised before </span>the Sages: Did <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei </span>intend <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibit </span>carrying even on that Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">or to permit </span>carrying even in the future?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sheshet said: </span>His intention was <span class="gemarra-regular">to prohibit </span>carrying even on that Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>His intention was <span class="gemarra-regular">to prohibit </span>carrying even on that Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">was also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said: Just </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as they are prohibited </span>from carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">in the future, so </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are they prohibited </span>from carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">on that Shabbat. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated: Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥiyya bar Yosef said </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> while Shmuel said </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda.</span>
The Gemara expresses surprise: <span class="gemarra-regular">But did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shmuel </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">are these</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> matters, </span>that an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may be established for a person only with his knowledge, <span class="gemarra-regular">stated? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to a joining of </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries, but with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a joining of courtyards, one may establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> for another person <span class="gemarra-regular">both with his knowledge and without his knowledge, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">because one may act in a person’s interest </span>even when <span class="gemarra-regular">not in his presence, but one may act to </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">disadvantage only in his presence. </span>One may take unilateral action on another’s behalf when it is to that other person’s benefit. However, if it is to that person’s disadvantage, or when the action entails both benefits and disadvantages, he may act on the other person’s behalf only if he was explicitly appointed as his agent. A joining of courtyards is always to a person’s benefit, and therefore it can be established even without his knowledge. However, with regard to a joining of Shabbat boundaries, any distance that a person gains in one direction he forfeits in the opposite direction. Consequently, this type of <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> may be established only with his knowledge. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And furthermore, anyplace where Rabbi Yehuda taught with regard to</span> the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his </span>opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥana of Baghdad said to Rav Yehuda: </span>Did <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel state </span>this ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">even with regard to an alleyway</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whose </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam or side post was removed </span>during Shabbat? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rav Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I spoke to you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to </span>the acquisition of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not with regard to partitions. </span>The Gemara asks: How, then, could Shmuel rule that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda in this case, after explicitly stating that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is not in accordance with his opinion in the case of fallen partitions? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Anan said: </span>This matter <span class="gemarra-regular">was explained to me </span>personally <span class="gemarra-regular">by Shmuel </span>himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>where Shmuel rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, it is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> breached into a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In that case the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is lenient, as there is no concern lest one transgress a Torah prohibition. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>where Shmuel states that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, it is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">was breached</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into a public domain, </span>and the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is therefore stringent, due to the concern lest one transgress a Torah prohibition. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who builds an upper story </span><span class="gemarra-regular">atop two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> on opposite sides of a public domain that passes beneath it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and likewise bridges with a thoroughfare</span> beneath them that rest on walls on opposite sides of a public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">carry beneath </span>the upper story and beneath the bridge <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">statement of Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who maintains that these areas are considered private domains. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis prohibit </span>carrying in these areas. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> even <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an alleyway that is open </span>at both ends, with no need for any additional measures, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis prohibit </span>doing so. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Do not say this is Rabbi Yehuda’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reason</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that he maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law two partitions </span>constitute a private domain, i.e., the areas beneath the upper story and the bridge are considered private domains, as each has two partitions, one on each side of the public domain. Rather, the reason for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion is <span class="gemarra-regular">because he maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the edge of a roof </span><span class="gemarra-regular">descends and seals. </span>The edges of the upper story and the bridge are considered to seal the areas beneath them. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">objection to </span>Rabba from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who has two houses on two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sides of a public domain </span>and seeks to carry from one house to the other on Shabbat via the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">he places a side post from here, </span>adjacent to one of the houses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">side post from there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>adjacent to the other house, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>he places <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam from here and </span>another cross <span class="gemarra-regular">beam from there, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he may </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">carry </span>objects <span class="gemarra-regular">and place </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> middle </span>of the area, as he transformed it into a private domain. His colleagues <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: One cannot </span><span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> to transform a <span class="gemarra-regular">public domain </span>into a private domain <span class="gemarra-regular">in this manner. </span>Clearly, the rationale for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion in that case is not that the edge of the roof descends and seals, as the area is not covered. Rather, he apparently holds that by Torah law, two walls suffice to form a private domain. 
Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>it is indeed possible to arrive at this conclusion. But <span class="gemarra-regular">from this, </span>the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing can </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be learned from this </span>source, as there could be a different reason for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ashi said: The mishna is also precise </span>in its wording, as it indicates that the rationale for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion is that the edge of a roof descends and seals. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">establish an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> even <span class="gemarra-regular">for an alleyway that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is open </span>at both ends, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis prohibit </span>doing so. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the reason for Rabbi Yehuda’s leniency with regard to carrying beneath an upper story and a bridge is <span class="gemarra-regular">that he maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the edge of a roof </span><span class="gemarra-regular">descends and seals, that is </span>why the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">states: And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">furthermore, </span>to introduce the ruling for an alleyway. In other words, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of our mishna is saying that the ruling applies not only to a roofed area, but also to an unroofed alleyway, despite the fact that the reason there is that two partitions suffice to create a private domain by Torah law. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you say </span>that Rabbi Yehuda permitted the first case as well <span class="gemarra-regular">because he maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law two partitions</span> suffice to create a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the need for the introduction: <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore? </span>The rationale for the second ruling is no different from the rationale for the first. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from here </span>that this is correct. 

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who finds phylacterie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> outside the city on Shabbat, where they are in danger of becoming lost or damaged, <span class="gemarra-regular">brings them in </span>to his house <span class="gemarra-regular">pair </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">pair </span>by donning them in the manner in which they are typically donned for the mitzva. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel says: </span>He brings them in <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>pairs by <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>pairs. <span class="gemarra-regular">In what</span> case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement </span>that one is permitted to carry phylacteries inside <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to old </span>phylacteries, which have already been used and are designated for the mitzva. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, with regard to new </span>ones, as it is unclear whether they are phylacteries or merely amulets in the form of phylacteries, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from performing the task.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">one finds</span> phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">tied in bundles or in wrapped piles, </span>in which case he is unable to carry them in pairs, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span> sits there and <span class="gemarra-regular">waits with them until dark</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> guarding them until the conclusion of Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">brings them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>to his house. 

Daf 95b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And in </span>a time of <span class="gemarra-regular">danger, </span>when it is dangerous to tarry outside town, <span class="gemarra-regular">he covers </span>the phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">and proceeds on his </span>way. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says </span>that there is an alternative method of transferring the phylacteries: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gives them to another </span>who is less than four cubits from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the other </span>passes them <span class="gemarra-regular">to another, until </span>the phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">reach the outermost courtyard </span>of the city. Since carrying less than four cubits in a public domain is not prohibited by Torah law, in this case, the Sages permitted carrying in that manner due to the sanctity of the phylacteries.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s son </span>who was born in a field and may not be carried on Shabbat, since that is akin to carrying a burden in the public domain: <span class="gemarra-regular">One gives him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to another, and the other </span>passes him <span class="gemarra-regular">to another, even </span>if it requires <span class="gemarra-regular">a hundred </span>people. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">person </span>may even <span class="gemarra-regular">give a barrel to another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>may pass it <span class="gemarra-regular">to another, </span>and in that way <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>take it <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, </span>provided that no one person carries it more than four cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: This </span>barrel may <span class="gemarra-regular">not go a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">greater </span>distance <span class="gemarra-regular">than the feet of its owner, </span>i.e., it may not be carried any farther than its owner may walk.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna that a person who finds phylacteries in a field may carry them by pairs, indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">one pair, yes, </span>it may be carried; however, <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>than one pair, <span class="gemarra-regular">no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>they may not be carried. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned the unattributed </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">not in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> despite the principle that an unattributed mishna usually reflects Rabbi Meir’s opinion. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">As, if </span>you say that the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, didn’t </span>Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>In order to rescue items from a fire, one is permitted to remove items from his house by wearing them, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he dons all </span>the clothes <span class="gemarra-regular">that he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">can wear, and wraps </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">in all </span>items in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he can wrap </span>himself. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one removes all the utensils to </span>the courtyard adjacent to the fire, <span class="gemarra-regular">and dons all </span>the garments <span class="gemarra-regular">that he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> can wear, and wraps </span>himself in <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the items in <span class="gemarra-regular">which he can wrap </span>himself in order to rescue his property. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from where </span>do we know that <span class="gemarra-regular">this unattributed </span>mishna with regard to Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a reflection of the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir? As it teaches with regard to </span>that mishna: If there are many garments there, one <span class="gemarra-regular">dons </span>a garment, and <span class="gemarra-regular">takes </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">out </span>to a safe place, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">removes </span>it there, <span class="gemarra-regular">and returns </span>to the fire, <span class="gemarra-regular">and dons </span>another garment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and takes </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">out and removes </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>he may do so <span class="gemarra-regular">even all day long; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. </span>Apparently, according to Rabbi Meir, one may don only one garment at a time.
In answer to the question, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Even if you say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>there is a distinction between the cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>if he dons the clothes in <span class="gemarra-regular">the manner that he </span>typically <span class="gemarra-regular">wears them, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sages rendered </span>the legal status of wearing garments on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the status of wearing garments during the <span class="gemarra-regular">week </span>and permitted him to remove clothes from his house by wearing them in that manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">And here, </span>too, if he dons phylacteries in <span class="gemarra-regular">the manner that he </span>typically <span class="gemarra-regular">dons them, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sages rendered </span>the legal status of donning phylacteries on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the status of donning phylacteries during the <span class="gemarra-regular">week.</span>
Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">there, where during the week he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">wear as many </span>clothes <span class="gemarra-regular">as he wishes, with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rescue </span>from a fire <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages likewise permitted him </span>to wear as many clothes as he wishes. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of phylacteries, <span class="gemarra-regular">even during the week, </span>donning <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pair, yes, </span>one may do so, but donning <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>than one pair, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>he may not do so. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to rescue as well, </span>the Sages said: Donning <span class="gemarra-regular">one pair, yes, </span>one may do so; however, donning <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span>than one pair, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>he may not.
We learned in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>He brings the phylacteries in <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>pairs <span class="gemarra-regular">by two</span> pairs. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What does he hold? </span>What is the rationale for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">If he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a time for phylacteries, </span>and one is permitted or even obligated to don phylacteries on Shabbat, then the ruling should be: Donning <span class="gemarra-regular">one pair, yes, </span>this is permitted; donning <span class="gemarra-regular">more, no, </span>it is prohibited. It should be prohibited to wear more than one pair as there is room to don only one set of phylacteries on one’s head. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat is not a time for phylacteries, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it was only <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">rescue </span>was permitted only in the <span class="gemarra-regular">manner </span>that one typically wears <span class="gemarra-regular">clothing </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages permitted him </span>to don phylacteries, he should <span class="gemarra-regular">likewise </span>be permitted to don <span class="gemarra-regular">even more </span>than two pairs. He should be permitted to don as many pairs of phylacteries as possible, not only two.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat is not a time for phylacteries, and when the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sages permitted </span>one to don phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">for the purpose of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rescue, </span>it was only by donning them in the <span class="gemarra-regular">manner</span> that one typically wears <span class="gemarra-regular">clothing, </span>i.e., in the appropriate <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries. </span>He may not don them anywhere else on his body, as in that case he is considered to be carrying, not wearing them. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">one pair, yes, </span>it should be permitted, but <span class="gemarra-regular">more, no, </span>it should not be permitted, as the second pair is necessarily positioned out of place. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Rav Yitzḥak said: There is room on </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to place two phylacteries. </span>One can place two phylacteries on his head and don them both in the proper manner.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">It works out well </span>with regard to donning two phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">of the head, </span>as there is room; however, with regard to the phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">of the arm, what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is there to say? </span>How can one wear two phylacteries on his arm simultaneously?
The Gemara answers that even when one dons two phylacteries on his arm, he is regarded as donning them in the typical manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna. As Rav Huna </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Sometimes a person comes from the field with his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bundle on his head, </span>and in order not to crush the phylacteries, he <span class="gemarra-regular">removes them from his head and binds </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them on his arm. </span>This indicates that there is room for additional phylacteries on his arm. 
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say that Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Huna said </span>that one may remove the phylacteries from his head and tie them on his arm <span class="gemarra-regular">so that he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will not </span>come to <span class="gemarra-regular">treat </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in a degrading manner </span>by placing a bundle on top of them. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he say </span>that the spot on his arm is <span class="gemarra-regular">fit </span>for two phylacteries? Can proof be cited from here that one may don additional phylacteries on his arm <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel bar Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yitzḥak said: There is room on </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">head to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place two phylacteries. Here, too, there is room on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">arm to place two phylacteries.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Menashe taught </span>the following. The verse states: “And you shall bind them for a sign on your arm, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">“On your arm,” this is the biceps </span>muscle of the arm; <span class="gemarra-regular">“between your eyes,” this is the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> crown </span>of the head. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where </span>exactly on the crown of the head? <span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yannai say: </span>Phylacteries are placed on <span class="gemarra-regular">the spot where a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">baby’s head is soft </span>after birth.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree about </span>the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak, </span>such <span class="gemarra-regular">that the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span>of the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak </span>that there is room on one’s head for two phylacteries, <span class="gemarra-regular">while Rabban Gamliel is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak, </span>and therefore one is permitted to bring in two pairs of phylacteries at a time.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, everyone is </span>of the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel bar Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yitzḥak, and here they disagree with regard to </span>whether or not <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat is a time for phylacteries</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> The first</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat is a time for phylacteries. </span>Although one may don one pair of phylacteries, he may not add to the mitzva by donning an extra pair. If he does so, it is tantamount to carrying a prohibited burden.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabban </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gamliel holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat is not a time for phylacteries.</span> Consequently, one may don more than one pair, as the day itself is not at all suitable for donning phylacteries. When he dons the second pair, he is not adding to the mitzva. With regard to rescuing them, the phylacteries have the legal status of an ornament that he is permitted to don, provided that he dons no more than two pairs. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that the dispute should be understood as follows. <span class="gemarra-regular">Everyone agrees that Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a time for phylacteries, and here they disagree </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>whether or not fulfillment of <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot requires </span><span class="gemarra-regular">intent. The first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds: To fulfill </span>a mitzva one <span class="gemarra-regular">needs intent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, if one dons phylacteries without intent to fulfill the mitzva, no mitzva is performed, and he is merely carrying a burden. However, if he has intent to fulfill the mitzva, he may don no more than one pair. If he does so, he violates the prohibition against adding to mitzvot. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabban Gamliel holds: </span>In order to fulfill a mitzva, <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not need </span><span class="gemarra-regular">intent. </span>Therefore, if one dons two pairs of phylacteries he fulfills his obligation with one of them, but does not violate the prohibition against adding to mitzvot with the other. In order to do so, he would require specific intent to fulfill a second mitzva with the additional pair. 

Daf 96a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">to fulfill </span>a mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">need intent, and here they disagree with regard to </span>the condition needed <span class="gemarra-regular">to violate </span>the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not add </span>to mitzvot of the Torah. <span class="gemarra-regular">As the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not need intent to violate </span>the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not add </span>to mitzvot. One who dons another pair of phylacteries transgresses the prohibition against adding to mitzvot even if he does not don them with the intention of fulfilling the mitzva. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabban Gamliel holds </span>that in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to violate </span>the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not add </span>to mitzvot, <span class="gemarra-regular">one needs intent </span>to perform a mitzva. Since in this case one’s intention is merely to move the phylacteries to a safer place, he may don a second pair. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that the dispute may be explained as follows. <span class="gemarra-regular">If we were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to maintain </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat is </span>a fit <span class="gemarra-regular">time for </span>donning <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries, everyone </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">agree </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not need intent</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to violate </span>the prohibition against adding to mitzvot, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one need intent to fulfill </span>a mitzva. In this case, one’s intention has no bearing on his action.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, here, they disagree with regard to </span>the condition for <span class="gemarra-regular">violating </span>the prohibition against adding to a mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in its </span>proper <span class="gemarra-regular">time, </span>i.e., when a mitzva is performed not at its prescribed time. <span class="gemarra-regular">The first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds</span> that if the act of a mitzva is performed not in its proper time, <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not need intent; </span>that is, even if one does not intend to perform the mitzva he nonetheless violates the prohibition against adding to mitzvot by his action alone. Consequently, in this case, a person may not don more than one pair of phylacteries. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabban Gamliel holds that to violate </span>the prohibition against adding to a mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">not in its </span>proper <span class="gemarra-regular">time, one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">needs intent </span>to fulfill the mitzva. Without such intent one does not violate the prohibition, and therefore in this case he may don a second pair of phylacteries.
With regard to this last explanation the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir </span>one should <span class="gemarra-regular">not even </span>don <span class="gemarra-regular">one pair </span>of phylacteries. According to Rabbi Meir’s opinion, one who does so violates the prohibition against adding to mitzvot merely by donning one pair, since he is fulfilling the mitzva of phylacteries at a time when he is not commanded to do so. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">furthermore, </span>according to this opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sleeps in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the Eighth Day </span>of Assembly <span class="gemarra-regular">should be flogged</span> for violating the prohibition against adding to mitzvot, as he adds to the mitzva of: “You shall dwell in booths for seven days” (Leviticus 23:42). Yet the Sages instituted that outside of Eretz Yisrael, Jews must observe <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> for eight days, even though one who sleeps in a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> on the eighth night outside of Eretz Yisrael transgresses a Torah law. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, it is clear as we originally answered, </span>i.e., you must accept one of the other explanations.
Since the topic of phylacteries was discussed, the Gemara continues to explore this issue.  <span class="gemarra-regular">Whom did you hear </span>who said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a fit <span class="gemarra-regular">time for </span>donning <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the end of the section in the Torah beginning with: “Sanctify all firstborns to me” (Exodus 13:2), which deals with the mitzvot of the Paschal lamb and phylacteries: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And you shall observe this ordinance in its season from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">year [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">miyamim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to year” </span>(Exodus 13:10), which indicates that these mitzvot apply during the <span class="gemarra-regular">days </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">yamim</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">and not </span>during the <span class="gemarra-regular">nights. </span>Furthermore, the letter <span class="it-text">mem</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">“from year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">miyamim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">But not </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">all days; </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat and Festivals, </span>on which phylacteries are not worn. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says: This ordinance is stated only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the Paschal </span>lamb, and it does not refer to phylacteries at all. According to Rabbi Akiva, there is no reason to refrain from donning phylacteries on Shabbat and Festivals.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Paschal </span>lamb<span class="gemarra-regular"> and circumcisio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are positive mitzvot, let us say that</span> this statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva. </span>The reason for this claim is <span class="gemarra-regular">that if</span> you say this teaching is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, since he establishes </span>this verse as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Paschal </span>lamb, this would mean that in failure to bring this offering there <span class="gemarra-regular">is also </span>the violation of <span class="gemarra-regular">a negative </span>mitzva, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the principle <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Avin </span>said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elai said. As Rabbi Avin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elai said: Any place </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: Observe, lest, or do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> this means <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> other than a negative </span>mitzva, as these are negative terms. Consequently, the verse “You shall observe this ordinance,” which refers to the Paschal lamb, constitutes a negative mitzva.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even if you say</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva </span>holds that no negative mitzva applies to the Paschal lamb, it is not difficult, as an additional principle must be taken into account. Although it is true that the term <span class="gemarra-regular">observe with regard to a negative </span>mitzva indicates the presence of another <span class="gemarra-regular">negative </span>mitzva; that same term <span class="gemarra-regular">observe </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a positive </span>mitzva has the force of <span class="gemarra-regular">a positive </span>mitzva, as the Torah is warning adherents to take special care in the observance of a mitzva. The word observe in connection with the Paschal lamb is an example of this type of positive mitzva.
The Gemara returns to the issue at hand: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">hold that Shabbat is a time for </span>donning <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>I <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person should don </span><span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries on </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Festivals</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And it shall be for a sign for you on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your arm, </span>and for a remembrance between your eyes, so that God’s law shall be in your mouth; for with a strong arm God brought you out of Egypt” (Exodus 13:9). The obligation to don phylacteries applies when Jews <span class="gemarra-regular">require a sign </span>to assert their Judaism and their status as the Chosen People, i.e., during the week, <span class="gemarra-regular">excluding </span>Shabbat and Festivals, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they are themselves sign</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of Israel’s status as the Chosen People and a remembrance of the exodus from Egypt. Consequently, no further sign is required on these days. This teaching proves that Rabbi Akiva maintains that Shabbat is not a fit time for donning phylacteries.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>Rabbi Natan, who maintains that Shabbat is not a fit time for donning phylacteries, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is awake</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at night, if he wishes he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">remove </span>his phylacteries, and <span class="gemarra-regular">if he wishes he </span>may continue to <span class="gemarra-regular">don </span>them, and he need not worry about violating the prohibition against adding to mitzvot. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Natan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Yonatan HaKiton</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not don phylacteries at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">night. From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that according to the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Rabbi Natan, <span class="gemarra-regular">night is </span>a fit <span class="gemarra-regular">time for phylacteries, </span>it may be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, too, is a time for</span> donning <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries, </span>as Rabbi Natan evidently does not accept Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s limitation based on the phrase: From year to year.
The Gemara rejects this contention: This is not a conclusive proof, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he holds </span>that although <span class="gemarra-regular">night is </span>a fit <span class="gemarra-regular">time</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for phylacteries, Shabbat is not </span>a fit <span class="gemarra-regular">time for phylacteries</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. As we </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">heard that Rabbi Akiva said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">night is a time for phylacteries</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> because he does not accept the limitation of “from days to days,” and yet he maintains that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat is not a time for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries, </span>as no sign is required on Shabbat. It is therefore possible that Rabbi Natan holds the same opinion. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>we must say that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> who maintains that Shabbat is a time for phylacteries, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Michal, daughter of Kushi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> King Saul, <span class="gemarra-regular">would don phylacteries, and the Sages did not protest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> against her </span>behavior, as she was permitted to do so. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Jonah’s wif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would undertake the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Festival pilgrimage and the Sages did not protest against her </span>practice. <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Sages did not protest </span><span class="gemarra-regular">against </span>Michal’s donning phylacteries, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is apparent that these</span> Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">hold </span>that phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">is a positive mitzva not bound</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by time</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., it is a mitzva whose performance is mandated at all times, including nights and Shabbat. There is an accepted principle that women are obligated in all positive mitzvot not bound by time.
The Gemara rejects this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps </span>that <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>

Daf 96b

<span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, who said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">optional </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">women </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>their hands on the head of a sacrificial animal before it is slaughtered. Although only men have this obligation, women may perform that rite if they wish. Similarly, women may perform other mitzvot that they have no obligation to fulfill. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">As, if you do not say so, </span>that this <span class="it-text">tanna</span> holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that <span class="gemarra-regular">Jonah’s wife would ascend </span>to Jerusalem for <span class="gemarra-regular">the Festival pilgrimage and </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">did not reprimand</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> her. Is there anyone who says </span>that the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival </span>pilgrimage <span class="gemarra-regular">is not a time-bound positive mitzva </span>and that women are obligated to fulfill it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that she did not embark on the pilgrimage as an obligation, but that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">optional; here, too, </span>with regard to phylacteries, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">optional. </span>Consequently, no proof can be cited from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as to whether or not Shabbat is a fit time for phylacteries. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>who is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who maintains that Shabbat is a time for phylacteries? <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> who taught the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who finds phylacteries brings them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in pair </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">pair, whether </span>the finder is <span class="gemarra-regular">a man</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or whether </span>she is <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the phylacteries are <span class="gemarra-regular">new or whether </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">old. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda prohibits </span>bringing in <span class="gemarra-regular">new</span> phylacteries since they might merely be amulets in the form of phylacteries, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">permits </span>bringing in <span class="gemarra-regular">old </span>ones, which are certainly valid phylacteries.
Analysis of this <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> indicates that Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree only with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">new </span>phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">and old ones; however, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a woman </span>bringing in the phylacteries, <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do not disagree </span>that it is permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from it</span> that this <span class="it-text">tanna</span> maintains that donning phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">is a positive</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mitzva not bound by time, and </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">women are obligated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in every positive mitzva not bound by time, </span>a woman may don these phylacteries and walk into the town.
The Gemara attempts to refute this. <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps </span>that <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, who said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">optional </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">women</span> to <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>their hands on the head of a sacrificial animal before it is slaughtered. Here too, perhaps it is optional for women to don phylacteries. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This cannot enter your mind, as neither Rabbi Meir holds</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, nor does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehuda hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosei, </span>as the Gemara proceeds to prove.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Neither Rabbi Meir holds in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance </span>with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, as we learned</span> in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">not prevent children from soundin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> the <span class="it-text">shofar</span> on Rosh HaShana. Although there is an element of prohibition in sounding the <span class="it-text">shofar</span> when there is no obligation to do so, since the children will one day be obligated to sound the <span class="it-text">shofar</span>, one need not prevent them from doing so and learning. It may be inferred from here that <span class="gemarra-regular">one must prevent women </span>from sounding the <span class="it-text">shofar</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And an unattributed mishna </span>is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>indicating that according to Rabbi Meir, a woman does not even have the option of performing a time-bound positive mitzva. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Nor does Rabbi Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Sifra</span>, the halakhic <span class="it-text">midrash</span> on Leviticus. The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Speak to the sons of Israel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">…and he shall place </span>his hands on the head of the burnt-offering” (Leviticus 1:2–4). By inference, <span class="gemarra-regular">the sons of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Israel place </span>their hands, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the daughters of Israel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do not place </span>their hands. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon say: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">optional </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">women </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>their hands on the head of a sacrificial animal before it is slaughtered.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And who is </span>the author of <span class="gemarra-regular">an unattributed </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Sifra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This teaching proves that Rabbi Yehuda maintains that women do not have the option of placing their hands on a sacrifice. Neither Rabbi Meir nor Rabbi Yehuda accepts Rabbi Yosei’s opinion that it is optional for women to perform time-bound positive mitzvot; therefore, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who cited their opinions that a woman may bring in phylacteries on Shabbat maintains that the mitzva of phylacteries is not time-bound and is in effect even on Shabbat, which is why even women are obligated. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who one finds </span>fabric dyed <span class="gemarra-regular">sky blu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the marketplace</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if he found <span class="gemarra-regular">strips </span>of combed and dyed wool <span class="gemarra-regular">they are unfit </span>for use as ritual fringes. The sky blue threads used in ritual fringes must be spun and dyed for the purpose of the mitzva, and these strips might have been dyed for a different purpose. However, if one found sky blue <span class="gemarra-regular">threads, they are fit </span>for use in ritual fringes, as it can be assumed they were prepared for that purpose.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">strips </span>that renders them unfit? It is because Rabbi Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">said: One dyed </span>the strips <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the intent </span>to use them <span class="gemarra-regular">for a cloak. </span>If so, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">threads as well, let us say: One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">spun them with the intent </span>to use them <span class="gemarra-regular">for a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cloak. </span>In that case, they too would be deemed unfit. The Gemara answers: Here, it is referring to threads that are <span class="gemarra-regular">twisted, </span>which are not typically used for weaving. 
The Gemara asks: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">twisted </span>threads <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one twisted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them with the intent </span>of attaching them to <span class="gemarra-regular">the hem </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a cloak </span>as ornamentation. The Gemara answers: It is referring to twisted threads <span class="gemarra-regular">that were cut </span>into short strings suitable for use as ritual fringes, <span class="gemarra-regular">as people certainly do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not exert </span>themselves and fashion fringes of a cloak to resemble ritual fringes.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The assertion that people do not exert themselves is problematic, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>by the same token, <span class="gemarra-regular">does a person exert </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">to fashion an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> amulet in the form of phylacteries? </span>Nevertheless, the Sages were concerned that an object that appears to be phylacteries might actually be a different object. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement </span>that one is permitted to carry phylacteries inside on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to old </span>phylacteries. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to new </span>ones, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is exempt </span>from the obligation to bring them in, as it is possible that they are not phylacteries but amulets in the form of phylacteries. Similarly, there should be concern lest people fashion items similar to objects used for a mitzva, even if exertion is involved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said to his son Ahava: Go out</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and teach </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the Sages. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who finds </span>fabric dyed <span class="gemarra-regular">sky blue in the marketplace</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>if he finds <span class="gemarra-regular">strips, they are unfit </span>for use in ritual fringes; however, if he finds <span class="gemarra-regular">threads cut </span>into short strings, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are fit </span>for use in ritual fringes <span class="gemarra-regular">because a person does not exert </span>himself. Apparently, that is the reason for the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">because Ahava, son of Rabbi Zeira, taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he hung </span>ornamental <span class="gemarra-regular">rings on </span>that line of reasoning, i.e., does that constitute an absolute proof? The difficulty posed by Rava from the mishna is not resolved by the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">statement </span>that one is permitted to carry phylacteries inside <span class="gemarra-regular">said?</span> It is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to old </span>phylacteries. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to new </span>ones, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is exempt. </span>Apparently, there is concern lest one exert himself to fashion an object similar to one used in a mitzva.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Rava said: </span>The sources are not contradictory, as the question of whether one <span class="gemarra-regular">exerts </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">or does not exert </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the subject of a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Some hold that one exerts himself as indicated by the mishna with regard to phylacteries, whereas others hold that one does not exert himself as stated with regard to sky blue dye.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who finds phylacteries </span>in a field <span class="gemarra-regular">brings them in </span>to the town <span class="gemarra-regular">pair </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">pair, whether </span>the finder is <span class="gemarra-regular">a man or a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woman, </span>

Daf 97a

and <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the phylacteries are <span class="gemarra-regular">new or old; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda prohibits </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">new </span>phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">but permits </span>carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">old </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ones</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Apparently, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">person exerts </span>himself to fashion an amulet that looks like phylacteries, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Meir, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not exert </span>himself for this purpose, and therefore something that has the appearance of phylacteries must be phylacteries.
<span class="gemarra-italic">Shin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yod</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzadi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yod</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ayin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzadi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yod</span> is a <span class="gemarra-regular">mnemonic </span>for the statements that follow. The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And now that the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> father of Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak has taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">these</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are </span>deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">old </span>phylacteries: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any that have straps that </span>are permanently <span class="gemarra-regular">tie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in the manner of phylacteries, and <span class="gemarra-regular">new </span>phylacteries are those <span class="gemarra-regular">that have straps that are not tied, </span>the conclusion is <span class="gemarra-regular">that everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person exerts </span>himself to fashion an amulet similar to phylacteries or string-like ritual fringes. They disagree with regard to new phylacteries that are not tied properly and cannot be donned in a manner typical of a weekday. The reason is that tying a permanent knot on Shabbat is prohibited by Torah law. Therefore, these phylacteries may not be donned, and Rabbi Zeira’s opinion is accepted. 
The Gemara asks a question with regard to Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion that new phylacteries may not be brought into town because they lack a permanent knot: Why must one tie the phylacteries with a knot? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him </span>simply <span class="gemarra-regular">tie a bow, </span>which is not prohibited on Shabbat, and place the phylacteries on his head and arm in that manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: That is to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a bow is invalid for phylacteries, </span>as a proper knot is required. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>This is not the correct interpretation. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>conforms to <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as he said: A bow is a full-fledged</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> knot, </span>and it is prohibited to tie it on Shabbat by Torah law. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>that it is prohibited to tie a bow is <span class="gemarra-regular">that a bow is a full-fledged</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> knot. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">that were not so, </span>one could <span class="gemarra-regular">tie </span>the phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">with a bow. But didn’t Rav Yehuda, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, say in the name </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav: </span>The form of the permanent <span class="gemarra-regular">knot of phylacterie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> transmitted to Moses from Sinai; and Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman said: And their decorative </span>side, the side of the knot where the shape of the letter appears, must face <span class="gemarra-regular">outward</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Apparently, a bow does not suffice for phylacteries, as an actual knot is required.
The Gemara rejects this contention: It is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one tied a bow similar </span>in form <span class="gemarra-regular">to a </span>permanent <span class="gemarra-regular">knot, </span>without actually tying a permanent knot.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: One who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">purchases </span>a large quantity of <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries from one who is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not an expert, </span>i.e., a person who has not proven to be a reliable manufacturer of phylacteries, the purchaser <span class="gemarra-regular">examines two </span>phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">of the arm and one of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">head, or two of the head and one of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">arm, </span>to see if they are valid and the individual reliable. If the three phylacteries are found to be valid upon examination, the seller is considered an expert and the rest of the phylacteries are presumed valid as well. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whichever way you look at it, </span>this ruling is problematic: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">purchased </span>all of the phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one person, </span>who acquired them from somebody else, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">examine three </span>phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">of the arm or three of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">head, </span>in accordance with the principle that presumptive status is established after three instances. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">If he purchased </span>the phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">from two </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">three people, each and every one </span>of the phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">require examination</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The presumptive status of one pair of phylacteries does not apply to the others, as they might have been produced by a different person. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>this refers to a case where the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">bought </span>the phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">from one person, and we require </span>that the seller prove himself <span class="gemarra-regular">to be an expert with regard to </span>both the phylactery <span class="gemarra-regular">of the arm and </span>the phylactery <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the head.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that so? Didn’t Rabba bar Shmuel teach </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries one examines three of the arm and </span>three <span class="gemarra-regular">of the head? What, is it not </span>that he examines <span class="gemarra-regular">either three </span>phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">of the arm or three of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the head? </span>The Gemara rejects this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it means that he examines <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>phylacteries in total, <span class="gemarra-regular">among them </span>phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">of the arm and among them </span>phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">of the head, </span>as stated by Rav Ḥisda in the name of Rav. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rav Kahana </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries one examines two of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the arm and </span>two <span class="gemarra-regular">of the head? </span>This statement certainly contradicts Rav’s opinion. The Gemara explains: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">who said: Presumptive status is </span>established <span class="gemarra-regular">by two times. </span>Although most Sages maintain that it takes three instances to establish a presumptive status, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi rules that two cases suffice. Consequently, in the case of phylacteries, it is sufficient to examine two.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>this ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">say the latter clause </span>of that same <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>he must <span class="gemarra-regular">likewise </span>examine <span class="gemarra-regular">the second</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bundle </span>of phylacteries, <span class="gemarra-regular">and likewise the third bundle. And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if it is </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">is he of </span>the opinion that <span class="gemarra-regular">a third </span>examination is necessary? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi does not require a third examination to establish a presumptive status, as he maintains that the examination of two bundles suffices.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to bundles, as one buys </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">from two </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">people. </span>It can be assumed that the various bundles of phylacteries were not all manufactured by the same person. Consequently, the validity of one bundle does not establish a presumption with regard to another. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so, even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourth </span>bundle must be examined <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fifth as well. </span>If the bundles were bought from different manufacturers, every one of them requires examination, not only the third. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is indeed so; </span>this is how one must proceed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches three </span>bundles rather than four or five is <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the third bundle <span class="gemarra-regular">from its presumptive status. </span>By stating that the third bundle must be examined, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi indicates that in this case two examinations do not establish a presumption; rather, all of the bundles must be checked. <span class="gemarra-regular">And actually, even</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourth and fifth </span>bundles require examination <span class="gemarra-regular">as well. </span>
It was stated in the mishna that if <span class="gemarra-regular">one finds </span>phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">tied in bundles or in wrapped piles, </span>he sits there and waits with them until dark and then brings them in. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">bundles</span> in this context, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is </span>meant by <span class="gemarra-regular">wrapped piles</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>The same types of objects <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>called <span class="gemarra-regular">bundles, and they are </span>also called <span class="gemarra-regular">wrapped</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> piles, </span>i.e., both contain more than one pair of phylacteries. <span class="gemarra-regular">Bundles </span>consist of many pairs of phylacteries arranged <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pairs [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zuvei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of a head phylactery with an arm phylactery, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">wrapped pile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">that many </span>phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wrapped together </span>in no particular arrangement.
We learned in the mishna that one sits there and <span class="gemarra-regular">waits with them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until dark and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">brings them </span>in. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why </span>must he do that? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him bring them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in pair </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">pair. Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, said: </span>This matter <span class="gemarra-regular">was explained to me </span>personally <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any </span>instance where there are few enough phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">that were he to bring them in pair</span> by <span class="gemarra-regular">pai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he would finish before sunset, he brings </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">pair </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">pair. But if not, </span>i.e., if there are so many pairs of phylacteries that were he to bring them in one pair at a time he would not bring them all in before sunset, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">waits </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>all of <span class="gemarra-regular">them until dark and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">brings them </span>in.
It was stated in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a time of <span class="gemarra-regular">dange</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one covers </span>the phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">and proceeds </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on his </span>way. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught</span> in a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And in </span>a time of <span class="gemarra-regular">danger he carries them less than four cubits </span>at a time? The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>mishna, which states that the finder covers the phylacteries, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the danger </span>posed <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gentiles, </span>where the gentile authorities decreed against donning phylacteries and the finder is afraid to be seen carrying them. However, in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which teaches that one may carry them less than four cubits at a time, it is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with the danger </span>posed <span class="gemarra-regular">by bandits [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">listim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In that case he is afraid to remain there until dark, but he is not worried about taking the phylacteries with him. Consequently, he may carry them less than four cubits at a time. 

Daf 97b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: In what</span> manner <span class="gemarra-regular">did you establish</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">our </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mishna </span>as dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with the danger </span>posed <span class="gemarra-regular">by gentiles? Say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the mishna as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one gives them to another and the other </span>passes them <span class="gemarra-regular">to another. </span>In that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter be conspicuous, </span>and they should fear the decree issued by the gentiles. 
The Gemara answers: The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">incomplete and is teaching the following: In what case is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this statement </span>that the finder covers the phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is where the concern is <span class="gemarra-regular">danger </span>posed by <span class="gemarra-regular">gentiles. However</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>where the concern is <span class="gemarra-regular">danger </span>posed by <span class="gemarra-regular">bandits, one carries</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them less than four cubits at a time. </span>In that case Rabbi Shimon disagrees, maintaining that it is preferable that many people carry the phylacteries.
It is stated in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gives them to another </span>and the other passes them to another. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>principle do <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree? </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that having one person carrying the phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">less than four cubits </span>at a time <span class="gemarra-regular">is preferable, as if you say </span>that the finder <span class="gemarra-regular">gives them to another, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>passes them <span class="gemarra-regular">to another, Shabbat </span>desecration <span class="gemarra-regular">will be noticeable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> thereby demeaning Shabbat’s character as a sacred day of rest.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the solution that <span class="gemarra-regular">one gives </span>the phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">to another is preferable, as if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the finder <span class="gemarra-regular">carries them less than four </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits </span>at a time, <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes it is not in his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thoughts and </span>will unwittingly <span class="gemarra-regular">come to carry </span>the phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits in the public domain. </span>That is unlikely if there are numerous people together.
It was stated in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the same </span>is true with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara is surprised: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is his son doing ther</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in the field necessitating his retrieval in this way? <span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Menashe taught: </span>It is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where his mother gave birth to him in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and he must be brought to town.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>may be inferred from the mishna’s ruling that the baby is passed from one person to the next, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if it requires <span class="gemarra-regular">a hundred </span>people? This teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that although it is difficult for </span>the child to be passed from <span class="gemarra-regular">hand </span>to hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">even so, this </span>method of transporting him <span class="gemarra-regular">is preferable </span>to his being carried by one person less than four cubits at a time.
It was stated in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: A person gives</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a barrel to another, </span>and the other may pass it to another, and in that way they may take it even beyond the Shabbat limit. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is Rabbi Yehuda not of the opinion </span>of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a mishna: The distance that <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and vessels </span>may be taken <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>the distance that <span class="gemarra-regular">the feet of the owners </span>may go with regard to Shabbat limits?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said in the name of Levi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Elder: With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">one pours </span>the water <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one barrel to </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">barrel </span>so that only the water, rather than the barrel itself, is taken beyond the limit. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda </span>follows <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as he said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Water has no substance, </span>i.e., it is not significant enough for its transfer beyond the Shabbat limit to be prohibited.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna that discusses a dispute on this issue: If one person adds flour for dough while another adds the water, the Rabbis say that the dough may only be taken as far as both owners are permitted to go, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exempts water </span>from any limit <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">it has no substance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what, </span>then, is the meaning of the Rabbis’ statement in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not go </span>farther than the feet of the owners may go, which apparently refers to the barrel? It means: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which is in this </span>barrel may <span class="gemarra-regular">not go farther than the feet of the owners </span>may go.
The Gemara rejects this explanation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Say that you heard Rabbi Yehuda </span>express <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>opinion that water has no substance in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is absorbed in dough; </span>but in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is in its pure, unadulterated </span>state <span class="gemarra-regular">did you hear </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>say so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, </span>if with regard to water <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a pot </span>of cooked food <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said </span>that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not nullified, </span>would it be <span class="gemarra-regular">nullified when it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in its pure, unadulterated </span>state? That is clearly not the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda says: Water and salt are nullified in dough, </span>as they are absorbed into it and are not independently discernible. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are not nullified in a pot </span>of cooked food, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the water and salt are discernible in <span class="gemarra-regular">its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gravy. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Rava </span>rejected this explanation and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Here, we are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dealing with a barrel </span>that belonged to a particular individual who <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired residence </span>at the start of Shabbat in a specific location, <span class="gemarra-regular">and water that did not </span>remain in one place, i.e., spring or river water, and that does not belong to any individual who <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired residence. </span>In that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">the barrel is nullified relative to the water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since the barrel is designated to hold the water.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who carries</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out a living person on a bed </span>from one domain to another on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">is exempt even for </span>carrying out <span class="gemarra-regular">the bed, due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the bed is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> secondary to </span>the person. He is exempt for carrying out the living person because a living being carries itself, i.e., the person being carried lightens the load and thereby assists those bearing him. 
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who carries out </span>an amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">food, less than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the measure </span>that determines liability for carrying out food on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">in a vessel is exempt, even for </span>carrying out <span class="gemarra-regular">the vessel, due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the vessel is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> secondary to </span>the food inside it. By the same reasoning, the barrel should be nullified relative to the water it contains.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef raised an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">objection </span>from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>If members of <span class="gemarra-regular">a caravan </span>camped in a field wish to drink, one <span class="gemarra-regular">person gives a barrel to another, and the other</span> passes it <span class="gemarra-regular">to another. </span>By inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">In a caravan, yes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is permitted to do so due to exigent circumstances; however, in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not a caravan, no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is prohibited. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Yosef said: When we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">in the mishna as well, we learned </span>it with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to a caravan. </span>The Sages were lenient in the case of a caravan due to the lack of water.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>that this explanation is unnecessary: <span class="gemarra-regular">In a caravan, even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the barrel acquired residence </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the water acquired residence, </span>it is permitted to move them. If one is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in a caravan, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">barrel acquired residence and the water did not acquire residence, </span>it is prohibited to move them. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Here, we are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dealing with an ownerless barrel and ownerless water, </span>neither of which acquired residence as they do not belong to anyone. <span class="gemarra-regular">And who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> about whom it says in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">they said to </span>Rabbi Yehuda that it may not go farther than the feet of its owners may go? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, </span>who, consistent with his approach, <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless objects acquire residence </span>where they were located when Shabbat began, and it is prohibited to move them beyond their limit. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>is the meaning of the statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not go farther </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than the feet of its owners </span>may go, as it has no owner? It means that the barrel and water may <span class="gemarra-regular">not go farther than vessels that have owners, </span>i.e., they may not be moved beyond their limit. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who <span class="gemarra-regular">was reading </span>a sacred <span class="gemarra-regular">book </span>in scroll form on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>an elevated, wide <span class="gemarra-regular">threshold</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> book rolled from his hand </span>into the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span> may <span class="gemarra-regular">roll it </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">to himself, </span>since one of its ends remains in his hand. 
If <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was reading on top the roof, </span>which is a full-fledged private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the book rolled from his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as long as </span>the edge of the book <span class="gemarra-regular">did not reach </span>within <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths </span>above the public domain, the book is still in its own domain, and he may <span class="gemarra-regular">roll it </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">to himself. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">once the book </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has reached </span>within <span class="gemarra-regular">ten handbreadths </span>above the public domain, it is prohibited to roll the book back to oneself. In that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may only <span class="gemarra-regular">turn it </span>over <span class="gemarra-regular">onto the </span>side with <span class="gemarra-regular">writing, </span>so that the writing of the book will be facedown and not exposed and degraded. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: Even </span>if the scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">is removed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only a needle breadth from the ground, he rolls it</span> back <span class="gemarra-regular">to himself. Rabbi Shimon says: Even if </span>the scroll is <span class="gemarra-regular">on the ground itself, he rolls it </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> himself, as you have nothing</span> that was instituted <span class="gemarra-regular">as a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rabbinic decree</span> to enhance the character of Shabbat as a day of <span class="gemarra-regular">rest</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">stands</span> as an impediment <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the rescue of <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred writings.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara questions the first clause of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances of this threshold? If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you say </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a threshold </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">a private domain, and </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a public domain before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it, and </span>the mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not issue</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a decree lest </span>the entire scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">fall </span>from one’s hand <span class="gemarra-regular">and he come to bring it </span>from a public to a private domain, 

Daf 98a

<span class="gemarra-regular">who is </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is Rabbi Shimon, who said: Anything that </span>is prohibited on Shabbat and its prohibition is not by Torah law, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">rabbinic decree</span> issued to enhance the character of Shabbat as a day of rest <span class="gemarra-regular">stands</span> as an impediment <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the rescue of <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred writings. </span>But if it is the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">say the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> latter clause </span>of the mishna as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Even if </span>the scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">is removed only a needle breadth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the ground, he rolls it </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">to himself; </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: Even if </span>the scroll is <span class="gemarra-regular">on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ground itself, he rolls it </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">to himself. </span>
Is it possible that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> cited in <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first clause </span>of the mishna is Rabbi Shimon, as claimed above, while it is explicitly stated that <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause</span> represents the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and yet its <span class="gemarra-regular">middle clause </span>reflects the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda? Rav Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Yes, </span>that is the correct, albeit unconventional, explanation. <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first and last clauses </span>are in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">the middle clause </span>of the mishna reflects the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said </span>that the mishna may be understood differently. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, we are dealing with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a threshold that is trodden upon </span>by the public, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the potential <span class="gemarra-regular">degradation of the sacred writing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sages permitted </span>one to violate the rabbinic decree. It would be disgraceful if people were to trample over sacred writings.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised an objection to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his </span>explanation: It was taught that if the scroll rolled <span class="gemarra-regular">within four cubits, he rolls it </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">to himself; </span>if it rolled <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond four cubits, he turns it over </span><span class="gemarra-regular">onto </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">writing. And if you say we are dealing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with a threshold that is trodden on </span>by the public, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>difference is there <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>whether it remained <span class="gemarra-regular">within</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four cubits </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>difference is there <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>if it rolled <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond four cubits? </span>Since the prohibition is a rabbinic decree, not a Torah prohibition, why isn’t one permitted to move the scroll in both cases to prevent the degradation of the sacred writings? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Abaye said: Here, we are dealing with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a threshold </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as the threshold is four handbreadths wide but is less than ten handbreadths high. Furthermore, on one side of the <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> there is a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a public domain passes before it.</span>
The reason for the different rulings is as follows: If the scroll rolled <span class="gemarra-regular">within</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four cubits, </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the entire scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">falls </span>out of the one’s hand <span class="gemarra-regular">and he brings it </span>back, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>cann<span class="gemarra-regular">ot incur liability </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering, </span>as the prohibition against carrying from a public domain to a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> is a rabbinic decree. Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages permitted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>to roll it back to himself, as there is no danger of transgressing a Torah prohibition.
However, if it rolled <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond four cubits, so that if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he brings it </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">he incurs liability </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offering, </span>as carrying an object four cubits in the public domain is prohibited by Torah law, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not permit him </span>to roll it back. In this case, if he forgot and carried the scroll instead of rolling it, he would be violating a severe prohibition.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, let us likewise issue a decree</span> in the case where the scroll remained <span class="gemarra-regular">within four cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, lest he bring </span>the scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">in from the public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the private domain, </span>i.e., to his house. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lest you say: Since a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> separates </span>the public and private domains <span class="gemarra-regular">we have no </span>problem <span class="gemarra-regular">with it, </span>as nothing is directly carried from one domain to the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t Rava say: One who carries an object from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the beginning of four </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">to the end of four </span>cubits in the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he carried it by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> way of </span>the airspace <span class="gemarra-regular">above his head</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> liable, even though </span>the object remained more than ten handbreadths off the ground and passed from the beginning to the end of four cubits by way of an exempt zone? Here, too, one should be liable for carrying the scroll from the public domain to a private domain by way of a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an extended threshold</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the meantime, </span>while he is carrying the scroll along the length of the threshold, <span class="gemarra-regular">he will remember </span>not to bring it into the private domain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a threshold that is not extended; </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinarily one peruses</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sacred writings and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">puts them </span>in their place. Consequently, there is no concern that he might pass directly from the public to the private domain, as he will pause on the threshold to read the scroll. The Gemara asks: According to this explanation too, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us be concerned </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lest he </span>pause to <span class="gemarra-regular">peruse </span>the scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domain, and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">carry it directly into the private domain </span>without pausing in the <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>.
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ben Azzai, who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">walking is considered like standing. </span>Consequently, one who passes through the <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> is considered to have paused and stood there. Therefore, the object was not transferred directly from the public domain to the private domain, as he paused in the <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>what of the concern <span class="gemarra-regular">lest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he throw </span>the scrolls inside, rather than carry them by hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Ben Azzai concedes </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who throws </span>an object from the public domain to a private domain by way of an exempt domain is liable?
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Ahava said: That is to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not throw sacred writings</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as this is demeaning to them. Consequently, there is no concern that one might throw the scrolls rather than carry them by hand.
It was stated in the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reading on top of the roof</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is a full-fledged private domain, and the scroll rolled from his hand, as long as the edge of the scroll did not reach ten handbreadths above the public domain, he may roll it back to himself. However, once the scroll reached within ten handbreadths above the public domain, it is prohibited to roll it back. In that case, he should turn it over, so that the writing of the scroll will be facedown and not be exposed and degraded. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is it permitted </span>to do so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">writers of scrolls, phylacteries, and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mezuzot</span> who interrupt their work, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">did not permit them to turn the sheet</span> of parchment <span class="gemarra-regular">facedow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> lest it become soiled? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one spreads a cloth over it </span>in a respectful manner.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>with regard to scribes, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is possible </span>to cover the parchment respectfully; <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not possibl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to do so. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he does not turn </span>the scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">over, it will be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">more degrading to the sacred writings. </span>Consequently, although this is not an ideal solution, it is preferable to turn it over rather than leave the scroll exposed.
The mishna states: Once the scroll has reached within ten handbreadths above the public domain, it is prohibited to roll it back to oneself, and <span class="gemarra-regular">one turns it over onto the writing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>why is this prohibited? Since the scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">did not </span>come to <span class="gemarra-regular">rest </span>in the public domain, rolling it back to oneself should not be prohibited. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>This teaching is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to an inclined wall. </span>Although the scroll did not reach the ground, it came to rest within the confines of the public domain. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: In what </span>manner <span class="gemarra-regular">did you establish </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an inclined wall? Say the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> latter clause </span>of the mishna as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Even </span>if the scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">is removed only a needle </span><span class="gemarra-regular">breadth from the ground, he rolls it </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">to himself. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t </span>the scroll come to <span class="gemarra-regular">rest </span>in the public domain? It shouldn’t matter whether or not the scroll is in contact with the ground.
The Gemara answers: The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete and is teaching the following: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an inclined wall. However, </span>

Daf 98b

<span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wall that is not inclined, </span>the following distinction applies: If the end of the scroll is <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">roll it </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">to himself; </span>but if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">below three </span>handbreadths from the ground, it is considered as though the scroll is on the ground, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he must </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">turn it </span>facedown <span class="gemarra-regular">onto the writing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
It was stated in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: Even </span>if the scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">removed only </span>a needle breadth <span class="gemarra-regular">from the ground, </span>one rolls it back to himself. The Gemara explains: Rabbi Yehuda maintains <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>in order for an object to be deemed at rest, <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>that it <span class="gemarra-regular">rest atop something. </span>Consequently, a scroll that is not actually touching the ground is not considered resting and may be rolled back. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>consider <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>with regard to an object located <span class="gemarra-regular">within thre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> handbreadths of the ground. Rava said that according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who disagree with Rabbi Akiva and claim that something in the air is not considered to be at rest, nevertheless, for one to incur liability <span class="gemarra-regular">it is necessary </span>for the object to <span class="gemarra-regular">rest </span>on a surface. <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>only one of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but not in accordance with all of them. This is an unacceptable conclusion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Gemara rejects the previous explanation in favor of the following one: The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is all </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, and it is incomplete and is teaching</span> the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement </span>that once the end of the scroll is within ten handbreadths of the ground it may not be rolled back <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It was said in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an inclined wall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But with regard to a wall that is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inclined, even </span>if the end of the scroll is <span class="gemarra-regular">less </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than three handbreadths </span>from the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">roll it </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">to himself, as Rabbi Yehuda says: Even </span>if the scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">is removed only a needle breadth from the ground, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he rolls it </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">to himself.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the reason </span>for this ruling? The reasoning is that for an object to be considered at rest, <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>that it <span class="gemarra-regular">rest atop some </span>surface. Consequently, if the scroll is not actually touching the ground, it is not considered at rest, even if it is less than three handbreadths from the ground.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ledge in front of a window, </span>that is ten handbreadths high and four handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>objects <span class="gemarra-regular">upon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it or remove </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">from it on Shabbat </span>via the window. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">This ledge, to where does it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> protrude? If you say </span>that the ledge <span class="gemarra-regular">protrudes into </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a public domain, </span>one should be prohibited to place an object on it, as <span class="gemarra-regular">we should be concerned lest </span>the object <span class="gemarra-regular">fall and he </span>will forget and <span class="gemarra-regular">come to bring </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it in </span>from the public domain to a private domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the ledge <span class="gemarra-regular">protrudes into a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">private domain; </span>but if so, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that it is permitted to place objects on it and to remove them. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Actually, </span>the mishna is dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it protrudes into a public domain, and what </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches: One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>objects <span class="gemarra-regular">upon it? </span>This refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">fragile utensils</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which would break instantly if they fell. Consequently, there is no concern that one might then bring them in from the public domain to the private domain.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">That was also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a ledge in front of a windo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that protrudes into a public domain, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">place on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it bowls, cups, small cups [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kitoniyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and saucers. </span>All of these utensils are made of fragile glass or earthenware, which supports Abaye’s opinion.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">use</span> this ledge along the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>length of <span class="gemarra-regular">the wall, </span>if the ledge spans its length, whether in close proximity to the window or removed from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">until the lower ten</span> handbreadths of the wall, but not if the ledge is lower than that. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if there is one </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">ledge</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> below it </span>but still ten handbreadths above the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span> may <span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>the lower ledge along the entire length of the wall; <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to the upper </span>ledge, <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span> may <span class="gemarra-regular">use it only opposite his window</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>upper <span class="gemarra-regular">ledge, what are its circumstances? If it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not four </span>handbreadths deep, although <span class="gemarra-regular">it is an exempt domain</span> with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of Shabbat, which means it does not pose a problem in itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">one should </span>nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">even opposite his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">window, </span>as anything placed on this narrow ledge is likely to fall. Consequently, it is as though he has thrown the object directly to the ground. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths deep, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him use </span>the ledge along the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>length of the ledge along <span class="gemarra-regular">the wall.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>We are dealing with a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the lower</span> ledge <span class="gemarra-regular">is four </span>handbreadths deep <span class="gemarra-regular">and the upper </span>ledge <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not four </span>handbreadths deep, but the <span class="gemarra-regular">windowsill </span>on the inside <span class="gemarra-regular">completes it to </span>form a surface <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths deep. Accordingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>the part of the upper ledge <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite the window, as it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">an extension of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the window, </span>but the parts <span class="gemarra-regular">to this side or to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that side </span>of the window are <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, </span>as they are less than four handbreadths deep. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">stand in a private</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> domain and move </span>objects that are <span class="gemarra-regular">in a public domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as there is no concern that he might mistakenly bring them into the private domain. Similarly, one may stand <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a public domain and move </span>objects <span class="gemarra-regular">in a private domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, provided that he does not carry </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond four cubits</span> in the public domain, which is prohibited on Shabbat.
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not stand in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a private domain and urinate into a public domain, </span>nor may one stand <span class="gemarra-regular">in a public domain and urinate into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a private domain. And likewise, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not spit </span>in such a manner that the spittle passes from a private domain to a public domain or vice versa.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: Even once </span>a person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">spittle is gathered in his mouth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not walk four cubits </span>in the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">until he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spits </span>it out, for he would be carrying the accumulated spittle in his mouth, which is akin to carrying any other object.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥinnana bar Shelamiya would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teach </span>this mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">to Ḥiyya bar Rav before Rav </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not stand in a private domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and move </span>objects that are <span class="gemarra-regular">in a public domain. </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Have <span class="gemarra-regular">you abandoned </span>the majority opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and followed </span>the solitary dissenting opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>who is stringent in this regard? 

Daf 99a

The Gemara explains: Rav Ḥinnana <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains that from </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the mishna, was taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>it can be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">likewise </span>taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir. But </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not so: The latter clause </span>is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, while the first clause </span>is in accordance with that of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis.</span>
We learned in the mishna: One may move objects in a public domain when he is standing in a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that he does not carry </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond </span>four cubits in the public domain. The Gemara infers: This teaching indicates that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he carried </span>them beyond four cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as Rava said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who carries an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">object </span>in a public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">from the beginning of four </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">to the end of </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>cubits, even if he <span class="gemarra-regular">carried it above his head, </span>i.e., he lifted the object above his head so that it passed through an exempt place, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>for carrying four cubits in a public domain. Here, too, although he is standing in an elevated private domain and carries the object at that elevated height, he is still liable.
The Gemara rejects this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if he carried </span>the object beyond four cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">he is liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering? Perhaps </span>the mishna means: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he carried </span>the object beyond four cubits, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from bringing a sin-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>by rabbinic decree to do so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>a different version of the previous discussion: The Gemara’s initial inference was actually that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he carried </span>the object beyond four cubits he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from bringing a sin-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">but it is prohibited </span>by rabbinic decree to do so. The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us say </span>that this <span class="gemarra-regular">is a conclusive refutation </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava’s </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rava said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who carries </span>an object in a public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the beginning of four </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">to the end of </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>cubits, even if he <span class="gemarra-regular">carried it above his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">head, he is liable. </span>The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if he took </span>it beyond four cubits he is <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt, but it is prohibited </span>to do so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> means that <span class="gemarra-regular">if he carried </span>it beyond four cubits, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offering.</span>
The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not stand </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in a private domain </span>and urinate or spit into the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: One who urinated or spat </span>in this manner is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>for an act of carrying to be considered a prohibited Shabbat labor that entails liability, <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">lifting and placing </span>of the object be performed <span class="gemarra-regular">from atop </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an area four </span>by four handbreadths, the minimal size of significance with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of carrying on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the case here, as one’s mouth, which produces the spittle, is not four by four handbreadths in size.
The Gemara answers: One’s <span class="gemarra-regular">intent renders it an are</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> of significance, i.e., as one certainly considers his mouth a significant area, it is regarded as four by four handbreadths in size. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you do not say so, </span>that the size of an area is not the sole criterion, but that a person’s thoughts can also establish a place as significant, there is a difficulty with <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person threw </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">and it landed in the mouth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a do</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or in the mouth of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">furnace, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering. But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> don’t we require </span>that the object be <span class="gemarra-regular">placed on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an area of four </span>by four handbreadths? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the case here.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">intent </span>to throw the object into the dog’s mouth <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it an area </span>of significance. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, his intent renders </span>his own mouth <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>significant <span class="gemarra-regular">area.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>is standing <span class="gemarra-regular">in a private domain, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the opening of his </span>male <span class="gemarra-regular">member is in the public </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and he urinates, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? How should this case be regarded? Do <span class="gemarra-regular">we follow </span>the domain where the urine is <span class="gemarra-regular">uprooted </span>from the body, i.e., the bladder, which is in the private domain? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">we follow the </span>point of the urine’s actual <span class="gemarra-regular">emission </span>from the body, and since the urine leaves his body through the opening of his member in the public domain, no prohibition has been violated? Since this dilemma was not resolved, the Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let it stand </span>unresolved.
The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not spit</span> from one domain to another. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>Once a person’s spittle is gathered in his mouth, he may not walk four cubits in the public domain until he removes it. The Gemara asks: Does this teaching mean that it is prohibited to do so <span class="gemarra-regular">even if he has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not turned </span>the spittle <span class="gemarra-regular">ove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> in his mouth, i.e., after he has dredged up the saliva but before he has rolled it around in his mouth in preparation to spit it out? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learn </span>in a mishna the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">was eating a dried fig </span>of <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with unwashed hands?</span> By Torah law, only food that has come into contact with a liquid is susceptible to ritual impurity, and no liquid had ever fallen on this fig. The significance of the fact that his hands are unwashed is that by rabbinic law, unwashed hands have second degree ritually impurity status and therefore invalidate <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. If this person <span class="gemarra-regular">inserted his hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into his mouth to remove a pebble, Rabbi Meir deems</span> the dried fig <span class="gemarra-regular">impure, </span>as it had been rendered liable to contract impurity by the spittle in the person’s mouth, and it subsequently became impure when it was touched by his unwashed hand. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei deems </span>the fig <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pure, </span>as he maintains that spittle which is still in one’s mouth is not considered liquid that renders food liable to contract impurity; the spittle does so only after it has left the mouth. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says </span>that there is a distinction between the cases: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he turned </span>the spittle <span class="gemarra-regular">over </span>in his mouth, it is like spittle that has been detached from its place, and it therefore its legal status is that of a liquid, which means the fig is <span class="gemarra-regular">impure. </span>However, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">turned</span> the spittle <span class="gemarra-regular">over </span>in his mouth, the fig is <span class="gemarra-regular">pure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This indicates that according to Rabbi Yehuda, spittle that has not yet been turned over in one’s mouth is not considered detached. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The </span>attribution of the <span class="gemarra-regular">opinions</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is reversed, </span>as the opinion attributed to Rabbi Yehuda is actually that of a different <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, while Rabbi Yehuda himself maintains that the fig is ritually impure in either case. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: Actually, do not reverse</span> the opinions, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the apparent contradiction can be reconciled in accordance with the original version of the text: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we are dealing here </span>in the mishna? We are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with his phlegm </span>that is expelled through coughing. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty against this resolution. <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s phlegm was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> detached, </span>he may not walk four cubits in the public domain with it in his mouth? <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not</span> the case that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">spittle that was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> detached? </span>The Gemara rejects this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this ruling applies only to <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s phlegm that was detached. </span>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s phlegm was detached</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and likewise, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">his spittle was detached, he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> walk four cubits </span>in the public domain <span class="gemarra-regular">before he spits</span> it out, even if he has not yet turned it over. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, it is clear as we originally answered, </span>that the opinions in the mishna with regard to spittle and ritual impurity must be reversed.
Having mentioned phlegm, the Gemara cites a related teaching: <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: </span>One who expelled <span class="gemarra-regular">phlegm in front of his maste</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> has acted in a disrespectful manner and is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable for </span>the punishment of <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>at the hand of  Heaven, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is stated: “All they who hate M</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> love death” </span>(Proverbs 8:36). <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not read it </span>as: <span class="gemarra-regular">“They who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hate [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mesanai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] Me”; rather, </span>read it as: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Those who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> make themselves hateful [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">masniai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to Me,” </span>i.e., those who make themselves hateful by such a discharge.
The Gemara expresses surprise at this ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t he </span>do so <span class="gemarra-regular">involuntarily, </span>as no one coughs and emits phlegm by choice; why should this be considered a transgression? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">We are speaking </span>here of someone who had <span class="gemarra-regular">phlegm </span>in his mouth <span class="gemarra-regular">and spat </span>it out, i.e., one who had the opportunity to leave his master’s presence and spit outside. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">stand in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a private domain </span>and extend his head <span class="gemarra-regular">and drink in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a public domain, </span>and he may stand <span class="gemarra-regular">in a public </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domain and drink in a private domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he brings his head and most of his </span>body <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the domain </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">which he drinks. And the same </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">in a winepress, </span>as will be explained in the Gemara. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara registers surprise at the mishna: It would seem that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause, </span>i.e., the previous mishna, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who maintain that a person located in one domain is permitted to move objects in another domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas the latter clause, </span>i.e., this mishna, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>who maintains that it is prohibited for a person in one domain to move objects in a different domain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>This mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to objects that one needs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the ruling is accepted by <span class="gemarra-regular">all. </span>In this case, even the Rabbis concede that it is prohibited to move objects in another domain, lest one absent-mindedly draw the objects to him and thereby violate a Torah prohibition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: If one of the domains is a <span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: This </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>equal <span class="gemarra-regular">to that </span>case, i.e., in this situation a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> is governed by the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that applies to a domain defined by Torah law. Just as the Sages prohibited one in the private domain from drinking from the public domain and vice versa, so too, they prohibited one in a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> from drinking in the same manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>How can you say so? The prohibition against carrying to or from a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">itself </span>a rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree. And will we </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">proceed to issue a decree to </span>prevent violation of another <span class="gemarra-regular">decree? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>in explanation of his opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do I say that </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is taught </span>in the mishna: 

Daf 99b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> same </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">in a winepress. </span>This winepress cannot be a private domain, as the first clause of the mishna already dealt with a private domain. The winepress must therefore be a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, which proves that it is prohibited to drink from a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> while standing in a public domain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava said: </span>This proof is not conclusive, as the words: The same applies in a winepress, do not refer to Shabbat but <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> matter of </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">tithes, </span>as explained below. <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, Rav Sheshet said </span>that the statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">same </span>applies <span class="gemarra-regular">in a winepress </span>refers <span class="gemarra-regular">to the matter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of tithes. </span>
The Gemara clarifies this statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">drink </span>grape juice directly <span class="gemarra-regular">on the winepress</span> <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span> without tithing, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the juice was diluted <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hot </span>water, even though he will then be unable to return the leftover wine to the press, as it would ruin all the wine in the press, <span class="gemarra-regular">or whether </span>the juice was diluted <span class="gemarra-regular">with cold </span>water, in which case he could return the leftover wine without ruining the rest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he is exempt. </span>Drinking that way is considered incidental drinking, and anything that is not a fixed meal is exempt from tithing. That is the <span class="gemarra-regular">statement of Rabbi Meir. </span>This is the <span class="gemarra-regular">statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Eliezer bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Tzadok deems </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to tithe in both cases. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: </span>There is a distinction between these two cases. When the juice is diluted <span class="gemarra-regular">with hot </span>water, since one cannot return what is left of the juice to the press, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> obligated </span>to tithe it, as this drinking is like fixed drinking for which one is obligated to tithe. However, when the juice is diluted <span class="gemarra-regular">with cold </span>water, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from tithing it, <span class="gemarra-regular">because he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">return the leftover</span> juice to the press. Therefore, it is considered incidental drinking, which is exempt from tithing. The teaching of the mishna: The same applies to a winepress, is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, as it teaches that that the leniency to drink without separating tithes applies only if the drinker’s head and most of his body are in the winepress.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>standing in a public domain on Shabbat may <span class="gemarra-regular">catch </span>water in a vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">from a gutter</span> running along the side of a roof, if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than ten handbreadths </span>off the ground, which is part of the public domain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And from a pip</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that protrudes from the roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">drink in any manner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., not only by catching the water in a vessel, but even by pressing his mouth directly against the spout.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A careful reading of the mishna indicates that to <span class="gemarra-regular">catch, yes, </span>one may catch the water from a distance, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">press </span>his hand or mouth to the gutter, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>that is prohibited. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this distinction? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Here, we are dealing with a gutter within three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">of the roof, </span>and the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">anything within three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">of a roof </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is considered like the roof </span>itself, based on the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span>, according to which two solid surfaces are considered joined if there is a gap of less than three handbreadths between them. Since the roof of the house is a private domain, one would be carrying from a private domain to a public domain, which is prohibited. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>ruling, that there is a distinction between catching water falling from a gutter and pressing one’s hand or mouth to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">stand in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a private domain and raise his hand above ten handbreadths, </span>until it is <span class="gemarra-regular">within three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">of the roof, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">catch </span>any water falling from his neighbor’s roof in a vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that he does not press </span>his hand or mouth to the roof.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not stand in a private domain and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">raise his hand above ten handbreadths, to within three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">of the roof, and press </span>his hand to the gutter, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">catch </span>water falling from the gutter <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">drink. </span>
It was stated in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">But from a pipe one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">drink in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> any manner, </span>as it protrudes more than three handbreadths from the roof. A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pipe </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">is four by four </span>handbreadths wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited </span>to stand in the public domain and press one’s hand or mouth to the water, <span class="gemarra-regular">because he is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">carries from one domain to </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">domain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as the pipe is considered a domain in its own right. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a public domain, with an embankment ten handbreadths high</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the embankment constitutes a private domain by itself, if there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a windo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>the cistern, i.e., the window of an adjacent house is situated above the cistern, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">draw </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>through the window, as it is permitted to carry from one private domain to another. 
Similarly, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a garbage dump in a public domain </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handbreadths high, </span>which means it has the status of a private domain, if there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a window above </span>the pile of refuse that abuts the garbage dump, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">throw</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> water </span>from the window <span class="gemarra-regular">onto </span>the dump <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat, </span>as it is permitted to carry from one private domain to another.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dealing </span>here? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>we are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a cistern that is <span class="gemarra-regular">adjacent </span>to the wall of the house, i.e. the cistern and wall are separated by less than four handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the cistern’s <span class="gemarra-regular">embankment </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths high? Presumably the cistern is ten handbreadths deep, which makes it a private domain, and as it is too close to the house for the public domain to pass between them, one should be permitted to draw water from the cistern through the window, regardless of the height of the embankment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: With what we are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dealing here? </span>With a case where the cistern or garbage dump is <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">removed from the wall </span>of the house, i.e., a public domain separates the house from the cistern or heap. It is prohibited to carry from one private domain to another by way of a public domain. However, if the cistern’s embankment is ten handbreadths high, the one drawing the water transfers it by way of an area that is more than ten handbreadths above the public domain, which is an exempt domain. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the reason </span>that drawing the water is permitted is <span class="gemarra-regular">that there is an embankment</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of ten </span>handbreadths; but <span class="gemarra-regular">if there is no embankment of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ten </span>handbreadths, it is prohibited, as this would involve <span class="gemarra-regular">moving </span>objects <span class="gemarra-regular">from one private domain to another by way </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the public domain.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>The above explanation is unnecessary. <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that we are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a cistern that is <span class="gemarra-regular">adjacent </span>to the wall of the house, the mishna comes to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us that a cistern and its embankment combine to </span>complete the <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths required for a private domain, and it is not necessary that the embankment itself reach a height of ten handbreadths.
The mishna states: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a garbage dump in a public domain </span>that is ten handbreadths high, if there is a window above the heap, one may throw water from the window onto the heap on Shabbat. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Aren’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we concerned that the </span>entire <span class="gemarra-regular">garbage dump </span>or part of it <span class="gemarra-regular">might be removed, </span>turning the area into a public domain, and people will continue to throw water onto it on Shabbat?
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t Ravin bar Rav Adda </span>say that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yitzḥak </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: An incident </span>occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">involving a certain alleyway, one of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whose sides terminated in the sea, </span>which closed it off on one side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the other side </span>of which <span class="gemarra-regular">terminated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in a garbage dump. And the incident came before Rabbi</span> Yehuda HaNasi for his ruling as to whether the alleyway has the status of an alleyway closed on both sides, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he did not say </span>anything <span class="gemarra-regular">about it, either prohibition</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or permission</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara clarifies: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say about it </span>that carrying in the alleyway is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as we are concerned lest the garbage dump be removed</span> from its present spot, leaving one side of the alleyway open, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>we are likewise concerned that perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">the sea</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will throw up sediment </span>and recede. These sedimentary deposits will intervene between the end of the alleyway and the sea, thereby depriving the alleyway of one its partitions. 
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not say about it </span>that carrying in the alleyway was <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, as </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">partitions, </span>the sea and the garbage dump, indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">exist, </span>and it was certainly permitted at that time to carry in the alleyway. Apparently, there is indeed a concern that a garbage dump might be removed; why, then, does the same concern not apply to the case in the mishna? 
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case, with regard to the alleyway between the garbage dump and the sea, we are concerned, as we are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with a private </span>garbage dump, whose owner might change his mind and remove it; whereas in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, i.e., the case in the mishna, it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a public </span>heap, which will certainly remain fixed in place. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was hanging ove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., its branches hung down on all sides like a tent so that it threw a shadow on the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">if</span> the tips of <span class="gemarra-regular">its branches are no higher than three</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handbreadths from the ground, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">carry under it. </span>This applies even if the tree is planted in a public domain, as the branches form partitions which turn the enclosed area into a private domain. 
If <span class="gemarra-regular">its roots </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths higher than the ground, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not sit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on them, </span>as it is prohibited to use a tree on Shabbat. Any part of a tree that is three handbreadths above the ground has the status of a tree with regard to this prohibition.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: One</span> may <span class="gemarra-regular">not move </span>objects in the area <span class="gemarra-regular">under </span>the tree if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">more than two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this prohibition? 

Daf 100a

This was prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is a dwelling</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that serves </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">the air, </span>i.e., it is used only by someone guarding the fields or the like. It is not used as permanent living quarters, despite its partitions. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the rule with respect to <span class="gemarra-regular">any dwelling that serves</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">the air </span>is that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not permitted to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> carry in it </span>if its area is <span class="gemarra-regular">more than two</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>As it is not a proper place of residence, the Sages treated it as an enclosure. 
The mishna states: If <span class="gemarra-regular">the roots </span>of the tree are three handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the ground, </span>one may not sit on them on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the roots of a tree that </span>rise up and then bend and <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>down <span class="gemarra-regular">from above</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>a height of <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">to within three </span>handbreadths of the ground. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: It is permitted to use them, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: It is prohibited to use them.</span>
The Gemara clarifies the rationale of each opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted to use them, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">anything less than </span><span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from the ground is </span>considered as <span class="gemarra-regular">the ground.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Sheshet said: It is prohibited to use them; since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they come from a prohibited source, they are prohibited. </span>The section of the tree from which they grow is prohibited. Therefore, these roots should likewise be prohibited.
The Gemara proceeds to qualify the dispute: With regard to ascending and descending roots <span class="gemarra-regular">that resemble </span>a rocky <span class="gemarra-regular">crag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">those that rise upward are </span>certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>according to all opinions; those that <span class="gemarra-regular">fall downward are permitted </span>according to everyone. It is the roots that branch out <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sides </span>that are the subject of the <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute between Rabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rav Sheshet. </span>Rav Sheshet prohibits using them, while Rabba is lenient. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise, </span>Rabba and Rav Sheshet disagree about <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that grows in a ditc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> that has elevated roots, some of which are concealed by the banks of the ditch. The <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> dispute whether the roots concealed by the banks are considered part of the ground. <span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in the case of a tree that grows <span class="gemarra-regular">in a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> corner </span>between two walls, they disagree as to whether the section between the walls is considered part of the ground.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye had a certain palm tree </span>that grew in his house and <span class="gemarra-regular">that projected through an opening</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the roof</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He came before Rav Yosef </span>to ask him about it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he permitted him </span>to use the first three handbreadths of the palm tree above the roof, as the tree’s lower part is treated as though it were in the ground.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Taḥlifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>to Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">He who permitted </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to you, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted it to you </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, </span>who maintains that a section of a tree concealed from view in at least two directions is considered as though it were underground. Consequently, the first three handbreadths above that section may be used on Shabbat, as they have the status of the ground. 
The Gemara expresses surprise: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious. </span>What novel element is Rav Aḥa bar Taḥlifa teaching us? The Gemara answers: It is necessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that in this case it should be permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">even according to Rav Sheshet, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">the house is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">considered full, </span>i.e., it is as though it were filled with earth, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>this would mean it is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to use </span>the section <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">roof. </span>Rav Aḥa bar Taḥlifa therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that Rav Sheshet is stringent even in this case. 
The Gemara attempts to adduce proof from the mishna, in which <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the roots</span> of the tree are <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths above the ground, one</span> may <span class="gemarra-regular">not sit on them. What are the circumstances </span>of this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the situation is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the roots <span class="gemarra-regular">do not bend over again, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious, </span>as anything higher than three handbreadths is part of the tree. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">doesn’t </span>it mean that one may not sit on them <span class="gemarra-regular">even though they bend back </span>downward to within three handbreadths of the ground? The mishna apparently indicates that if parts of the roots are more than three handbreadths above the ground, it is prohibited to use them along the rest of their entire length, as maintained by Rav Sheshet, contrary to Rabba.
The Gemara rejects this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, actually </span>the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they do not bend </span><span class="gemarra-regular">back </span>downward, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> comes to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach us </span>the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">Although </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">one side </span>of the tree the roots are <span class="gemarra-regular">level with the ground, </span>nevertheless, it is prohibited to sit on them, as the roots on the other sides are more than three handbreadths above the ground. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">roots of a tree that are three handbreadths above the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ground, or if there is </span>a hollow <span class="gemarra-regular">space beneath the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">three handbreadths, although </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">one side </span>of the tree the roots <span class="gemarra-regular">are level with the ground, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sit on them because </span>of the following rule: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not climb a tree, nor </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">one hang from a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tree </span>by one’s hands, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">lean</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> against a tree </span>on Shabbat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not climb a tree</span> on Friday <span class="gemarra-regular">while it is still day and sit there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the entire day </span>of Shabbat. This constitutes the use of the tree itself, not merely climbing it, and it is therefore prohibited. This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree and</span> to <span class="gemarra-regular">all animals; </span>one may not climb upon them, hang from them, or lean against them. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>the prohibition is not due to the effort involved in climbing, as is evident from the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern, ditch, cave, or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a fence. One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">climb up </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">climb down </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">even if they are a hundred cubits </span>deep. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If one climbed up </span>a tree, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to climb down; and it was taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>other <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to climb down. </span>The Gemara resolves this apparent contradiction: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>where it is permitted to descend, one climbed up on Friday, <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day; there, </span>where it is prohibited to descend, one climbed up on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">after nightfall. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span><span class="it-text">baraitot</span> are referring to a case where one climbed up the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">after nightfall. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>even so, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: Here, </span>it is permitted to descend, as one climbed up the tree <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>it is prohibited to descend, as the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is dealing with one who climbed <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span><span class="it-text">baraitot</span> are referring to a case where one climbed up <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and they disagree about </span>whether or not the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">penalized </span>an <span class="gemarra-regular">unwitting </span>offender <span class="gemarra-regular">due to an intentional </span>offender. One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who ruled that it is prohibited to descend, <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they penalized </span>an unwitting sinner to prevent others from climbing up on purpose and descending. Therefore, one may not come down even if he ascended by mistake. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who ruled that it is permitted, <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not penalize </span>the unwitting sinner in this manner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: </span>This dispute between the two <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">parallel to the </span>dispute of the <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who disagreed with regard to a different matter. The blood of certain sacrifices, e.g., the firstborn and tithe offerings, is sprinkled once on the altar, while the blood of other sacrifices, e.g., burnt-offerings, is sprinkled four times. They require two sprinklings that are four, i.e., two sprinklings on opposite corners, so that the blood falls on all four sides. If the blood of sacrifices <span class="gemarra-regular">that require </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one sprinkling becomes intermingled </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the blood of other sacrifices that <span class="gemarra-regular">require </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling, </span>the mixture <span class="gemarra-regular">will be sprinkled once. </span>Likewise, if the blood of sacrifices that require <span class="gemarra-regular">four sprinklings </span>becomes intermingled <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the blood of other sacrifices that require <span class="gemarra-regular">four sprinklings, </span>the mixture <span class="gemarra-regular">will be sprinkled four times. </span>
If, however, the blood of a sacrifice that requires <span class="gemarra-regular">four sprinklings </span>becomes intermingled <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the blood of a sacrifice that requires only <span class="gemarra-regular">one sprinkling, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> disagree: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>The mixture of blood <span class="gemarra-regular">is sprinkled four times. And Rabbi Yehoshua says: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is sprinkled once, </span>and this suffices for the atonement of the sacrifice.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Rabbi Yehoshua: If one sprinkles the blood only once, <span class="gemarra-regular">he transgresses </span>the prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">“you shall not diminish,” </span>which prohibits the omission of any elements of the performance of a mitzva, as he has not sprinkled the blood of the burnt-offering in the proper manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua said to</span> Rabbi Eliezer: According to your ruling, that one must sprinkle the blood four times, <span class="gemarra-regular">he transgresses </span>the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> add </span>(Deuteronomy 13:1), which prohibits the addition of elements to a mitzva, as he sprinkles the blood of the firstborn animal more times than necessary. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer said</span> to Rabbi Yehoshua: <span class="gemarra-regular">They said </span>the prohibition against adding to the mitzvot <span class="gemarra-regular">only where </span>the blood stands <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself, </span>not when it is part of a mixture. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to Rabbi Eliezer: Likewise, the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not diminish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, was stated only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the blood stands <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehoshua</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> further said </span>in defense of his position: <span class="gemarra-regular">When you sprinkle</span> four times, <span class="gemarra-regular">you have transgressed </span>the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not add</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with regard to one of the sacrifices, <span class="gemarra-regular">and you </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">performed an action with your </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">hand, </span>i.e., you transgress the Torah’s command by means of a positive act. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">when you do not sprinkle </span>four times, even if <span class="gemarra-regular">you have transgressed </span>the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not diminish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, you did not perform </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">actio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with your </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">hand. </span>If one is forced to deviate from the commands of the Torah, it is better to do so in a passive manner.
Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, sought to argue the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Rabbi Eliezer, who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said there, </span>with regard to sacrifices, that if both alternatives involve the violation of a prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">it is preferable to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stand and take action, </span>i.e., perform a positive action, <span class="gemarra-regular">here too, </span>one should <span class="gemarra-regular">climb down </span>from the tree, as it is better to perform a single positive transgression by climbing down rather than commit a passive transgression throughout the entire Shabbat by remaining on the tree. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Rabbi Yehoshua, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>with regard to sacrifices that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is preferable to sit and not take action, here</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> too, </span>one should <span class="gemarra-regular">not descend </span>from the tree.
The Gemara refutes this comparison: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps that is not </span>the case, as the two <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> are not identical. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span>might have <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>his opinion that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is preferable to stand and take action </span><span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in the case dealt with <span class="gemarra-regular">there, where one performs </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzva </span>with respect to the additional sprinklings of the burnt-offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, here, </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">one performs no mitzva </span>whatsoever by descending, <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed, he </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">not descend. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>the comparison can be rejected in a different fashion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua </span>may have <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>his opinion that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is preferable to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sit and not take action only </span>in the case dealt with <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>

Daf 100b

<span class="gemarra-regular">where one does not commit a transgression </span>by refraining from action. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, here, where one commits a transgression </span>every additional moment he remains in the tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed, he </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">descend </span>from it. 
The Gemara cites an apparent contradiction: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">both a green tree and a dry tre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> are included in the prohibition against climbing a tree, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these matters, </span>that one may not climb a tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? With regard to a green </span>tree. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a dry </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted </span>to climb it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that includes a dry tree in the prohibition is referring to a tree whose <span class="gemarra-regular">stump sends out new </span>shoots when cut; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that excludes a dry tree from the prohibition is referring to one whose <span class="gemarra-regular">stump does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not send out new </span>shoots. 
The Gemara expresses surprise at this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">You call </span>a tree whose <span class="gemarra-regular">stump sends out new </span>shoots <span class="gemarra-regular">dry? </span>This tree is not dry at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as both <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> deal with a dry tree whose stump will not send out any new shoots. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that permits climbing a dry tree, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the summer, </span>when it is evident that the tree is dead; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that prohibits climbing the tree is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the rainy season, </span>when many trees shed their leaves and it is not obvious which remain alive and which are dead.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the summer, the fruit </span>of the previous year left on the dry tree <span class="gemarra-regular">will fall off </span>when he climbs it, and climbing the tree should therefore be prohibited lest he come to pick the fruit. The Gemara answers: We are dealing here with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is no fruit </span>on the tree. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But small branches will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fall off </span>when he climbs the tree, and once again this should be prohibited in case he comes to break them off. The Gemara answers: We are dealing here <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a tree that has </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">been stripped </span>of all its small branches. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">so? But Rav arrived at </span>a place called <span class="gemarra-regular">Apsetaya and prohibited </span>its residents from climbing even <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree that had </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">been stripped of </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">its branches. </span>The Gemara answers: In truth, no prohibition was involved, but <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav found </span>an unguarded <span class="gemarra-regular">field, </span>i.e., a place where transgression was widespread, <span class="gemarra-regular">and fenced it in. </span>He added a stringency as a safeguard and prohibited an action that was fundamentally permitted.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rami </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi said: It is prohibited </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for a person to walk on grass on Shabbat, due </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is stated: “And he who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hastens with his feet sins” </span>(Proverbs 19:2). This verse teaches that mere walking occasionally involves a sin, e.g., on Shabbat, when one might uproot the grass on which he walks. 
The Gemara cites another apparent contradiction: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted to walk on grass on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited </span>to do so. The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This</span> <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to green </span>grass, which one might uproot, thereby transgressing the prohibition against reaping on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>other <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to dry </span>grass, which has already been cut off from its source of life, and therefore the prohibition of reaping is no longer in effect. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">both</span> <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> are referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to green </span>grass, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no difficulty: Here, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that prohibits walking on grass is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the summer, </span>when the grass includes seeds that might be dislodged by one’s feet, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that permits doing so is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rainy season, </span>when this problem does not exist. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span><span class="it-text">baraitot</span> are referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> summer, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which permits walking on grass, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is wearing his shoes, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>other <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which prohibits it, deals with a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where one is not wearing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his shoes, </span>as the grass might get entangled between his toes and be uprooted. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span><span class="it-text">baraitot</span> are referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is wearing his shoes, and </span>nevertheless this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> prohibits walking on grass, as it involves a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one’s shoe <span class="gemarra-regular">has a spik</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> on which the grass might get caught and be uprooted, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>other <span class="it-text">baraita</span> permits it, because it deals a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one’s shoe <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have a spike. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>are referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the shoe <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a spike, </span>and it is not difficult: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which prohibits walking on grass, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the grass is <span class="gemarra-regular">long and entangled</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and it can easily get caught on the shoe, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>other <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the grass <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">long and entangled. </span>
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And now, when we maintain </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the opinion </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon, </span>who maintains that there is no liability for a prohibited act committed unwittingly during the performance of a permitted act, <span class="gemarra-regular">all of these </span>scenarios <span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted, </span>as here too, one’s intention is merely to walk and not to uproot grass on Shabbat.
The Gemara cites another <span class="it-text">halakha</span> derived from the verse mentioned in the previous discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥama said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi said: It is prohibited for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a man to force his wife in the </span>conjugal <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., sexual relations, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And he who hastens with his feet sins” </span>(Proverbs 19:2). The term his feet is understood here as a euphemism for intercourse. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Anyone who forces his wife</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>perform <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>conjugal <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva will have unworthy children </span>as a consequence. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ika bar Ḥinnana said: What is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span>that alludes to this? <span class="gemarra-regular">“Also, that the soul</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> without knowledge is not good” </span>(Proverbs 19:2). If intercourse takes place without the woman’s knowledge, i.e., consent, the soul of the offspring will not be good.
<span class="gemarra-regular">That was also </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Also, without knowledge the soul is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not good”; this is one who forces his wife to</span> perform <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>conjugal <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva. “And he who hastens with his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> feet sins”; this is one who has intercourse </span>with his wife <span class="gemarra-regular">and repeats </span>the act in a manner that causes her pain or distress. 
The Gemara is surprised by this teaching: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? But didn’t Rava say: One who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wants all his children to be males </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">have intercourse</span> with his wife <span class="gemarra-regular">and repeat </span>the act? The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: Here, </span>where Rava issued this advice, he was referring to a husband who acts <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>his wife’s <span class="gemarra-regular">consent. There, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that condemns this behavior is referring to one who proceeds <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">consent. </span>
Apropos relations between husband and wife, the Gemara cites that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥmani said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Any woman who demands </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">her husband that </span>he fulfill his conjugal <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have sons the likes of whom did not exist even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in Moses’ generation. With regard to Moses’ generation, it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written: “Get you, wise men, and understanding, and well-known </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from each one of your tribes, and I will make </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them head over you” </span>(Deuteronomy 1:13), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is </span>later <span class="gemarra-regular">written: “So I took the heads of your tribes, wise </span><span class="gemarra-regular">men, and well-known, </span>and made them heads over you” (Deuteronomy 1:15). <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>men possessing <span class="gemarra-regular">understanding, </span>which is a more lofty quality than wisdom, Moses <span class="gemarra-regular">could not find </span>any of these.
<span class="gemarra-regular">While with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Leah, it is written: “And Leah went out to meet </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him, and said, You must come in to me, for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">indeed I have hired you </span>with my son’s mandrakes” (Genesis 30:16). Her reward for demanding that Jacob fulfill the conjugal mitzva with her was the birth of Issachar, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And of the children of Issachar, men </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and all their brethren were at their commandment” </span>(I Chronicles 12:33).
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Is it proper for a woman to demand her conjugal rights from her husband? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rav Yitzḥak bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Avdimi say: Eve was cursed with ten curses, </span>due to the sin of the Tree of Knowledge, as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: </span>“To the woman He said, I will greatly multiply your pain and your travail; in sorrow you shall bring forth children; and yet your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you” (Genesis 3:16)?
Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi <span class="gemarra-regular">proceeds</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>explain this verse. <span class="gemarra-regular">“To the woman He said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I will greatly multiply [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">harba</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">arbe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]”; these are </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">drops of blood </span>unique to a woman, which cause her suffering, <span class="gemarra-regular">one the blood of menstruation and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the blood of virginity. “Your pain”; this is the pain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of raising children. “And your travail”; this is the pain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of pregnancy. “In sorrow you shall bring forth children”; in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with its </span>plain <span class="gemarra-regular">meaning, </span>i.e., the pain of childbirth.
<span class="gemarra-regular"> “And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">yet your desire shall be to your husband” teaches that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the woman desires her husband, </span>e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">when he sets </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out on the road; “and he shall rule over you” </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that the woman demands </span>her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">heart </span>but is too shy to voice her desire, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">man demands </span>his wife <span class="gemarra-regular">verbally. </span>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is a good trait in women</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that they refrain from formulating their desire verbally. Apparently, it is improper for a woman to demand her conjugal rights from her husband. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When we say </span>that a woman who demands her conjugal rights from her husband is praiseworthy, it does not mean she should voice her desires explicitly. Rather, it means <span class="gemarra-regular">that she </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">make herself </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pleasing to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and he will understand what she wants on his own.
The Gemara analyzes the above statement with regard to Eve’s ten curses: Are they in fact ten? <span class="gemarra-regular">They are </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">seven. When Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span>that the other curses are: A woman is <span class="gemarra-regular">wrapped like a mourner, </span>i.e., she must cover her head; and she is <span class="gemarra-regular">ostracized from all people and incarcerated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">within a prison, </span>as she typically spends all her time in the house.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the meaning of ostracized from all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">people? If you say </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is forbidden </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for her to seclude herself </span>with a man, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">also forbidden </span>for a man <span class="gemarra-regular">to seclude himself </span>with women. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is forbidden </span>for her <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> marry <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>men, whereas a man can marry two women. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> that the three additional curses are: <span class="gemarra-regular">She grows </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">hair </span>long <span class="gemarra-regular">like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lilit, </span>a demon; <span class="gemarra-regular">she sits and urinates, like an animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and serves as a pillow for her husband </span>during relations.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>why doesn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">the other</span> Sage include these curses? The Gemara answers: He maintains that <span class="gemarra-regular">these are praise for her, </span>not pain, either because they are modest practices, e.g., urinating in a seated position, or because they add to her comfort, e.g., her bottom position during relations. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Ḥiyya said: What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is written: “Who teaches us by the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">beasts of the earth, and makes us wiser by the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">birds of the sky” </span>(Job 35:11)? He explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us by the beasts of the earth”; this is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the female mule, which crouches and urinates </span>and from which we learn modesty. <span class="gemarra-regular">“And makes us wiser by the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">birds of the sky”; this is the rooster, which </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">cajoles </span>the hen <span class="gemarra-regular">and then mates </span>with it.
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah had not been given, we would </span>nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned modesty from the cat, </span>which covers its excrement, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">stealing </span>is objectionable <span class="gemarra-regular">from the ant, </span>which does not take grain from another ant, <span class="gemarra-regular">and forbidden relations from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is faithful to its partner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and proper</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> relations from the rooster</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">appeases </span>the hen <span class="gemarra-regular">and then mates </span>with it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does </span>the rooster do to <span class="gemarra-regular">appease </span>the hen? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>Prior to mating, it spreads its wings as if to <span class="gemarra-regular">say this: I will buy</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you a coat that will reach </span>down to <span class="gemarra-regular">your feet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. After </span>mating, the rooster bends its head as if to <span class="gemarra-regular">say this: May the crest of this rooster fall off</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if he has </span>the wherewithal <span class="gemarra-regular">and does not buy you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one. </span>I simply have no money to do so. 

Daf 101a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the door to a rear court</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a door that opens from a house to the courtyard situated behind it, which is typically not a proper door but merely a wooden board without hinges that closes off the doorway; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">bundles of thorns </span>that seal <span class="gemarra-regular">a breach; and </span>reed <span class="gemarra-regular">mats, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>an opening <span class="gemarra-regular">with them </span>on Shabbat. This would be considered building or completing a building, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless they </span>remain <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the ground </span>even when they are open. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> contradiction </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a door, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or a mat, or a lattice [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kankan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that drag </span>along the ground and are used for closing up openings, <span class="gemarra-regular">when they are tied and suspended </span>in place <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>an opening <span class="gemarra-regular">with them on Shabbat; and needless to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>this is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival. </span>According to the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the critical factor is apparently that they must be tied and suspended, not that they have to be held up above the ground.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>ones <span class="gemarra-regular">that have a hinge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> As they are considered proper doors, closing them does not appear like building. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring even <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>doors <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">had a hinge, </span>even though they no longer have one. These partitions also bear the clear form of a door, and therefore one’s action does not have the appearance of building.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an objection </span>from another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a door</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, or a mat, or a lattice that drag </span>along the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">when they are tied and suspended </span>in place <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> they are held <span class="gemarra-regular">above the ground even by </span>as little as <span class="gemarra-regular">a hairbreadth, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>an opening <span class="gemarra-regular">with them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. However, if </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>raised in this manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not close </span>an opening <span class="gemarra-regular">with them. </span>Clearly, these doors must indeed be raised above the ground as well.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye reconciles </span>the objection <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with his reasoning, and Rava reconciles </span>the objection <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with his reasoning. </span>The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reconciles </span>the objection <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with his reasoning </span>by adding to the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: They must <span class="gemarra-regular">either have a hinge or </span>be held <span class="gemarra-regular">above the ground. Rava </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">reconciles </span>the objection <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with his reasoning, </span>as he reads: They must <span class="gemarra-regular">have had a hinge or </span>else be held <span class="gemarra-regular">above the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ground.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">branches of thorn bushes or bundles </span>of wood <span class="gemarra-regular">that were arranged </span>so that they sealed off <span class="gemarra-regular">a breach </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in a courtyard, when they are tied and suspended </span>in place, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>an opening <span class="gemarra-regular">with them on Shabbat; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and needless to say, </span>this is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a widowed doo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">drags </span>along the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not close </span>an opening <span class="gemarra-regular">with it. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a widowed door? Some say </span>it refers to a door built <span class="gemarra-regular">from a single plank, </span>which does not look like a door, <span class="gemarra-regular">and others say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a door that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not have a lower doorsill </span>(<span class="it-text">ge’onim</span>) and that touches the ground when closed.
With regard to activities that are prohibited because of their similarity to building, the Gemara cites a teaching that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: </span>When arranging a pile of wood for <span class="gemarra-regular">a fire </span>on a Festival, if the logs are arranged <span class="gemarra-regular">from the top down, </span>i.e., the upper logs are temporarily suspended in the air while the lower logs are inserted below them, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. </span>However, if the wood is placed from <span class="gemarra-regular">the bottom </span><span class="gemarra-regular">up, it is prohibited, </span>as the arrangement of wood in the regular manner is a form of building.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the same </span>applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">eggs </span>that are to be arranged in a pile, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the same </span>applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">a cauldron </span>that is to be set down on a fire by means of supports, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the same </span>applies to a <span class="gemarra-regular">bed </span>that will be placed on its frame, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the same </span>applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">barrels </span>arranged in a cellar. In all these cases, the part that goes on top must be temporarily suspended in the air while the lower section is inserted beneath it.
With regard to bundles of thorns used to seal a breach, the Gemara cites a related incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">A certain heretic </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: Man of thorns! For it says about </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you: “The best of them is as a brier</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> (Micah 7:4), which indicates that even Israel’s best are merely thorns. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: Fool, go down to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the end of the verse: “The most upright is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> worse than a thorn hedge,” </span>a derogatory expression meant as praise. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">the best of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them is as a brier? </span>It means that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these thorns protect a breach, so the best among us</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> protect us. Alternatively: The best of them is as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a brier [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥedek</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">that they grind [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mehaddekin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nations of the world into Gehenna, as it is stated: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion, for I will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brass, and you shall beat in pieces [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vahadikot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] many peoples</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>and you shall devote their gain to God, and their substance to the God of the whole earth” (Micah 4:13).
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not stand in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">private domain and open </span>a door located <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domain </span>with a key, lest he inadvertently transfer the key from one domain to the other. Likewise, one may not stand <span class="gemarra-regular">in the public domain and open </span>a door <span class="gemarra-regular">in the private domain </span>with a key, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless </span>in the latter case <span class="gemarra-regular">he erected a partition ten handbreadths high </span>around the door and stands inside it. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Meir.</span>
The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident at the poultry dealers’ market </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in Jerusalem, </span>where they would fatten fowl for slaughter (Rabbeinu Ḥananel), <span class="gemarra-regular">and they would lock </span>the doors to their shops <span class="gemarra-regular">and plac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the key in the window that was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> over the door</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which was more than ten handbreadths off the ground, and nobody was concerned about the possible violation of any prohibition. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span>That place <span class="gemarra-regular">was a market of wool dealers. </span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis, </span>who cited the case of the poultry dealers of Jerusalem to rebut Rabbi Meir’s opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir spoke </span>to them about unlocking a door in a private domain while standing <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the public domain, and they responded </span>with an incident involving <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. As Rabba bar bar Ḥana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem, were it not </span>for the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">its doors are locked at night, one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would be liable for </span>carrying in <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span> its thoroughfares have the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">the public domain. </span>However, since Jerusalem’s doors are typically locked, it is considered one large <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, which is subject to rabbinic prohibitions. How, then, could a proof be cited from the markets of Jerusalem with regard to the transfer of objects between a public domain and a private domain, which is prohibited by Torah law? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Here, </span>the Rabbis considered Jerusalem a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> during the period <span class="gemarra-regular">before breaches were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">made in its </span>walls. Its doors did not turn it into a public domain, as they were locked. Whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>Rabbi Meir is referring to the time <span class="gemarra-regular">after breaches had </span><span class="gemarra-regular">been made in </span>the walls, and it therefore acquired the status of a public domain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: In the latter clause </span>of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">we came to </span>a different issue, i.e., the final section of the mishna is not designed to counter Rabbi Meir’s statement with regard to the public domain. Rather, it refers <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">gates of a garden</span> with an area greater than two <span class="it-text">beit</span> <span class="it-text">se’a</span> in size, whose legal status is that of a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>. Consequently, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying as follows: And likewise, </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not stand in the private domain and open </span>a door <span class="gemarra-regular">in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>neither may one stand <span class="gemarra-regular">in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and open </span>a door <span class="gemarra-regular">in the private domain, </span>

Daf 101b

<span class="gemarra-regular">unless he erected a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">partition ten handbreadths high </span>around the door and stands inside it; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. </span>The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: An incident </span>occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">at the poultry dealers’ </span><span class="gemarra-regular">market in Jerusalem, as they would lock </span>the doors to their shops <span class="gemarra-regular">and place the key in a window that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was over the door, </span>which was higher than ten handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span>That place <span class="gemarra-regular">was a market of wool </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dealers. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the entrances of garden gates </span>that open into a public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">when they have a gatehous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the inside,</span> which is a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">open and close</span> them <span class="gemarra-regular">from within. </span>This is because the lock, which is four handbreadths wide and ten handbreadths high, also constitutes a private domain. Consequently, the key may be passed from the gatehouse to the lock. However, they may not be opened or closed from without, as the key may not be passed from the public domain to the private domain of the lock. If the gatehouse is <span class="gemarra-regular">on the outside, one</span> may <span class="gemarra-regular">open and close </span>the doors <span class="gemarra-regular">from without, </span>as once again both the lock and the gatehouse are private domains. They may not, however, be opened from within, as the key may not be passed from the garden, which is a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, to the lock. If they have a gatehouse <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>from within, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there, </span>from without, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">open and close </span>the doors <span class="gemarra-regular">here and there. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not have </span>a gatehouse; <span class="gemarra-regular">neither here nor there, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited </span>to open or close the doors <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and there, </span>as one may not carry the key either in the public domain or in the garden.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise, </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">stores that open into the public </span><span class="gemarra-regular">domain: When the lock is below ten </span>handbreadths off the ground, it is in the public domain. In that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">bring a key on Shabbat eve and place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it on the threshold, </span>whose legal status is that of a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the following day he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">open and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">close </span>the door <span class="gemarra-regular">and return </span>the key <span class="gemarra-regular">to the threshold. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And when the lock is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">above ten </span>handbreadths off the ground, one may <span class="gemarra-regular">bring a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">key on Shabbat eve and place it in the lock. </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">the following day he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">open and close </span>the door <span class="gemarra-regular">and return </span>the key <span class="gemarra-regular">to its place </span>on top of the lock. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Even when the lock is above ten handbreadths </span>off the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">bring a key on Shabbat eve and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place it on the threshold, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the following day he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">open and close </span>the door <span class="gemarra-regular">and return </span>the key <span class="gemarra-regular">to its place </span>on the threshold <span class="gemarra-regular">or in the window </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is above the door.</span>
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">if the window is four by four </span>handbreadths and ten handbreadths above the ground, its status is that of a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to place the key in the window, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it would be <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">though one is transferring </span>the key <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">domain, </span>a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>another private <span class="gemarra-regular">domain.</span>
The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, stores, </span>this proves <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that we are dealing with a threshold </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as it would otherwise be prohibited to transfer the key from the threshold to the lock. If so, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this lock, what are the circumstances? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If there is not </span>an area of <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>by four handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">in it, </span>it does not have the status of a prohibited domain at all, and <span class="gemarra-regular">it is an exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> domain.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is four </span>by four handbreadths, and therefore a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">would the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say in that </span>case: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even when the lock is above</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ten handbreadths </span>off the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">bring a key</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat eve and place it in the threshold, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the following day he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">open and close </span>the door <span class="gemarra-regular">and return </span>the key <span class="gemarra-regular">to the threshold or to a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> window above the door? Isn’t he moving </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">from a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the private domain?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Actually, </span>the lock <span class="gemarra-regular">is not four </span>by four handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">but there is </span>enough space in the door surrounding it <span class="gemarra-regular">to carve out </span>a hole that would <span class="gemarra-regular">complete </span>its area to the requisite <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And this is </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute: Rabbi Meir, </span>who conforms to his standard line of reasoning, <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> carves out </span>the space <span class="gemarra-regular">to complete </span>it to four handbreadths. In other words, if a small opening is located in a place large enough for it to be widened, the place is viewed as though it had already been carved out, providing the opening with the larger dimensions. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis </span>conform to their standard line of reasoning, as they <span class="gemarra-regular">maintain </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not carve out </span>the space <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> complete </span>it to four handbreadths. Consequently, the lock in its present condition is not large enough to constitute a place of significance, and it is therefore regarded as an exempt place.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai bar Abaye said: Learn from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> three </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from it </span>that according to Rabbi Meir, <span class="gemarra-regular">we carve out to complet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the necessary dimensions. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from it </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir retracted </span>his ruling with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">garden gates. </span>According to Rava, Rabbi Meir prohibited a man standing in a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span> from opening a door in a private domain, and yet here he permits a similar case. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And learn from </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>that the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Dimi is accepted. As when Rav Dimi came </span>to Babylonia from Eretz Israel, he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>with an area <span class="gemarra-regular">that is less than four by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths and that is set apart from the surrounding area is an exempt domain with regard to carrying on Shabbat. Consequently, if the domain is located between a public domain and a private domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted for </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">the people in the public domain and for the people </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the private domain to adjust </span>the burden <span class="gemarra-regular">onto their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shoulders, provided that they do not exchange </span>objects with one another. This ruling, that it is prohibited to exchange articles, is supported by the position of the Rabbis that it is prohibited to transfer the key from the threshold, which is a <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, via the lock, an exempt domain, to the private domain of the window, as one may not transfer an object from one prohibited domain to another, even via an exempt domain.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a bolt </span>that secures a door in place and <span class="gemarra-regular">that has </span>a thick <span class="gemarra-regular">knob </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gelustera</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">at its end</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a useful implement for a variety of purposes, the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> disagree whether the bolt has the status of a vessel, and one may therefore close the door with it, or whether it is considered a cross beam, which would mean that doing so is classified as building. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer prohibits </span>its use, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yosei permits </span>it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer said: An incident </span>occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">in a synagogue</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Tiberias</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, where they were accustomed </span>to treat use of this bolt as <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted, until Rabban Gamliel and the Elders</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> came and prohibited </span>it to <span class="gemarra-regular">them. Rabbi Yosei says </span>that the opposite was the case: At first <span class="gemarra-regular">they were accustomed</span> to treat use of this bolt as <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, and Rabban</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Gamliel and the Elders came and permitted </span>it to <span class="gemarra-regular">them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara narrows the dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the bolt <span class="gemarra-regular">can</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be moved by the rope </span>with which it is attached to the door, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that it is considered part of the door, and one may secure the door with it. <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Eliezer <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree,</span> 

Daf 102a

it is<span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it cannot be picked up by its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rope, </span>as it is too thin to bear the weight of the bolt. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yosei, <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains: Since </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it has a knob at its end, it has the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">status of a vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and one is therefore permitted to secure the door with it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Eliezer, <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains: Since it cannot be picked up by its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rope, no, </span>it is not considered a proper vessel merely because of the knob, and consequently, its use is prohibited on Shabbat.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a bolt that </span>is attached to the door, but owing to the length of the rope, it does not hang from the door but <span class="gemarra-regular">drag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> along the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">lock </span>a door <span class="gemarra-regular">with it in the Temple </span>on Shabbat, as this is prohibited only by rabbinic decree, issued to enhance the character of Shabbat as a day of rest, and rabbinic decrees are not in effect in the Temple. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>lock a door with this bolt <span class="gemarra-regular">in the country</span> outside the Temple. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one that </span>is not tied at all but <span class="gemarra-regular">rests </span>entirely on the ground, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited in both </span>places, in and outside the Temple, as the use of this bolt is considered building. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda says: One that rests </span>entirely on the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted in the Temple, and one that drags </span>along the ground is permitted even <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the country</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Which is the bolt</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that drags </span>along the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">with which one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">lock</span> a door on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Temple but not in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>rest of the <span class="gemarra-regular">country? Any that is tied </span>to the door <span class="gemarra-regular">and suspended </span>from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">while one end </span>of the bolt <span class="gemarra-regular">reaches the ground. Rabbi Yehuda says: This </span>type of bolt <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted even in </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> country. Rather, which is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bolt with which one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">lock </span>a door <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Temple but not in </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the country? Any that is neither tied </span>to the door <span class="gemarra-regular">nor suspended </span>from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">but which one removes</span> after use <span class="gemarra-regular">and places in a corner.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda with regard to</span> a bolt <span class="gemarra-regular">that is dragged</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> It is permitted to use this bolt on Shabbat even outside the Temple, but it is prohibited to use a bolt that rests on the ground, even in the Temple.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: And that is </span>the case only <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the bolt <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tied to the door </span>itself. The Gemara is surprised by this ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">so? But didn’t Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Tavla happen </span>to come <span class="gemarra-regular">to Meḥoza and he saw a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> certain </span>bolt <span class="gemarra-regular">that was suspended from the side of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> door, and he did not say anything to </span>the people there with regard to a prohibition? The Gemara rejects this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>bolt <span class="gemarra-regular">was one that could be picked up</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by its rope. </span>Everyone agrees that a bolt of this kind may be used for locking a door on Shabbat even if it is not tied to the door itself.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Avya </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">happened </span>to come <span class="gemarra-regular">to Neharde’a </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">saw a certain</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person tying </span>a bolt to a door <span class="gemarra-regular">with a reed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. He said: This </span>door may <span class="gemarra-regular">not be locked </span>on Shabbat, as the bolt is not adequately fastened to it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Zeira raised </span>the following <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: </span>If the bolt <span class="gemarra-regular">was presse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> into the ground through a hole in the threshold, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is the use of this bolt considered building? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: What is </span>Rabbi Zeira’s <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma? </span>Has <span class="gemarra-regular">he not heard that which was taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: If the bolt <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>altogether <span class="gemarra-regular">detached </span>from the rope to which it had been tied, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited; </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">if it was pressed </span>into the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted; and Rabbi Yehuda said: </span>If it <span class="gemarra-regular">was pressed</span> into the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though it was not </span>entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">detached</span> from its rope, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda with regard to </span>a bolt <span class="gemarra-regular">that was pressed </span>into the ground. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is the reason </span>that the Sages prohibited the use of a bolt <span class="gemarra-regular">that was pressed </span>into the ground? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>They prohibited its use <span class="gemarra-regular">because it appears like building</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as the bolt enters all the way into the ground.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Neḥumei</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Zekharya raised a dilemma before Abaye: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one produced</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a handle for </span>the bolt in order to hold it, but it was not tied to the door, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: A pestle, you say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>If it has a handle it is a proper utensil, which may be freely used according to all opinions. This teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>also in the form of a direct statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Neḥumei bar Adda said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he produced a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handle for </span>the bolt, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted.</span>
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">there was a certain </span>cross <span class="gemarra-regular">bea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">house of Rabbi Pedat that </span>was so heavy it took <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">to lift it, and they would place it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">against the door </span>at night in order to secure it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Pedat <span class="gemarra-regular">did not say anything to them </span>with regard to a possible prohibition. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said: </span>I permit it because <span class="gemarra-regular">it has the status of a utensil. </span>It appears like a utensil and it serves a distinct purpose; therefore, it may be used on Shabbat.
The Gemara further relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">there was a certain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mortar in the house of Mar Shmuel that had a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">capacity of an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">adriva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is equal to half a <span class="it-text">kor</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Shmuel permitted </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">to place it against</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the door </span>to secure it. He <span class="gemarra-regular">said: It </span>falls into the halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">category of a utensil, </span>and it may therefore be used to secure the door, as this is not regarded as building. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ye</span><span class="gemarra-regular">ḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">ezkel sent </span>a request <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Amram: Let the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Master tell us </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">of those outstanding matters that you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> told us in the name of Rav Asi </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the arches of a boa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> upon which mats are draped as protection against the elements. Rav Amram <span class="gemarra-regular">sent</span> back <span class="gemarra-regular">to him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi said as follows: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the arches of a boat, when they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a handbreadth </span>wide, or <span class="gemarra-regular">even if they are not a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handbreadth </span>wide <span class="gemarra-regular">but there is less than three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them, </span>in which case the intervening space is regarded as filled in based on the principle of <span class="it-text">lavud</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> following day, </span>i.e., on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">bring a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mat and spread </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">over them.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this leniency? The reason is that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">adding to a temporary</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tent, </span>and therefore one may <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>spread a mat over the arches. They themselves constitute a tent. Therefore, one who spreads a mat over them is merely adding to the temporary tent. 
The Gemara further relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna had</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> certain rams that required shade during the day and required</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> air at night. </span>He therefore sought a way for the pen to be covered by day but not at night, even on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">He came before Rav </span>to seek his advice. 
Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Go, roll</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> up </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">mats [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">budeya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> that were spread out there for shade, but <span class="gemarra-regular">leave </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">handbreadth </span>covered. <span class="gemarra-regular">On the following</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day, unroll </span>the entire mat, which is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">adding to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a temporary tent </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">which is permitted. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said in the name</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi Ḥiyya: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a curtain </span>put up for privacy, <span class="gemarra-regular">one is permitted to spread it out, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to dismantle it on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> As it is not a tent but merely a temporary wall, akin to a door, one does not violate a prohibition if it is not fixed firmly in place. 
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a bridal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> canopy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a curtain that is suspended over a bed and inclines outward in both directions, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">to dismantle it and to spread it on Shabbat. Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, said: We said </span>that this is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">only where </span>the curtain extends over the bed and falls on both sides in such a manner that <span class="gemarra-regular">the top </span>of the curtain, the apex of the canopy, <span class="gemarra-regular">is less than a handbreadth </span>wide. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">top is a handbreadth </span>wide, i.e., if the curtain does not rise to a sharp point but extends horizontally for a handbreadth, after which it falls to the side, this handbreadth is regarded as a tent and is therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">where its </span>horizontal <span class="gemarra-regular">top is not a handbreadth </span>wide, <span class="gemarra-regular">we said </span>this leniency <span class="gemarra-regular">only if </span>its width <span class="gemarra-regular">is less </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than a handbreadth within three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">top. However, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>its width <span class="gemarra-regular">is a handbreadth within three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">top, </span>this handbreadth is considered a tent and it is therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to spread it on Shabbat. 
And even <span class="gemarra-regular">where it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is less than a handbreadth </span>wide <span class="gemarra-regular">within three </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span> its <span class="gemarra-regular">top, we said </span>this leniency <span class="gemarra-regular">only where </span>

<span class="gemarra-regular">its incline does not extend</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a handbreadth </span>from the center to each side. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its incline extends a handbreadth </span>from the center to the side, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the inclines of tents are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> considered like tents, </span>and it is therefore prohibited to suspend them. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said: </span>With regard to a stiff <span class="gemarra-regular">felt hat [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sayna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted </span>to wear it on Shabbat. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that wearing this hat <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited? </span>The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which prohibits wearing a felt hat, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the hat extends <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handbreadth </span>from the person’s head and is therefore regarded as a tent; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>statement by Rav Sheisha, who permits doing so, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not </span>extend <span class="gemarra-regular">a handbreadth </span>from one’s head. 
The Gemara is surprised at this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if that is so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">pulled his cloak a handbreadth </span>beyond his head, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it also prohibited </span>for him to do so? This is unreasonable, as it is an article of clothing, not a tent. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the previous explanation must be rejected, as the issue with regard to a felt hat is not whether it is considered a tent, but whether there is concern that one might come to carry it in the public domain if it falls from his head. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult; this </span>statement of Rav Sheisha, which permits it, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the hat <span class="gemarra-regular">fits snugl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> on his head. There is no concern lest the hat fall and one will come to carry it; therefore it is permitted to wear it. Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which prohibits wearing this hat, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it does not fit snugly</span> on his head. It is therefore liable to fall, and one might come to carry it in the public domain.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">restore </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">lower hinge pin </span>of the door of a carriage, box, or cupboard that becomes dislocated to its place on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Temple, </span>as this action is prohibited by rabbinic decree, which is not in effect in the Temple; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>it may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be restored to its place <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the country. And </span>restoring <span class="gemarra-regular">the upper </span>hinge pin <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited in both </span>places, as this is considered building, a labor prohibited by Torah law, which applies everywhere. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>Restoring <span class="gemarra-regular">the upper </span>hinge pin to its place is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Temple, while </span>one may restore <span class="gemarra-regular">the lower one </span>to its place even <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the country.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sages taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to the lower <span class="gemarra-regular">hinge </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pin of the door of a carriage, box, or cupboard, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">restore </span>it to its place <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Temple; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span>rest of the <span class="gemarra-regular">country one </span>may only push it <span class="gemarra-regular">back </span>into place, provided that it did not come out of its socket entirely. As for <span class="gemarra-regular">the upper </span>hinge, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not restore </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in either </span>place. This is prohibited as <span class="gemarra-regular">a preventive measure, lest </span>one come to <span class="gemarra-regular">bang </span>it in forcefully, thereby performing an actual labor prohibited by Torah law. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">banged </span>it in, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering, </span>as his action is considered building.
With regard to the hinge pin of the door of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pit, cistern, or an extension </span>to a building, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not restore </span>it to its place at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">restored </span>it to its place, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The above distinction applies only to movable utensils, whereas anything attached to the ground may certainly not be fixed in place, as this is regarded as prohibited building.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">return </span>to its place <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bandage </span>that became detached from a wound on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Temple. </span>In the Temple, this is not prohibited as a preventive measure, lest one come to spread the ointment and thereby perform the prohibited labor of smoothing. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>return a bandage to its place <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the country. If </span>one sought to apply the bandage <span class="gemarra-regular">for the first time </span>to an untreated wound on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited in both </span>places.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to a <span class="gemarra-regular">bandage that became </span><span class="gemarra-regular">detached from a wound, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">return </span>it to its place <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat </span>in all cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">it slipped downward, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">push it upward; </span>if it slipped <span class="gemarra-regular">upward, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">push it </span>downward. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may also <span class="gemarra-regular">uncover part of the bandage and clean the opening of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the wound </span>on one side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and then uncover another part</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the bandage </span>on the other side <span class="gemarra-regular">and clean the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> opening of the wound </span>on that side.
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clean the bandage itself, because </span>that would involve <span class="gemarra-regular">spreading </span>the ointment, which is a subcategory of the prohibited labor of smoothing, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if one spread </span>the ointment <span class="gemarra-regular">he is liable</span> to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering. </span>Actually restoring a bandage that was completely detached from the wound is prohibited in all cases. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda. Rav Ḥisda said: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>that it is permitted to restore the bandage to the wound <span class="gemarra-regular">only where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it became detached </span>and fell <span class="gemarra-regular">onto a utensil, </span>in which case one may immediately pick it up and replace it. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it became detached </span>and fell <span class="gemarra-regular">onto the ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, everyone agrees it is prohibited, </span>as this is considered as though one were bandaging the wound for the first time. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar bar Rav Ashi said: I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was standing before Father, </span>and his bandage <span class="gemarra-regular">fell onto a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pillow and he replaced it. I said to him: Doesn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t the Master hold that which Rav Ḥisda said: The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dispute </span>is restricted to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the bandage <span class="gemarra-regular">became</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> detached </span>and fell <span class="gemarra-regular">onto a utensil, but if it became</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> detached </span>and fell <span class="gemarra-regular">onto the ground, </span>everyone agrees that <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is prohibited; and </span>furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>that it is prohibited to replace even a bandage that fell onto a utensil?
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said to me: I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not hear this </span>teaching; <span class="gemarra-regular">that is to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say, I do not agree </span>with Rav Ḥisda’s interpretation that the dispute is only in a case where the bandage fell onto a utensil. Rather, they disagree even if it fell onto the ground, and the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that the bandage may be restored to the wound. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">tie up </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">a string [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nima</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> that came loose from a harp used <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Temple</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not in </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the country. And </span>tying the string to the harp for <span class="gemarra-regular">the first time is prohibited</span> both <span class="gemarra-regular">here and there.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a harp string broke, one would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not tie it up </span>with a knot, <span class="gemarra-regular">but fashion a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bow. </span>This teaching indicates that tying up a harp string is prohibited even in the Temple. The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult; this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which prohibits tying, was taught <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis; and that </span>mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer. </span>
The Gemara clarifies this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Rabbi Eliezer, who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the preparations </span>that enable the performance <span class="gemarra-regular">of a mitzva override </span>the prohibitions of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">tie </span>even the broken harp string, as this is for the purpose of the mitzva of accompanying the Temple service with music. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis, who say </span>that preparations for a mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> override </span>Shabbat prohibitions, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may only <span class="gemarra-regular">fashion a bow. </span>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>in fact the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eliezer, </span>who permits facilitating performance of a mitzva even when it involves desecration of Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in a case where the string did not break and one is tying it <span class="gemarra-regular">for the first time, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">too </span>should be permitted, as he is acting for the purpose of a mitzva.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Gemara provides a different resolution of the contradiction: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This, </span>the mishna that permits tying the broken string, was taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who maintains that making a bow is considered tying, and there is no difference between the two actions; <span class="gemarra-regular">and that, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that prohibits it, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who rule that fashioning a bow is not prohibited by Torah law, and therefore it is permitted to fashion a bow. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda, in accordance with whose </span>opinion did he express his view? 

Daf 103a

<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he stated his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Eliezer, </span>why did he permit tying a bow only after the fact? It should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as Rabbi Eliezer maintains that preparations required for the performance of a mitzva override the prohibitions of Shabbat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Gemara rejects the previous explanation: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">difficult; this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that deems tying prohibited is according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>mishna that rules that tying is permitted, is according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a string of the Levite’s harp was severed </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">tie it </span>with a knot; <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: He </span>may only <span class="gemarra-regular">form a bow. </span>The Rabbis permit the preparations for a mitzva that could not have been performed before Shabbat, whereas Rabbi Shimon is stringent and prohibits even those preparations.
The Gemara continues its citation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Even </span>if he ties a knot or a bow, the harp <span class="gemarra-regular">will not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">issue the </span>proper <span class="gemarra-regular">sound, </span>and he would therefore be committing a transgression without performing the mitzva in a fitting manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, he unwinds </span>the string <span class="gemarra-regular">from the lower </span>knob and <span class="gemarra-regular">winds it around the upper </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">or he unwinds </span>the string <span class="gemarra-regular">from the upper </span>knob <span class="gemarra-regular">and winds it around the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lower </span>one, before tightening the string until it produces the proper note. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>sources were taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who permit preparations for a mitzva that could not have been performed the day before, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>even so it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult; here, </span>the mishna permits tying in a case where the string was severed <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle, </span>in which case the sound would be affected if the string were reconnected with a bow, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a string that was severed <span class="gemarra-regular">on the sid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> near the end of the string, which can be fixed with a bow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>sources are referring to a case where the string snapped <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle, </span>and the issue at hand is subject to a dispute between Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis: <span class="gemarra-regular">One Sage, </span>Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that it is prohibited even to tie a knot in the middle, <span class="gemarra-regular">as a decree, </span>lest one unnecessarily tie a knot on the side as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not issue a decree </span>of this kind. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A wart is an example of a blemish that temporarily disqualifies a priest from performing the Temple service, and disqualifies an animal from being offered on the altar; they regain their fitness once the wart is removed. Consequently, on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">cut</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> off a war</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> by hand <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Temple, </span>as this constitutes a preparatory act required for the sacrificial service. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>he may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>cut off a wart <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the country. And if </span>he seeks to cut off the wart <span class="gemarra-regular">with an instrument, it is prohibited in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> both </span>places.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a contradiction </span>from another mishna: When Passover eve occurs on Shabbat, the acts of <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying </span>a Paschal lamb on one’s shoulders, <span class="gemarra-regular">bringing it </span>to the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">from outside</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and cutting off its wart </span>to render it fit for the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not override </span>the prohibitions of Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, </span>conforming to his standard opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">says: They override </span>the Shabbat prohibitions. The mishna in <span class="it-text">Eiruvin</span> apparently contradicts the opinion of these Sages.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥanina </span>suggested different resolutions to this difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">One said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>sources are referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a moist </span>wart, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the mishna permits removing the wart <span class="gemarra-regular">by hand. </span>It is prohibited by rabbinic decree, as that is not the usual manner of performing the procedure. Whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the mishna prohibits removal of the wart <span class="gemarra-regular">with an instrument </span>by Torah law. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one said </span>that in <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>cases the wart is removed <span class="gemarra-regular">by hand, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. There, </span>the mishna prohibits the removal of <span class="gemarra-regular">a moist </span>wart, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>the mishna is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a dry </span>wart, the removal of which does not constitute a prohibited labor.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the one who said: This </span>is referring to removal <span class="gemarra-regular">by hand, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is referring to removal <span class="gemarra-regular">with an instrument; what is the reason that he did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not say, </span>as did his colleague: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a moist </span>wart and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is referring to a <span class="gemarra-regular">dry</span> one? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you </span>that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a dry </span>wart, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted </span>to remove it <span class="gemarra-regular">even with an instrument. What is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reason? </span>As <span class="gemarra-regular">it crumbles </span>on its own, cutting it is like cutting off dead skin.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one who said: This </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a moist </span>wart and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a dry </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the reason that he did not say, </span>like the other Sage: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is referring to removal <span class="gemarra-regular">by hand </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> is referring to removal <span class="gemarra-regular">with an instrument? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> instrument, we </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he wishes to cut off the wart <span class="gemarra-regular">with an instrument, it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited in both </span>places. Consequently, it is unnecessary to teach again that it is prohibited to remove a wart with an instrument. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the other </span>Sage, how does he respond to this contention? He can say that the other mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">there because it wants</span> to record <span class="gemarra-regular">the dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis</span> on this issue, i.e., to inform us that Rabbi Eliezer disagrees and permits cutting off the wart even with an instrument. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the other</span> Sage, how does he counter this reasoning? He can say that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the case of the wart <span class="gemarra-regular">parallel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and bringing it</span> to the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">from outside the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundary, </span>activities <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are </span>prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law. </span>Consequently, the ruling involving a wart is also referring to cutting that is prohibited by rabbinic law, i.e., cutting by hand, not with an instrument. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the other</span> Sage maintains that these cases also involve Torah prohibitions. How so? With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying </span>the animal, the mishna was taught <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who said: A living being carries itself, </span>which means that carrying an animal on one’s shoulders is not considered carrying by Torah law, and is prohibited by rabbinic law. If we do not accept this opinion, one who carries the Paschal lamb transgresses the Torah prohibition against carrying an object four cubits in the public domain. As for the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">bringing </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">from outside the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundary, </span>the mishna was taught <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, who said: </span>Bringing an animal from outside the Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundaries </span>is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef raised an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">objection </span>against this explanation from a mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer said </span>that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inference: If slaughtering </span>the Paschal lamb, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is </span>prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a prohibited labor </span>by Torah law, nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">overrides Shabbat </span>in the Temple, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>actions, i.e., carrying the animal, bringing it from outside the Shabbat boundary, and cutting off its wart, which are prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">due to rabbinic decree, isn’t it right that they </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">override Shabbat? </span>Evidently, the previous explanation must be rejected, as there too the mishna is referring to rabbinic prohibitions.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Yosef said: Both </span>sources are referring to a case where the wart is removed <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hand, </span>an activity that constitutes a rabbinic prohibition, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the contradiction can be resolved as follows: To transgress <span class="gemarra-regular">a rabbinic</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> decree </span>relating to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Temple within </span>the confines of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Temple </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">they permitted </span>doing so. However, to transgress <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rabbinic decree </span>relating <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Temple, in the country, they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not permit </span>doing so. Consequently, although these procedures involving the Paschal lamb are prohibited due to rabbinic decree and are indeed related to the Temple service, since they are performed outside the Temple, the Sages did not permit their performance.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye sat </span>with the scholars <span class="gemarra-regular">and recited </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> in the name of Rav Yosef. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Safra </span><span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span>the opinion cited by <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span>from a mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one was reading a scroll </span>of the Bible while sitting <span class="gemarra-regular">on the threshold </span>of his house, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the scroll rolled out of his hand, </span>i.e., while he was holding one end, the scroll rolled open into the public domain, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">roll </span>the scroll back <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">himself. And here, isn’t it a rabbinic decree </span>involving a sacred scroll, which due to its sanctity should have the legal status of a rabbinic decree relating <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Temple </span>with regard to an incident that occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">country. And </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not issue a decree </span>prohibiting one to roll the scroll back to himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span>the scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">fall and he will </span>forget and <span class="gemarra-regular">come to bring </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it in </span>from the public domain to a private domain. Apparently, the Sages did not impose a rabbinic prohibition with regard to matters relating to the Temple, even outside the Temple compound.
Abaye refutes this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span>this mishna as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a threshold </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karmelit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>e.g., one that is four handbreadths wide but less than ten handbreadths high, <span class="gemarra-regular">and before which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the public domain passes? As he holds </span>one end of the scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">in his hand, it is not </span>prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span> by <span class="gemarra-regular">rabbinic decree. </span>The reason is that even if the scroll fell from his hand and rolled into the public domain, and he were to carry it back from the public domain to the <span class="it-text">karmelit</span>, he would not transgress a Torah prohibition. 
Rav Safra <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection </span>from a different mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">lower the Paschal </span>lamb<span class="gemarra-regular"> into the ove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> on Shabbat eve <span class="gemarra-regular">just before nightfall, </span>after its blood is sprinkled and it is brought outside the Temple for roasting. <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here </span>we are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a violation of <span class="gemarra-regular">a rabbinic</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> decree </span>relating <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Temple </span>that occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">in the country</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and yet <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not issue </span>a decree against lowering the sacrifice into the oven at that late hour <span class="gemarra-regular">lest</span> one <span class="gemarra-regular">rake the coals </span>to hasten the cooking. Once again, the mishna indicates that the Sages did not issue a rabbinic decree prohibiting an action related to the Temple service, even outside the Temple.
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">was silent </span>and did not answer. <span class="gemarra-regular">When he came before Rav Yosef, he said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: This is what Rav Safra said to me, </span>contrary to your approach. Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">you didn’t answer him: Members </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a group </span>who joined together to prepare and partake of a single Paschal lamb, which, like all sacrifices, requires careful attention, <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">vigilan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and exacting in the performance of this mitzva. Consequently, there is less concern that they might commit a transgression than with regard to people in other circumstances. However, other rabbinic decrees relating to the Temple remain in effect outside the Temple.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> as for <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye, </span>why did he not accept this reasoning? He maintains that <span class="gemarra-regular">we say </span>that only <span class="gemarra-regular">priests are vigilant</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as they are constantly involved in the Temple service, and they will therefore not mistakenly commit a transgression. However, that <span class="gemarra-regular">members of a group of people </span>who join together for a single Paschal lamb <span class="gemarra-regular">are vigilant, we do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say. </span>As they are not accustomed to that level of watchfulness, they might forget.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava stated </span>a different resolution of the contradiction between the two <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span>: The mishna which permits the cutting of a wart, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eliezer, who said </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">preparations </span>for the performance <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a mitzva override </span>the prohibitions of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span>and it is therefore permitted to cut the wart by hand. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if you say that in that case one should be permitted to do so with an instrument as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> concedes </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">as much as it is possible to alter</span> the manner in which a procedure is performed to prevent violation of a Torah prohibition, <span class="gemarra-regular">we alter </span>it, to emphasize that the day is Shabbat. 

Daf 103b

<span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the source for this idea? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">priest grew a wart, </span>which temporarily disqualifies him from performing the service, <span class="gemarra-regular">his fellow </span>priest may <span class="gemarra-regular">cut it off for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">with his teeth. </span>The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his teeth, yes, </span>this is permitted; but <span class="gemarra-regular">with an instrument, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>he may not do so. Likewise, for <span class="gemarra-regular">his fellow</span> priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>he may cut off his wart; but <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>he may not cut off his own wart. 
The Gemara inquires: According to <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion was this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> taught? <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, and </span>the leniency is based on the principle that a rabbinic prohibition does not apply <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Temple, since the Rabbis say in general </span>that biting off even one’s own nails or wart, and certainly those of another, is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">due to rabbinic decree, </span>then in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">here, what is </span>the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>whether it is the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">himself </span>who cuts off the wart, or <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>whether it is <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>priest who cuts it off? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, wasn’t </span>it taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> general </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable to </span>bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering </span>for biting off his own nails or wart? <span class="gemarra-regular">And here, even</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> though </span>he maintains that <span class="gemarra-regular">preparations </span>for a <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva override </span>the prohibitions of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span>and it should therefore be permitted for him to cut off his own wart with an instrument, nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">as much as it is possible to alter </span>the procedure so that it does not entail the violation of a Torah prohibition, <span class="gemarra-regular">one alters, </span>and biting off another person’s wart is prohibited due to rabbinic decree, not Torah law. 
The Gemara rejects this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this is not necessarily the case. <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> can be explained in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if </span>the wart <span class="gemarra-regular">grew</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on his abdomen, </span>or anywhere else easily removable by hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>it is clear that according to the Rabbis there is no difference between himself and his fellow priest, and he may remove it himself.
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, we are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where, </span>the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">received a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bite </span>that developed into a wart <span class="gemarra-regular">on his bac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on his elbow, </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">where he </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot remove it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>but someone else can. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if</span> the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> reflects the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>the other priest should be permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">remove </span>the wart <span class="gemarra-regular">from him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by hand, </span>rather than with an instrument, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore one should <span class="gemarra-regular">resolve </span>the dilemma in accordance with the teaching of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar said: The dispute </span>between the Rabbis and Rabbi Eliezer with regard to the removal of one’s nails is limited to one who removed them <span class="gemarra-regular">by hand, but </span>if he removed them <span class="gemarra-regular">with an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">instrument, everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is liable </span>to bring a sin-offering.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to your reasoning, Rabbi Eliezer </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>agree <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>should be permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">remove it for him by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hand. </span>The Gemara expresses surprise at this comment: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the nature of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>contention? <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that it was taught in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, this is</span> why removing the wart <span class="gemarra-regular">by hand was decreed </span>prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">due</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>a preventive measure, lest he remove it with <span class="gemarra-regular">an instrument, </span>as he maintains that removing a wart with an instrument is prohibited by the Torah. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say it </span>is according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>should be permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">remove it for him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by hand. And nothing more </span>need be said, as it is clear that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> was taught in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a priest who was injured on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his finger </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may temporarily <span class="gemarra-regular">wrap it with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a ree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> so that his wound is not visible while he is serving in the Temple. This leniency applies <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Temple, but not in the country, </span>as it also heals the wound, and medical treatment is prohibited on Shabbat due to rabbinic decree. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>his intention <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to draw blood </span>from the wound or to absorb blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited in both </span>places.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, said: They taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">only a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reed </span>is permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, a small sash is </span>prohibited, as it would be <span class="gemarra-regular">considered an extra garment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and it is prohibited for a priest to add to the priestly garments prescribed by the Torah.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: They said </span>that donning an <span class="gemarra-regular">extra garment </span>is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if it is worn <span class="gemarra-regular">in a place </span>on the priest’s body where the priestly <span class="gemarra-regular">garments </span>are worn. <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a place </span>where those <span class="gemarra-regular">garments </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>worn, e.g., on his hand or the like, a sash that is tied there <span class="gemarra-regular">is not considered an extra garment.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let him derive </span>that both the reed and the sash are prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">as an interposition. </span>As the reed and sash interpose between the priest’s hand and the holy vessel, they should invalidate the service. The Gemara rejects this contention: Perhaps the wound is <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">left </span>hand, while the entire service is performed exclusively with his right hand. Consequently, a bandage on his left hand is not an interposition. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>it is possible that the wound is <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">right </span>hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not in a place </span>used in the <span class="gemarra-regular">service, </span>which means the bandage does not interpose between his hand and the holy vessels used in the Temple service. 
And this conclusion <span class="gemarra-regular">disputes </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava, as Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥisda said: In a place </span>on the priest’s body where the priestly <span class="gemarra-regular">garments </span>are worn, <span class="gemarra-regular">even one </span>extra <span class="gemarra-regular">thread interposes </span>and is prohibited, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">in a place </span>where the priestly <span class="gemarra-regular">garments </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>worn, if the fabric was <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>fingerbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">by three </span>fingerbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">it interposes, </span>but if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>fingerbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">by three </span>fingerbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">it does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not interpose.</span>
The Gemara comments: This teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly disagrees with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>as he maintains that the prohibition against interpositions does not apply at all in a place on the priest’s body where the priestly garments are not worn. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">shall we say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that it </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, </span>who prohibits even a sash smaller than three by three fingerbreadths?
The Gemara answers: Nothing can be proven from here, as <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> small sash is different, since it is significant, </span>and it is therefore considered a garment even if it is less than three by three fingerbreadths.
According to <span class="gemarra-regular">another version, they reported </span>this dispute as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they taught </span>this leniency <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a reed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a small sash interposes.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">interposition with regard to </span>an article that is <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three by three </span>fingerbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">only in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a place </span>where the priestly <span class="gemarra-regular">garments </span>are worn. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a place </span>where the priestly <span class="gemarra-regular">garments </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>worn, the following distinction applies: 

Daf 104a

If the fabric was <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>fingerbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">by three </span>fingerbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">it interposes; </span>but if it was <span class="gemarra-regular">less than three </span>fingerbreadths by three fingerbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">it does not interpose. And this is </span>the same teaching that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us say that this disagrees with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda, son of Rav Ḥisda, </span>who prohibits a sash even smaller than three fingerbreadths by three fingerbreadths. The Gemara rejects this contention: This is not necessarily so, as <span class="gemarra-regular">a small </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sash is different, since it is significant. </span>It is therefore like a garment, even if it is smaller than three fingerbreadths by three fingerbreadths. 
The Gemara raises a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Rather than teaching us </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reed, let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach us </span>that a priest may wrap his wounded finger with <span class="gemarra-regular">a small sash, </span>as that does not constitute an interposition. 
The Gemara explains: The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">matter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in passing, that a reed heals. </span>However, as far as a priest involved in the service in concerned, there is no concern with regard to this prohibition either, as it is also a rabbinic decree that is not in effect in the Temple.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">scatte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">salt </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ram</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> that leads to the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>the priests will <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">slip </span>on their way up. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>likewise, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">draw </span><span class="gemarra-regular">water from the Cistern of the Exile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Great Cistern</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which were located in the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span> means of <span class="gemarra-regular">the whee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> designed for drawing water, even <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat. And </span>one may draw water <span class="gemarra-regular">from the Heker </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Well </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">on a Festival. </span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ika from Pashronya raised a contradiction before Rava: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">scatter salt </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">on the ramp </span>that leads to the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the priests will <span class="gemarra-regular">not slip, </span>from which it can be inferred: <span class="gemarra-regular">In the Temple, yes, </span>it is permitted to do so, but outside the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the country, no, </span>it is prohibited to scatter salt on a ramp. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">raised </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">contradiction </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard that was damaged </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">by rainwater</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that it became difficult to cross, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">bring straw and scatter it about </span>to absorb the water. Apparently, an action of this kind is permitted even outside the Temple.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Straw is different, as one does not negate</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it; </span>rather, he intends to remove it once the water has been absorbed. He is therefore permitted to scatter the straw in the courtyard, just as it is permitted to put it in any other place. However, it is prohibited to scatter objects that one intends to leave in place, such as salt, as this appears as though he is adding to the ground and building.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: This</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> salt, what are the circumstances? If one negates it </span>vis-à-vis the ramp so that it becomes part of the ramp, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>effectively <span class="gemarra-regular">adds to the structur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it states </span>with regard to the Temple: <span class="gemarra-regular">“All this do I give you in writing as God</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has made me wise by His hand upon me, </span>even all the works of this pattern” (I Chronicles 28:19). This verse indicates that all the details of the Temple structure were determined through prophecy and may not be changed in any way, even on a weekday.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if he does not negate </span>the salt vis-à-vis the ramp, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">constitute an interposition </span>between the feet of the priests and the altar. This would mean that they would not be walking on the ramp during their service, and consequently they would not be performing the service as required by the Torah. 
The Gemara answers: In fact, he does not negate the salt. However, he scatters it <span class="gemarra-regular">when the limbs </span>of the sacrifice <span class="gemarra-regular">are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brought up the ramp, </span>a procedure <span class="gemarra-regular">that is not </span>considered part of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Temple service </span>subject to disqualification due to interposition, as it is merely preparation for the burning of the limbs.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is this <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>a service? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it written: “And the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> priest shall offer it whole and make it smoke upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the altar” </span>(Leviticus 1:13), <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Master said </span>in explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">bringing the limbs to </span>the top of <span class="gemarra-regular">the ramp. </span>Evidently, this too is a service written in the Torah. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say </span>that he scatters the salt <span class="gemarra-regular">when the wood is brought </span>up the ramp <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the arrangement </span>of wood on the altar, a procedure <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not a service.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">a courtyard that was damaged </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rainwater, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">bring straw and scatter it about </span>to make it easier to walk across. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rava: But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">When</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one scatters </span>the straw, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">not scatter </span>it either <span class="gemarra-regular">with a </span>small <span class="gemarra-regular">basket or with a large basket, but</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">with the bottom of a </span>broken <span class="gemarra-regular">basket, </span>i.e., he must scatter the straw in a manner different from that of an ordinary weekday. Rava, however, indicates that he may scatter the straw in the usual fashion. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava then appointed an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">amora</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before him </span>to publicize his teaching, <span class="gemarra-regular">and taught: The statement I issued before you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was a mistake of mine. However, </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">they said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the name of Rabbi Eliezer as follows: And when</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one scatters </span>the straw, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">not scatter </span>it either <span class="gemarra-regular">with a </span>small <span class="gemarra-regular">basket or with a large basket, but</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">with the bottom of a </span>broken <span class="gemarra-regular">basket.</span>
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">draw water from the Cistern of the Exiles </span>by means of a wheel. The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla happened </span>to come <span class="gemarra-regular">to the house of Rav Menashe </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">man came and knocked at the door. </span>Ulla <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is that? May his body be desecrated, as he desecrates</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> by producing a sound.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said to him: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>pleasant <span class="gemarra-regular">musical sound </span>on Shabbat, not the rasping sound of knocking on a door. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised an objection</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>Rabba from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">draw up </span>wine from a barrel <span class="gemarra-regular">with a siphon [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">diyofei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one</span> may <span class="gemarra-regular">drip </span>water from a vessel that releases water in drops [<span class="gemarra-italic">miarak</span>], <span class="gemarra-regular">for an ill </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat. </span>
The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">For an ill </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>this is permitted, but <span class="gemarra-regular">for a healthy </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>one may not do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what are the circumstances? </span>Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is dozing off and they wish to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> waken him, </span>and as they do not want to alarm him due to his illness, they do it by means of the sound of water poured from a vessel? <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> one can <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from here </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> produce a sound </span>on Shabbat, even one that is unpleasant, as the Sages permitted this only for an ill person. 
The Gemara rejects this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is referring to an ill person <span class="gemarra-regular">who is awake and whom</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they want to have fall asleep, </span>and to this end they let water fall in drops, producing <span class="gemarra-regular">a sound that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is heard as melodious. </span>
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">raised </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">objection to </span>Rabba from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who is guarding his produc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from birds or his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gourds from beasts </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">guard </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">manner </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>typically does so, <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat, </span>as his guarding does not entail a prohibited labor, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that he neither claps</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, nor slaps </span>his hands against his body, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor dances </span>and produces noise with his feet, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the manner that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> performed on weekdays </span>to chase away birds and animals. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the reason </span>that these activities are prohibited? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not because he is producing a sound </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> any production of a sound is prohibited? Rav Aḥa bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ya’akov said: </span>This is not the reason. Rather, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree </span>issued by the Sages, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span>while acting in his usual weekday fashion <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>mistakenly <span class="gemarra-regular">picks up a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pebble </span>to throw at the birds, thereby handling an object that is set-aside.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: Women who play</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with nut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> by rolling them on the ground until they collide with each other, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for them to do so; <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>for this prohibition? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not because </span>knocking nuts together <span class="gemarra-regular">produces a sound</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and any production of a sound is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
The Gemara rejects this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is prohibited because <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will come to level the holes. </span>As small holes in the ground will interfere with their game, they might level them out and seal them up on Shabbat, which is prohibited as building.
<span class="gemarra-regular">For</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if you do not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is the reason, there is a difficulty with <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Women who play with apples, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as <span class="gemarra-regular">what production of a sound is involved there? </span>Apples do not produce a sound when they collide with each other. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the reason is that <span class="gemarra-regular">they will perhaps come to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> level holes, </span>and the same reasoning applies to nuts.
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">draw</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> water from the Cistern of the Exiles and from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Great Cistern by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">the wheel on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> From this it can be inferred: <span class="gemarra-regular">In the Temple, yes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is permitted to do so; but outside the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the country, no, </span>it is prohibited to draw water from cisterns. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not because he is producing a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sound, and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>on Shabbat?
The Gemara again rejects this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>issued by the Sages, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest he draw </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his garden and for his ruin. </span>As the wheel draws up large quantities of water, once he starts to use it, he might draw water for his garden as well and thereby transgress the prohibition against watering on Shabbat, a subcategory of a prohibited labor.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar permitted </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">draw </span>water on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a wheel in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Meḥoza, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: What is the reason the Sages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">decreed </span>that this is prohibited? They did so <span class="gemarra-regular">lest one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">draw </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">for his garden and for his ruin. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>in Meḥoza <span class="gemarra-regular">there are neither gardens nor ruins. </span>Meḥoza was entirely built up and lacked gardens or empty areas for sowing, and consequently, there was no concern that people might transgress.
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">once he saw that </span>

Daf 104b

<span class="gemarra-regular">they were soaking flax </span>in the water, <span class="gemarra-regular">he prohibited them </span>from drawing water by means of a wheel, so that they should not draw water for prohibited purposes. 
We learned in the mishna that water may be drawn on a Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">from the Heker</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Well. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the Heker Well? Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a cistern with regard to which they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> advanced </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">hikru</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">arguments and permitted </span>drawing water from <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>on a Festival, by proving that the Torah permits doing so. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">They did not permit all Heker wells, but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only this one. And if you say </span>it was named because it is a cistern <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to which they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> put forward arguments </span>and permitted it, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the meaning of Heker wells in the plural, and what does <span class="gemarra-regular">only this one </span>mean? If it was named because of a particular announcement, how could other wells, about which no announcement was issued, bear the same name? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>The term Heker well denotes <span class="gemarra-regular">a well of living water, as it is stated: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">As a well keeps its water fresh </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">hakir</span>], so she keeps fresh her wickedness” (Jeremiah 6:7), i.e., it is a well of spring water.
Returning to <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter itself, </span>the Gemara cites the above <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in full: <span class="gemarra-regular">They did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permit all Heker wells, but only this one. And when</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the exiles ascended </span>from Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">they encamped by it, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the prophets among them, </span>Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to them. And it was not </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">the prophets </span><span class="gemarra-regular">among them </span>who permitted them to draw water from this well on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>rather, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">a customary </span><span class="gemarra-regular">practic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that was handed down <span class="gemarra-regular">to them from their forefathers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a practice the prophets permitted them to continue. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to the carcass of <span class="gemarra-regular">a creeping animal, </span>of one of the eight species of reptile or rodent listed in Leviticus 11:29–30, one of the primary sources of ritual impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">that is found in the Temple</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">priest </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">carry it out </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">in his girdle,</span> which was one of the priestly garments. Although the girdle will be defiled by the carcass of the creeping animal, this is the best way to proceed, <span class="gemarra-regular">so as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not to delay </span>the removal of <span class="gemarra-regular">the impurity </span>from the Temple. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>The creeping animal carcass should be removed <span class="gemarra-regular">with wooden prongs, so as not to increase the impurity, </span>as a wooden prong is not susceptible to impurity.
It is obvious that on a weekday the creeping animal carcass is removed from wherever it is found in the Temple, but <span class="gemarra-regular">from where does one remove it </span>on Shabbat? <span class="gemarra-regular">From the Sanctuary, from the Entrance Hall, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and from </span>the area in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">between the Entrance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Hall and the altar, </span>the most sanctified precincts of the Temple. However, it need not be removed from the rest of the courtyard. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon ben Nannas.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says: Any place where one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is liable to </span>be punished with <span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span> if he <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally </span>enters there in a state of ritual impurity, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>is liable to bring a <span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offering </span>if he does so <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly, from there one </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">remove it. </span>This includes the entire area of the Temple courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rest of the places </span>in the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">one covers </span>the creeping animal carcass <span class="gemarra-regular">with a bowl [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pesakhter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> and leaves it there until the conclusion of Shabbat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon says </span>that this is the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wherever the Sages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>something <span class="gemarra-regular">to you, they granted you </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">from your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">own, as they permitted to you only </span>activities that are prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">due to rabbinic decree, </span>not labors prohibited by Torah law.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Tavi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Kisna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who brings into the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Temple </span>an object that was <span class="gemarra-regular">defiled</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by a creeping animal </span>carcass, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is liable, </span>but if he brings in the carcass of <span class="gemarra-regular">a creeping animal itself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he is exempt. What is the reason </span>for this distinction? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse said: “Both male and female shall you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> put out, </span>without the camp shall you put them; that they defile not their camp, in the midst whereof I dwell” (Numbers 5:3). This verse teaches that the obligation to send out of the camp applies only to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has </span>the option of <span class="gemarra-regular">purification in a ritual bath, </span>i.e., the male and female mentioned by the Torah; this <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes </span>the carcass of <span class="gemarra-regular">a creeping animal, which has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no purification. </span>Consequently, one who brings the carcass of a creeping animal into the Temple is exempt, as he did not transgress the Torah’s commandment to send away the impure.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">supports him: “Both male and female</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall you put out”; </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes an earthenware vessel. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. What is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>for this? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not because </span>an earthenware vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have purification in a ritual bath</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in accordance with the opinion of Rav Tavi bar Kisna?
The Gemara rejects this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the reason is that only <span class="gemarra-regular">something that can become a primary source of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity, </span>i.e., a human being or a metal utensil, must be sent out of the camp. This <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an earthenware vessel, which cannot become a primary source of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that this issue, whether or not there is liability for bringing a creeping animal carcass into the Temple, is <span class="gemarra-regular">parallel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as we learned in the mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a creeping animal </span>carcass <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is found in the Temple, a priest </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">carry it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">in his girdle, so as not to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">delay </span>the removal of <span class="gemarra-regular">the impurity. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka. Rabbi Yehuda says: He </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">remove it with wooden prongs, so as not to increase </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the impurity. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What, isn’t it </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">that this </span>is the matter with regard to which the two <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree: The one who said </span>we should <span class="gemarra-regular">not delay </span>the removal of the impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who brings a creeping animal </span>carcass <span class="gemarra-regular">into the Temple </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is liable, </span>and therefore every effort must be made to remove it immediately. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the one who said </span>we should <span class="gemarra-regular">not increase impurity maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who brings a creeping </span><span class="gemarra-regular">animal </span>carcass <span class="gemarra-regular">into the Temple is exempt. </span>As no special command is in effect, the correct procedure is to prevent any additional impurity.
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that one who brings a creeping animal carcass itself into the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable, and here, this </span>is the matter with regard to which <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree: The </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: Delaying </span>removal of the <span class="gemarra-regular">impurit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> is the consideration that <span class="gemarra-regular">takes precedence. </span>Consequently, it is permitted even to defile the priestly garments to prevent any delay in the removal of the impurity from the holy place. <span class="gemarra-regular">Whereas the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: Increasing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">impurity </span>is the consideration that <span class="gemarra-regular">takes precedence, </span>and therefore the impurity should be removed only by means of wooden prongs. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Gemara suggests that this issue is the subject of a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as we learned </span>in that same mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where does one remove </span>the creeping animal carcass? Rabbi Shimon ben Nannas and Rabbi Akiva disagree whether it is removed only from the Sanctuary, the Entrance Hall, and the area of the courtyard between the Entrance Hall and the altar, or from the entire area of the courtyard as well. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the two <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree about the following: The one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>we do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>remove it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who brings a creeping animal </span>carcass <span class="gemarra-regular">into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Templ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is exempt, </span>and there is therefore no obligation to remove it from the courtyard on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the one who said that </span>it must be removed <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the entire courtyard maintains </span>that one who brings a creeping animal carcass into the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable. </span>

Daf 105a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Both </span>of them, Rabbi Shimon ben Nannas and Rabbi Akiva, <span class="gemarra-regular">derived their opinions from the same</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verse: “And the priests went into the inner part of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the House of God, to cleanse it, and they brought</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out all the impurity that they found in the Temple</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of God into the courtyard of the House of God</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And the Levites took it, to carry it out to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the brook of Kidron” </span>(II Chronicles 29:16).
One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Shimon Ben Nannas, <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">As there was a change </span>from the priests who removed the ritual impurity from the inner part of the Temple to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Levites, </span>who took over <span class="gemarra-regular">in the courtyard, </span>this indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>obligation to remove <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the courtyard, </span>and consequently the priests are not required to do so. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Akiva, <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains: Up to where it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is impossible </span>for the task to be performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Levites, </span>as it is prohibited for Levites to enter the Sanctuary, <span class="gemarra-regular">the priests took it out. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">now </span>in the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is possible </span>for the ritual impurity to be removed <span class="gemarra-regular">by the Levites, the priests no longer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">render themselves ritually impure, </span>as they are prohibited from maintaining contact with ritual impurity for any longer than necessary. That is to say, the Levites removed it from any place where they were permitted to enter. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: It is permitted for <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">enter the Sanctuary to build, to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> repair, or to remove impurity </span>from inside. However, wherever possible, <span class="gemarra-regular">the mitzva is </span>for these tasks to be performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> priests</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If no priests are available, Levites enter; if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no Levites are available, Israelites enter. In both </span>cases, if <span class="gemarra-regular">they are </span>ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">pure, yes, </span>they may enter, but if <span class="gemarra-regular">they are impure, no, </span>they may not enter the holy place.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: Rav Kahana</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who was a priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">supports priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> by emphasizing their special sanctity. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Kahana taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is stated </span>with regard to a priest who has a physical blemish, <span class="gemarra-regular">“Only he shall not go in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unto the veil, </span>nor come near to the altar, because he has a blemish, that he profane not My holy places; for I am the Lord who sanctifies them” (Leviticus 21:23), I <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">priests with blemishes </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not enter </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the Entrance Hall and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">altar to manufacture beaten plate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of gold for the Holy of Holies.
Therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse teaches “only”</span> as an expression of exclusion, which means that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a distinction </span>here: Although the <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva</span> should be performed with <span class="gemarra-regular">unblemished </span>priests <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">if no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> unblemished </span>priests <span class="gemarra-regular">are available, blemished ones </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">enter. </span>Likewise, it is the duty of ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">pure </span>priests; <span class="gemarra-regular">if no pure</span> priests <span class="gemarra-regular">are available, impur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ones </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">enter. In both </span>cases, if they are <span class="gemarra-regular">priests, yes, </span>they may enter, but if they are <span class="gemarra-regular">Israelites, no, </span>they may not enter the holy place. According to Rav Kahana, ritually impure priests take precedence over ritually pure Israelites. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised</span> before the Sages: If one priest is ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">impure and</span> another <span class="gemarra-regular">has a blemish, which of them </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span>to perform repairs? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">impure one </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">enter, as he is permitted</span> to participate <span class="gemarra-regular">in communal service. </span>If the entire community is ritually impure, even impure priests may perform the service, whereas blemished priests may not serve under any circumstances. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">one with the blemish </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">enter, as he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted to eat consecrated foods, </span>which indicates that he retains the sanctity of the priesthood despite his blemish. The Gemara leaves this question unresolved.
We learned in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>Wherever the Sages permitted an action to you, they granted you only from your own. The Gemara asks: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, on the basis of what </span>mishna did he formulate this principle? The Gemara answers: He taught this principle <span class="gemarra-regular">on the basis </span>of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there, as we learned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">whom it grew dark </span>while he was <span class="gemarra-regular">outside the </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, even </span>if he was only <span class="gemarra-regular">one cubit </span>outside the limit <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not enter</span> the town. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: Even </span>if he was <span class="gemarra-regular">fifteen</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits </span>outside the limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span>the town, <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span> when <span class="gemarra-regular">the surveyors </span>mark the Shabbat limit, they <span class="gemarra-regular">do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> measure precisely. </span>Rather they position the boundary mark within the two-thousand-cubit limit, <span class="gemarra-regular">because of those who err. </span>
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said, </span>i.e., that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not enter, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon said to </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">enter. </span>His reason, as stated, is that the limit does in fact extend that far, as any area the Sages granted to a person was actually permitted to him by Torah law.
Rabbi Shimon further said: <span class="gemarra-regular">As they permitted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to you only </span>activities prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">due to rabbinic decree, </span>but not actions prohibited by Torah law. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">On</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the basis of what </span>teaching did he formulate this principle? The Gemara answers: He taught it <span class="gemarra-regular">on the basis </span>of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there, where the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>with regard to a harp string in the Temple that broke on Shabbat, that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">tie it </span>with a knot, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Shimon said: He </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">form </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a bow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The reason why only <span class="gemarra-regular">forming a bow </span>is permitted, is <span class="gemarra-regular">that it cannot lead</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to liability for a sin-offering, </span>as forming a bow cannot constitute a violation of the category of the prohibited labor of tying. Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages permitted it. </span>However, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">tying </span>a knot, <span class="gemarra-regular">which can lead to liability</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for a sin-offering </span>when performed outside the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sages did not permit it, </span>as Rabbi Shimon maintains that the Sages permitted only activities whose prohibition involves a rabbinic decree.
