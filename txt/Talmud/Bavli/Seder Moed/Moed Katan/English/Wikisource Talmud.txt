Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

[Mishnah]  AN IRRIGATED FIELD MAY BE WATERED DURING THE FESTIVAL [WEEK] OR IN THE SABBATICAL YEAR BOTH FROM A NEWLY-EMERGING SPRING AND FROM A SPRING THAT IS NOT JUST EMERGED, 
BUT NOT WITH WATER FROM STORED RAIN, NOR FROM A SWIPE-WELL; 
NOR MAY SMALL BASINS BE FORMED ABOUT THE VINES. 
R. ELEAZAR B. AZARIAH SAYS THAT 
A [WATER] CHANNEL MAY NOT BE NEWLY MADE DURING THE FESTIVAL [WEEK], NOR IN THE SABBATICAL YEAR; BUT THE SAGES SAY THAT 
A CHANNEL MAY BE NEWLY MADE IN THE SABBATICAL YEAR AND ONE THAT HAS GOT OUT OF ORDER MAY BE REPAIRED DURING THE FESTIVAL [WEEK]. 
AND IMPAIRED WATER WORKS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN MAY BE REPAIRED OR CLEANED OUT; AND ROADS, BROADWAYS AND [RITUAL] POOLS MAY BE PUT IN ORDER. AND ALL PUBLIC NEEDS MAY BE PERFORMED, AND GRAVESIDES MAY BE MARKED, AND [PUBLIC COMMISSIONERS] MAY SET OUT ALSO TO INSPECT DIVERSE SEED-CROPS. 
[Gemarah]  Now, one might argue that after [having permitted] watering FROM A NEWLY EMERGING spring — which is apt to come along tearing up [the soil] — need further mention be made of [drawing from] A SPRING THAT IS NOT NEWLY EMERGING-which is unlikely to come tearing up [the soil]? 
— I may answer that 
it is necessary [to mention the latter]; 
for if [the Tanna] had mentioned only the newly emerging spring I might have said that 
only here [where it is] for an irrigation plot it is permitted — but not for a Baal-plot, because it is apt to come tearing up [the soil]; 
but [on the other hand], from a spring that is not newly emerging, which is unlikely to come tearing up [the soil], I might say that even a Baal-plot [may be watered]; therefore he informs us that there is 
no difference; be it a spring newly emerging, or a spring not newly emerging, an irrigation plot may be watered therefrom, but a Baal-plot may not be.  
And whence [know we] that the term BETH HA-SHELAHIN denotes a ‘thirsty’ field? — It is written: When thou wast faint and weary, and we render the word ‘faint’ 
[in Aramaic] by meshalhi. 
And whence [know we] that Beth ha-Baal denotes ‘settled’ soil? — It is written: For as a man be the husband [yib'al] of a maiden, so shall thy sons be as husbands unto thee and we render [in Aramaic], 
‘Behold as a young man settles down with a maiden, thy sons shall become settled in the midst of thee’. 
Who may be the [unnamed] Tanna who maintains that [work to prevent] loss is allowed, but [to augment] profit is not allowed; and that even in [averting] loss we should not do any laborious work? 
Said R. Huna: 
It is [the view of] R. Eliezer b. Jacob, as we learned: R. Eliezer b. Jacob says: 
Water may be trained along from tree to tree, provided that one does not water thus the entire field.  
I grant you may understand R. Eliezer [b. Jacob] to disallow exertion to enhance profit, but could you also understand him [from here] to disallow exertion [even] where loss is [involved]? 
Rather, said R. Papa, (whose view is it)? 
It is R. Judah's, as it is taught: 
‘A spring newly emerging may be [used for] watering even (a field that is) a Baal-plot. So R. Meir; 
R. Judah says, 
None but (a field that is) a ‘languid plot’ that has dried up may be watered [therefrom]. 
R. Eleazar b. ‘Azariah says, 
Neither one nor the other. 
R. Judah went even further and said, 
‘A person may not clean out a water channel and [with the dredging] water his garden of debris — [heap] during the festival week’. [Now] 
what is [meant by a ‘languid plot’] that dried up? 
If you say, literally dried up’ what is the good of watering it? 
— Said Abaye, 
It means that this [old] spring has run dry and another has [just] emerged [instead]. 
‘R. Eleazar b. Azariah says, Neither one nor the other’. 
[By this he means to say that] it makes no difference whether the [old] spring has run dry or has not run dry, a newly emerging spring is not to be used. 
But how [do you arrive at this conclusion]? Perhaps when R.Judah said that a languid plot may be watered from a newly emerging spring and a Baal-plot may not be,
