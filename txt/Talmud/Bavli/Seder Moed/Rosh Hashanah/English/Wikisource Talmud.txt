Rosh Hashanah

Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

[Mishna] THERE ARE FOUR NEW YEARS. 
ON THE FIRST OF NISAN IS NEW YEAR FOR KINGS AND FOR FESTIVALS. ON THE FIRST OF ELUL IS NEW YEAR FOR THE TITHE OF CATTLE. 
R. ELEAZAR AND R. SIMEON, HOWEVER, PLACE THIS ON 
THE FIRST OF TISHRI.  
ON THE FIRST OF TISHRI IS NEW YEAR FOR YEARS, FOR RELEASE AND JUBILEE YEARS, FOR PLANTATION AND FOR [TITHE OF] VEGETABLES.  
ON THE FIRST OF SHEBAT IS NEW YEAR FOR TREES, ACCORDING TO THE RULING OF BETH SHAMMAI; BETH HILLEL, HOWEVER, PLACE IT ON 
THE FIFTEENTH OF THAT MONTH.
[Gemara] FOR KINGS. Why this law? 
— R. Hisda said: 
For dealing with documents, 
as we have learnt: 
‘Bonds if antedated are invalid, but if postdated are valid’. 
Our Rabbis learnt: 
If a king ascended the throne on the twenty-ninth of Adar, as soon as the first of Nisan arrives he is reckoned to have reigned a year. 
If on the other hand he ascended the throne on the first of Nisan, he is not reckoned to have reigned a year till the next first of Nisan comes round. 
The Master has said, 
‘If a king ascends the throne on the twenty-ninth of Adar, as soon as the first of Nisan arrives he is reckoned to have reigned a year.’
