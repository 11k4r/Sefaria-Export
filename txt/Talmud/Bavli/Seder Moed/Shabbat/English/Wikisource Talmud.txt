Shabbat

Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

[MISHNAH] THE CARRYINGS OUT OF THE SABBATH ARE TWO WHICH ARE FOUR WITHIN, AND TWO WHICH ARE FOUR WITHOUT. HOW SO? 
THE POOR MAN STANDS WITHOUT AND THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WITHIN: IF THE POOR MAN STRETCHES HIS HAND WITHIN AND PLACES [AN ARTICLE] INTO THE HAND OF THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE, OR [ii] IF HE TAKES [AN ARTICLE] FROM IT AND CARRIES IT OUT, THE POOR MAN IS LIABLE, AND THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE IS EXEMPT. 
[AGAIN] IF THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE STRETCHES HIS HAND WITHOUT AND PLACES [AN OBJECT] IN THE POOR MAN'S HAND, OR TAKES [AN OBJECT] THEREFROM AND CARRIES IT IN, THE MASTER IS LIABLE, WHILE THE POOR MAN IS EXEMPT.  
IF THE POOR MAN STRETCHES HIS HAND WITHIN AND THE MASTER TAKES [AN OBJECT] FROM IT, OR PLACES [AN OBJECT] THEREIN AND HE CARRIES IT OUT, BOTH ARE EXEMPT; 
IF THE MASTER STRETCHES HIS HAND WITHOUT AND THE POOR MAN TAKES [AN OBJECT] FROM IT, OR PLACES [AN ARTICLE] THEREIN AND HE CARRIES IT INSIDE, BOTH ARE EXEMPT.   
[GEMARAH] We learnt elsewhere: [False] oaths are two which are four:

Daf 2b

the forms of consciousness of uncleanness are two which are four; the appearances of leprosy are two, which are four; the carryings out of the Sabbath are two which are four. 
Now, why is it taught here, 
TWO WHICH ARE FOUR WITHIN, AND TWO WHICH ARE FOUR WITHOUT; whereas there it is [simply] stated, 
'two which are four,' and nothing else? 
— Here, since the Sabbath is the main theme, [both] principal [forms of labour] and derivatives are taught; but there, since the main theme is not the Sabbath, principal labours only are taught, but not derivatives. 
What are the principal labours? — carryings out! But the carryings out are only two? 
And should you answer, some of these involve liability, and some do not involve liability — surely it is taught on a par with the appearances of leprosy: just as there all involve liability, so here too all involve liability? 
— No said R. Papa: 
here that the Sabbath is the main theme, acts of liability and non-liability are taught; there, since the Sabbath is not the main theme, only acts of liability are taught, but not of exemptions. 
Now, what are the cases of liability-carryings out? But the carryings out are [only] two? 
— There are two forms of carrying out and two of carrying in. 
But 'carry ings out' are taught? — 
Said R. Ashi: 
The Tanna designates carrying in' too as 'carrying out.' 
How do you know it? 
— Because we learnt: If one carries out [an object] from one domain to another, he is liable. Does this not mean even if he carries [it] in from the public to a private domain, and yet it is called 'carrying out.' 
And what is the reason? — Every removal of an article from its place the Tanna designates 'carrying out.' 
Rabina said: 
Our Mishnah too proves it, because CARRYINGS OUT are taught, yet straightway a definition of carrying in is given; 
this proves it. 
Raba said: 
He [the Tanna] teaches [the number of] domains; the domains of the Sabbath are two.
R. Mattenah objected to Abaye: 
Are there eight? 
but there are twelve! 
— But according to your reasoning, there are sixteen! 
Said he to him, 
That is no difficulty: 
as for the first clause, it is well:

Daf 3a

he does not teach what involves no liability and is [also] permitted. But the last clause, where no liability is involved, yet it is forbidden, is indeed difficult. 
(But is there in the whole [of the laws relating to] Sabbath [an action described as involving] no liability [yet] permitted: 
did not Samuel say: 
Everything [taught as] involving no liability on the Sabbath, involves [indeed] no liability, yet it is forbidden, save these three, which involve no liability and are [also] permitted: 
[viz.,] the capture of a deer, the capture of a snake, and the manipulation of an abscess? — 
Samuel desires to say this only of exemptions where an act is performed; but as for exemptions where no act [at all] is done, [of such] there are many?
Yet still there are twelve? 
— Non-liable acts whereby one can come to the liability of a sin-offering are counted; those whereby one cannot come to the liability of a sin-offering are not counted.
'BOTH ARE EXEMPT?' 
But between them a [complete] action is performed! 
— It was taught: 
[And if anyone] of the common people sin unwittingly, in doing [any of the things etc.]: only he who performs the whole of it [a forbidden action], but not he who performs a portion thereof. [Hence] if a single person performs it, he is liable; if two perform it, they are exempt. 
It was stated likewise: R. Hiyya b. Gamada said: 
It emanated from the mouth of the company and they said: 
'In doing': if a single person performs it, he is liable: if two perform it, they are exempt.
Rab asked Rabbi: 
If one's neighbour loads him with food and drink, and he carries them without, what is the law? 
Is the removing of one's body like the removing of an article from its place, and so he is liable; or perhaps it is not so? 
He replied: 
He is liable, and it is not like his hand. 
What is the reason? 
— His body is at rest whereas his hand is not at rest.
