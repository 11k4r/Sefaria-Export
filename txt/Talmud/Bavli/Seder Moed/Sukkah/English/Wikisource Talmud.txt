Sukkah

Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

[Mishnah]  A SUKKAH WHICH IS MORE THAN TWENTY CUBITS HIGH IS NOT VALID, R. JUDAH, HOWEVER, DECLARES IT VALID. 
ONE WHICH IS NOT TEN HAND BREADTHS HIGH, OR WHICH HAS NOT THREE WALLS, OR WHICH HAS MORE SUN THAN SHADE, IS NOT VALID.
[Gemarah]  We have learnt elsewhere: 
If the [cross-beam above an] alley-entry is more than twenty cubits high, it must be lowered. R. Judah says this is unnecessary. 
Now wherein lies the difference [between the two cases that] with regard to the Sukkah it is declared NOT VALID, while with regard to [the cross-beam over] the alley-entry, a remedy is indicated? 
—With regard to the Sukkah, since it is a Pentateuchal ordinance, it [was proper categorically to] state, NOT VALID; with regard to [the cross-beam over] an alley-entry, however, since the injunction is only Rabbinical, a remedy is given. 
And, if you wish, you may say 
that even with a Pentateuchal command a remedy may be given, 
but with regard to the Sukkah, as the ordinances relating thereto are many it was briefly stated, NOT VALID [while in the case of a cross-beam over] an alley-entry, since the regulations thereof are not many, a remedy is indicated. 
Whence do we know this? 
— Rabbah answered: Scripture says, 
That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, [with a booth] up to twenty cubits [high] a man ‘knows’ that he is dwelling in a booth, but with one higher than twenty cubits he does not ‘know’ that he is dwelling in a booth, since his eye does not descry it. 
R. Zera replied: From the following verse, 
And there shall be a booth for a shadow in the daytime from the heat. [With a booth] up to twenty cubits [high] a man sits in the shade of the booth; but with one higher than twenty cubits he sits, not in the shade of the booth but in the shade of its walls. 
Said Abaye to him , 
But if so, if a man made his Sukkah in Ashteroth Karnayim’ would it also be no valid Sukkah? 
— He answered him: In that case, remove the ‘Ashteroth Karnayim’ and there will remain the shade of the Sukkah, but here, remove the walls, and you have no shade of a Sukkah. 
Raba replied: [It is derived] from the following verse, 
Ye shall dwell in booths seven days, 
the Torah declared, 
For the whole seven days leave thy permanent abode and dwell in a temporary abode. 
[With a booth] up to twenty cubits [high] a man makes his abode a temporary one; [in one] higher than twenty cubits, a man does not make his abode temporary, but permanent. 
Said Abaye to him, 
But if so, if he made walls of iron and placed the [proper] covering over them, would it also be no valid Sukkah. 
The other answered him, it is this that I mean to tell you: 
[In a booth] up to twenty cubits, which a man makes his temporary abode, even if he makes it permanent, he has fulfilled his obligation; 
[but in one] higher than twenty cubits, such as a man makes his permanent abode, even if he makes it temporary, he has not fulfilled his obligation.
