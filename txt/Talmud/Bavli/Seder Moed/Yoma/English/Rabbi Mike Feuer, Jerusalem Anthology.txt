‘and it was called foundation.’ 
He taught: 
Because from it the world was founded. 
We have learned according to the one who says that the world was created from Tzion. 
For it is taught, R’ Eliezer says: 
the world was created from its middle as it says, “When the dust was poured into a mass and the clods cleaved together.” (Iyov 38:38) R’ Yehoshua says: 
the world was created from the sides as it says, “For He says to the snow, 'Be upon the earth'; likewise to the shower of rain and to the showers of His mighty rain.” (Iyov 37:6) 
R’ Yitzchak (Nafcha) said: 
The Holy One cast a stone into the sea and from it the world was founded as it says, “On what were its sockets sunk, or who laid its cornerstone?” (Iyov 38:6) 
The Sages say: 
from Tzion it was created as it says, “A song of Asaph; God, God the Lord, spoke and called to the earth, from the rising of the sun until its setting.” (Tehillim 50:1) And it says, “From Zion, the perfection of beauty, God appeared” (Tehillim 50:2) - from it the beauty of the world was perfected.
