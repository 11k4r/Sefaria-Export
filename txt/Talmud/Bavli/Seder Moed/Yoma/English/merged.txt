Daf 1b



Daf 2a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Seven </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">prior to Yom Kippur </span>the Sages would <span class="gemarra-regular">remove</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the High </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who performs the entire Yom Kippur service, <span class="gemarra-regular">from his house to the Chamber of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Parhedrin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a room in the Temple designated specifically for the High Priest during that period. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they would designate another </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pries</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in his stead </span>to replace him <span class="gemarra-regular">lest a disqualification </span>due to impurity or another circumstance beyond his control prevent him from entering the Temple on Yom Kippur. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>The Sages would <span class="gemarra-regular">even designate another wife for him lest his wife die,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated </span>in the Torah portion of the Yom Kippur service: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And it will atone for him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and for his house” </span>(Leviticus 16:6); the Sages interpreted the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">His house, that is his wife. </span>The priest must be married in order to fulfill this commandment. Due to the concern lest his wife die, another wife was designated to address that possibility. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Rabbis said </span>to Rabbi Yehuda: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>that this is a concern, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span><span class="gemarra-regular">end to the matter, </span>as what if the designated replacement wife dies? This possibility need not be a source of concern. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of sequestering the High Priest prior to his performance of the Temple service on Yom Kippur is comparable to the sequestering of the priest designated to burn the red heifer. Therefore, the Gemara cites that which <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in tractate <span class="it-text">Para</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Seven days prior to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">burning of the </span>red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">would remove the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">priest who burns the heifer from his house to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">chamber that was before the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bira</span> at the <span class="gemarra-regular">northeast </span>corner of the courtyard on the Temple Mount. And that chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">was called the Chamber of the Stone House. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why was it called the Chamber of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Stone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">House</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because all the actions </span>associated with the red heifer were performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in dung </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vessels</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">stone vessels, and earth </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vessels</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which are vessels that cannot become ritually impure. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that they were so stringent with regard to the purity of the heifer? The Gemara explains: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>a priest who <span class="gemarra-regular">immersed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that day is fit </span>for service and may perform the ritual of the <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer </span>after immersion, even before sunset, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">They would </span>intentionally <span class="gemarra-regular">render the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">priest who burns the heifer ritually impur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and immerse him</span> immediately, <span class="gemarra-regular">to remove </span>a misconception <span class="gemarra-regular">from the hearts of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sadducee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> by means of a public display of disregard for their ruling. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>the Sadducees <span class="gemarra-regular">would say: Only </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">those for whom the sun set was </span>the heifer ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">performed. </span>The Sadducees believed that it is prohibited for priests who began the purification process with immersion during that day to burn the red heifer until sunset, when the purification process is completed. 
That mishna continues: Since they would intentionally render the priest who burned the heifer ritually impure, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages </span>in turn <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted </span>the stringencies of utilizing <span class="gemarra-regular">dung vessels, stone vessels, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">earth vessels, which do not </span>have the capacity to <span class="gemarra-regular">become </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure, lest people </span>come <span class="gemarra-regular">to treat </span>the ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contempt </span>and perform it in ritual impurity after seeing that the red heifer ritual was performed by one who immersed that day.
Apropos the mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Para</span>, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different about </span>the chamber located in the <span class="gemarra-regular">northeast </span>corner of the Temple courtyard that led the Sages to house the priest performing the red heifer ritual specifically in that chamber? The Gemara answers: It is different <span class="gemarra-regular">since it is a sin-offering, </span>as the red heifer is referred to as a sin-offering in the Torah, and the slaughter and sprinkling of the blood of <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering </span>must be performed <span class="gemarra-regular">north </span>of the altar; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written with regard to </span>the red heifer: “And sprinkle it <span class="gemarra-regular">before the opening of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Tent of Meeting” </span>(Numbers 19:4), and before the Tent of Meeting means on its eastern side. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">established a chamber in the northeast </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the ritual of the red heifer <span class="gemarra-regular">will have a distinctive indicator</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> this will cause the administering priest to be vigilant in its performance.
The Gemara asks with regard to the terminology of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of the term <span class="gemarra-italic">bira</span> cited there? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: There was a place on the Temple </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Mount and its name is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and the Chamber of the Stone House was adjacent to it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Reish Lakish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: The entire Temple is called </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated </span>in the prayer of David: “To Solomon my son grant a wholesome heart, to observe your commandments, your admonitions, and your statutes, to fulfill them all, and to build <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bira</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for which I have made provision” </span>(I Chronicles 29:19). 
§ With regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of sequestering the High Priest prior to performance of the Yom Kippur service, and of sequestering the priest designated to burn the heifer prior to performance of the red heifer ritual, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>in the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">are these matters </span>derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Minyomi bar Ḥilkiya </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Maḥseya bar Idi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>they are derived from Aaron and his sons, who remained in the Tabernacle for seven days prior to performing the service in the Tabernacle on the eighth day of their inauguration, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the verse states: “As has been done </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this day, so the Lord has commanded to do, to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">make atonement for you” </span>(Leviticus 8:34), meaning that this mitzva of sequestering was not limited to the days prior to the dedication of the Tabernacle; rather, it applies to future generations as well. The verse is interpreted homiletically: <span class="gemarra-regular">“To </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do”; these are the actions </span>performed in the burning of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer </span>for which the priest performing the ritual is sequestered seven days in advance; <span class="gemarra-regular">“to make atonement”; these</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are the actions </span>performed on <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur, </span>before which the High Priest is sequestered seven days.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the entire verse is not established as referring </span>exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer, </span>as: <span class="gemarra-regular">“To atone,” is written, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the heifer is not capable of </span>facilitating <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement; </span>rather, it facilitates ritual purity. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire verse is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written with regard to Yom Kippur, </span>as the rites performed to achieve atonement on Yom Kippur are similar to those performed during the days of the inauguration. What, then, is the source for sequestering the priest who is to perform the red heifer ritual? 
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Derive </span>it from a verbal analogy between the terms <span class="gemarra-regular">commanded </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">commanded. It is stated here, </span>with regard to the days of the inauguration: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The Lord commanded to do</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” and it is stated there, </span>with regard to the red heifer: <span class="gemarra-regular">“This is the statute of the Torah that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Lord commanded, saying” </span>(Numbers 19:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>the term commanded <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>refers <span class="gemarra-regular">to the heifer, so too here, </span>the phrase: “The Lord commanded to do” written in the context of the days of the inauguration refers <span class="gemarra-regular">to the heifer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And just as here, </span>with regard to the inauguration, there is the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">sequestering </span>prior to performing the service, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too there, </span>in the context of the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the heifer, <span class="gemarra-regular">sequestering </span>is required prior to performance of the mitzva. 

Daf 2b

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And say </span>that there is indeed a verbal analogy; however, it is not between the red heifer and the inauguration of the priests, but between the term <span class="gemarra-regular">commanded </span>in the context of the inauguration and the term <span class="gemarra-regular">commanded </span>in the context <span class="gemarra-regular">of Yom Kippur,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is written: </span>“And this will be an everlasting statute for you, to atone for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year; <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did as the Lord commanded Moses” </span>(Leviticus 16:34). In that case, only the sequestering prior to Yom Kippur can be derived. The Gemara rejects this, as a verbal analogy is derived only between functionally similar phrases. <span class="gemarra-regular">One derives commanded that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">before performance, </span>as in the portion of the heifer, <span class="gemarra-regular">from commanded that is </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">before performance </span>in the portion of the inauguration; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one does not derive </span><span class="gemarra-regular">commanded that is </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">after performance </span>in the portion of Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">from commanded that is </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">before performance. </span>
Again the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that there is a verbal analogy between the term commanded in the context of the inauguration and the term <span class="gemarra-regular">commanded </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">offerings, as it is written:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “On the day that He commanded [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzavoto</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the children </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Israel </span>to sacrifice their offerings” (Leviticus 7:38). The result would be that any priest sacrificing a communal offering would require sequestering for seven days. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">derives </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">commanded from </span>the identical term <span class="gemarra-regular">commanded, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one does not derive </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">that he commanded [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzavoto</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] from </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">commanded [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tziva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the practical difference </span>between the two terms? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</span> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses between the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the priest shall return [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">veshav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Leviticus 14:39) and the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the priest shall come [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">uva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Leviticus 14:44)? From that verbal analogy it is derived that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">returning</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., it is after seven days; and <span class="gemarra-regular">this is</span> the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">coming, </span>i.e., it is also after seven days. Obviously, the less pronounced difference in grammatical forms between <span class="it-text">tziva</span> and <span class="it-text">tzavoto</span> should not prevent the teaching of a verbal analogy.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">This applies</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are no </span>terms <span class="gemarra-regular">that are identical to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it; however, where there are terms that are identical to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it, we derive </span>the verbal analogy <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>terms <span class="gemarra-regular">that are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> identical to it, </span>rather than from terms that are merely similar. 
§ The Gemara analyzes the verbal analogy from which the sequestering of the High Priest is derived. The Gemara states with regard to the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“to make atonement,” </span>written in the context of the inauguration: <span class="gemarra-regular">These are the actions </span>performed on <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur. </span>The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">And say </span>that it refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">the atonement</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of offerings </span>in general, such that any priest engaged in sacrificing atonement offerings must be sequestered seven days beforehand. 
The Gemara seeks to reject this suggestion from a practical perspective. <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we know</span> in advance <span class="gemarra-regular">which priest will happen </span>to sacrifice a given offering, and <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>would consequently <span class="gemarra-regular">require sequestering? </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Why not? </span>There are certainly ways to do so. Each of the twenty-four priestly watches has set weeks during which it serves in the Temple, and the patrilineal families that constitute that watch have set days during that week on which each serves in the Temple. <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span><span class="gemarra-regular">could require sequestering for the entire patrilineal family of the </span>priestly <span class="gemarra-regular">watch </span>designated to serve on that day the following week. The Gemara rejects the suggestion that all priests should be sequestered prior to sacrificing an atonement offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span><span class="gemarra-regular">derive a matter that has a fixed time </span>during the year, Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">from a matter that </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">has a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fixed time, </span>the inauguration of the priests for service in the Tabernacle, <span class="gemarra-regular">to the exclusion of offerings that are </span>sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">every day. </span>
Again the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And say </span>that one derives from the phrase “to make atonement” the principle of sequestering prior to sacrificing atonement offerings on the <span class="gemarra-regular">Festivals, </span>which have fixed times. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">We derive a matter that is performed once a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> year, </span>the service of Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">from a matter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is performed once a year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> like the inauguration, which was a one-time event, <span class="gemarra-regular">to the exclusion of </span>the service on the <span class="gemarra-regular">Festivals, which is not </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">once </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a year; </span>rather, it is performed three times a year. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And say </span>that the service on <span class="gemarra-regular">one Festival </span>of the three, which is performed once a year, should require sequestering. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say: We do not kno</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them </span>is the most significant and requires sequestering, since one could suggest that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">Passover, with which the verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> opened, </span>as the Torah always lists it first among the Festivals; <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>one could suggest that it is <span class="gemarra-italic">Sukkot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its mitzva </span>is to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">numerous </span>offerings, many more than the number brought on the other Festivals. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Gemara rejects this possibility and explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">One derives sequestering for seven </span><span class="gemarra-regular">days </span>prior to performing a service <span class="gemarra-regular">for one day, </span>Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">from sequestering for seven days </span>prior to performing a service <span class="gemarra-regular">for one day, </span>the inauguration. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not derive sequestering for seven days </span>prior to performing a service <span class="gemarra-regular">for seven </span>days, a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">from sequestering for seven </span><span class="gemarra-regular">days </span>prior to performing a service <span class="gemarra-regular">for one day, </span>the inauguration. Therefore, atonement offerings on Festivals are not derived from the inauguration. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And say </span>that the sequestering for seven days is prior to the festival of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Eighth </span>Day of Assembly, as that would also be <span class="gemarra-regular">sequestering for seven days </span>prior to performing a service <span class="gemarra-regular">for one day. </span>The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">One derives </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a matter before which there is not sanctity, </span>Yom Kippur, which is preceded by weekdays, <span class="gemarra-regular">from a matter before which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there is not sanctity, </span>the day of the inauguration, which was also preceded by weekdays. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">derive a matter before which there is sanctity, </span>the Eighth Day of Assembly, which is preceded by the seven days of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">from a matter before which there is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sanctity.</span>
The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is it not an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inference? Now, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter before which there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not sanctity requires sequestering, </span>due to its sanctity, then with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter before which there is sanctity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, all the more so </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>clear that it should require sequestering? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mesharshiyya said </span>in rejection of this challenge: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>there is no <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference here, as the verse: “As has been done <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>day, so the Lord has commanded to do, to make atonement for you” (Leviticus 8:34), <span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>to emphasize specifically a day <span class="gemarra-regular">like this </span>day; precisely as it was for the inauguration, and not in any other situation. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>There is another reason why it could not be that sequestering is required prior to the Eighth Day of Assembly. Is <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">matter where the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">primary Festival, </span>the first day of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not require </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sequestering, </span>as was already proven, while that which is <span class="gemarra-regular">secondary</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to it requires sequestering? </span>Since the Eighth Day of Assembly is an addendum to <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, could its sanctity and stringency be greater than that which is associated with the primary Festival? <span class="gemarra-regular">And even according to the one who said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The Eighth </span>Day of Assembly <span class="gemarra-regular">is a Festival in and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of itself </span>and is not part of the festival of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">that applies only to the matter of </span>

Daf 3a

<span class="gemarra-italic">Peh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zayin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">reish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kuf</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> an acronym for: Lottery [<span class="it-text">payis</span>], as a new lottery is performed on that day to determine which priests will sacrifice the offerings that day, and the order established on <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> does not continue; the blessing of time [<span class="it-text">zeman</span>]: Who has given us life, sustained us, and brought us to this time, is recited just as it is recited at the start of each Festival; Festival [<span class="it-text">regel</span>], as it is considered a Festival in and of itself and there is no mitzva to reside in the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> (see <span class="it-text">Tosafot</span>); offering [<span class="it-text">korban</span>], as the number of offerings sacrificed on the Eighth Day is not a continuation of the number offered on <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> but is part of a new calculation; song [<span class="it-text">shira</span>], as the Psalms recited by the Levites as the offerings were sacrificed on the Eighth Day are not a continuation of those recited on <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>; blessing [<span class="it-text">berakha</span>], as the addition to the third blessing of Grace after Meals and in the <span class="it-text">Amida</span> prayer (see <span class="it-text">Tosafot</span>) is phrased differently than the addition recited on <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>despite all these differences, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to compensation </span>for failure to sacrifice the Festival offerings at the earliest opportunity, everyone agrees that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>a day of <span class="gemarra-regular">compensation for </span>obligations not met during the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">as didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who did not celebrat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the first Festival day</span> of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> by sacrificing the Festival offering may <span class="gemarra-regular">celebrate </span>and sacrifice the Festival offering throughout <span class="gemarra-regular">the whole Festival in its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> entirety, </span>including <span class="gemarra-regular">the last Festival day of the festival </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>. Apparently, the Eighth Day of Assembly is considered the last Festival day of Sukkot and is appended to it with regard to its obligations. 
The Gemara challenges further: <span class="gemarra-regular">And say </span>that the priest should be sequestered before the festival of <span class="gemarra-italic">Shavuot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is a Festival preceded by weekdays, as there too <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>a matter of <span class="gemarra-regular">sequestering of seven </span>days <span class="gemarra-regular">for one day. Rabbi Abba said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>There is a distinction between the inauguration and <span class="it-text">Shavuot</span>, as <span class="gemarra-regular">one derives </span>an instance where the obligatory offering is <span class="gemarra-regular">one bull and one ram, </span>Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>an instance where the obligatory offering is <span class="gemarra-regular">one bull and one ram</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the inauguration, <span class="gemarra-regular">to the exclusion of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shavuot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are two rams </span>that are offered. 
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who said </span>that the obligatory offering on <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur is one ram; however, </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are two rams</span> that are sacrificed on Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say? </span>According to that opinion, Yom Kippur is not comparable to the inauguration. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: One ram is the one that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is mentioned here; </span>as it is written: “With this Aaron will come into the Sanctuary, with a young bull for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 16:3), and <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">one that is mentioned in the book </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Numbers: </span>“And on the tenth day of the seventh month you will have a sacred gathering when you will afflict your souls; you will not do any labor, and you will offer a burnt-offering to the Lord for a sweet aroma: One young bull, one ram…” (Numbers 29:7–8). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: They are two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rams </span>offered on Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">one mentioned here </span>in the book of Leviticus <span class="gemarra-regular">and one mentioned in the book of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Numbers. </span>
The Gemara rejects this solution: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon, </span>and two rams are brought on Yom Kippur, a distinction remains between Yom Kippur and <span class="it-text">Shavuot</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>with regard to Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>ram, mentioned in the book of Leviticus, is <span class="gemarra-regular">for the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">obligation of the day, </span>the atonement of Yom Kippur; <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>ram, mentioned in the book of Numbers, is for the <span class="gemarra-regular">additional offerings. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">to the exclusion of </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-italic">Shavuot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, where both </span>rams <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">obligations of the day. </span>Therefore, there is no basis for deriving the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="it-text">Shavuot</span> from the inauguration. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And say </span>that the requirement derived is to sequester the priest prior to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rosh HaShana</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as </span>there, too, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is sequestering of seven </span>days <span class="gemarra-regular">for one day. </span>The days before Rosh HaShana are weekdays, and as in the inauguration, a bull and a ram are sacrificed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu said </span>that this too is rejected: <span class="gemarra-regular">One derives a bull and a ram </span>that the High Priest brings <span class="gemarra-regular">from his own </span>property on Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a bull and a ram </span>that Aaron brought <span class="gemarra-regular">from his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> own </span>property at the inauguration. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">to the exclusion</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shavuot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rosh HaShana, </span>when the bull and the ram sacrificed are <span class="gemarra-regular">from community </span>property and not owned by the priest. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who said </span>that every time the Torah utilizes the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">Take you, </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">from your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> own </span>property, 

Daf 3b

and similarly, when the Torah states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Make you, </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">from your own </span>property. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one who said </span>that when the Torah states both phrases it means <span class="gemarra-regular">from communal </span>property, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>to distinguish between Yom Kippur and the other days? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that when the Torah states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Take </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you, </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">from your own </span>property, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>when it states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Make you, </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">from your own </span>property; however, when the Torah states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And they will bring to you, </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">from community </span>property. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoshiya. Rabbi Yonatan says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>when the Torah states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Take you, and </span>when the Torah states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they will bring to you, </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">from community </span>property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>purpose, then, <span class="gemarra-regular">does the verse state: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Take you, </span>which seems to mean from your own property? It should be understood, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it were, </span>that God said to Moses: <span class="gemarra-regular">I desire </span>that it come <span class="gemarra-regular">from your </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">more than </span>I desire it <span class="gemarra-regular">from theirs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, the taking was attributed to Moses even though it was actually from community property. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Ḥanan said in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> name of Rabbi Elazar </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one verse says: “And make</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you an ark of wood” </span>(Deuteronomy 10:1), indicating that it should be from your own property; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one verse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>on the same subject: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they shall make an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ark of acacia wood” </span>(Exodus 25:10), meaning from the Jewish people. <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>contradiction be resolved? <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>the verse is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a time when the Jewish people </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perform the will of Go</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and they are credited with building the Ark of the Covenant. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a time when the Jewish people do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perform the will of God, </span>and construction of the Ark is attributed to Moses alone. According to that opinion, there is no difference between the offerings of Yom Kippur and other offerings. 
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">They disagree only with regard to </span>instances of <span class="gemarra-regular">taking in general and </span>instances of <span class="gemarra-regular">making in general: </span>Instances of <span class="gemarra-regular">taking in general </span>are as in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Take you spices” </span>(Exodus 30:34); and instances of <span class="gemarra-regular">making</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in general </span>are as in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Make you two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> silver trumpets” </span>(Numbers 10:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>cases of inauguration and of Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">the verses explicitly </span>teach that the offerings must be <span class="gemarra-regular">from your own </span>property. <span class="gemarra-regular">With </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inauguration, now, since it is written: “And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the children of </span>Israel <span class="gemarra-regular">you will speak, saying: Take </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a goat kid for a sin-offering </span>and an unblemished year-old calf and lamb for burnt-offerings” (Leviticus 9:3), with regard to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he said to Aaron</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Take you a young calf for a sin-offering” </span>(Leviticus 9:2), <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need this clear difference between the formulation of the command to the Jewish people and the formulation of the command to Aaron? <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from it </span>that in this context the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">Take you, </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your own </span>property. 
And <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yom Kippur, now, since it is written: “With this Aaron</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will come into the Sanctuary, with a young bull</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for a sin-offering </span>and a ram for a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 16:3), with regard to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from the congregation of the children of Israel he will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">take two goat kids for a sin-offering </span>and one ram for a burnt-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>Aaron <span class="gemarra-regular">will offer his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">young bull as a sin-offering” </span>(Leviticus 16:5–6), <span class="gemarra-regular">why do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I </span>need the emphasis that the goats come from the property of the children of Israel? <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from it </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>term: <span class="gemarra-regular">His, </span>written with regard to the calf, means it <span class="gemarra-regular">is from his own </span>property. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi stated </span>another reason that distinguishes Yom Kippur from Rosh HaShana and <span class="it-text">Shavuot</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">One derives </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull for a sin-offering and ram </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for a burnt-offering </span>written with regard to Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull for a sin-offering and ram for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a burnt-offering </span>written with regard to the inauguration, <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the exclusion of Rosh HaShana and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shavuot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, on which both </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of them, </span>the bull and the ram, <span class="gemarra-regular">are burnt-offerings</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina stated </span>another distinction: <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> derives </span>a matter that is restricted to the <span class="gemarra-regular">service </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by the High Priest, </span>Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a matter that is restricted to the <span class="gemarra-regular">service </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by the High </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Priest, </span>the inauguration, which was performed by Aaron, <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exclusion of all the difficultie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> raised from the beginning of the discussion, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>on the other potential days raised, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are not </span>restricted to <span class="gemarra-regular">service </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by the High</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Priest; </span>rather, the service on those days may be performed by any priest. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: One derives </span>a matter that is an <span class="gemarra-regular">initial</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> service from an initial service, to the exclusion of all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these that are not initial </span>services. That statement of Ravina is unclear, and the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">initial </span>service? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">initial </span>service <span class="gemarra-regular">means</span> one performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by the High Priest; that is </span>identical to <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>version of Ravina’s statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it may be understood as follows: One derives <span class="gemarra-regular">the initial service </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in the place, </span>the Holy of Holies, on Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">from the initial service </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in the place, </span>the Tabernacle, on the eighth day of the inauguration. Therefore, it is the service of Yom Kippur alone that is derived from the inauguration. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: Rabbi Yoḥanan taught one </span>case derived from the inauguration, while <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi taught two. </span>The Gemara elaborates. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan taught one: To do, to make </span><span class="gemarra-regular">atonement; these are the actions </span>performed on <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur </span>that require sequestering beforehand, like the inauguration. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehoshua ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Levi taught two: To do, these are the actions </span>performed in the burning <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span>red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer; to atone, these </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are the actions </span>performed on <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur. </span>Both require sequestering. 
The Gemara asks: And did <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan teach </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>case derived from the inauguration, i.e., Yom Kippur? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we learn </span>explicitly in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Seven days prior to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yom Kippur, </span>and in another mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Seven days prior </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the burning of the heifer, </span>the Sages would remove the priest from his home? Apparently, there are two cases in which the priest is sequestered. The Gemara answers: With regard to sequestering the priest prior to the burning of the heifer, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">merely </span>established <span class="gemarra-regular">a higher standard. </span>They issued a decree to underscore the sanctity of the ritual after they permitted its performance by a priest who immersed that day. There is no Torah source for the sequestering of the priest in that case. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Minyomi bar Ḥilkiya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Maḥseya bar Idi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“As has been done </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this day, so the Lord has commanded to do, to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">make atonement for you” </span>(Leviticus 8:34), from which it is derived: <span class="gemarra-regular">To do, these are the actions </span>performed in the burning <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span>red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer; to make atonement, these are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the actions </span>performed on <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur? </span>Apparently, even Rabbi Yoḥanan taught two cases derived from inauguration. The Gemara resolves the difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">That is </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of his teacher; </span>however, he himself disagrees. <span class="gemarra-regular">As when Ravin came </span>from Eretz Yisrael, he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yishmael: To do, these are the actions </span>performed in the burning <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span>red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer; to atone, these are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the actions </span>performed on <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur. </span>That which Rabbi Manyumei cited in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan was the opinion of his teacher, Rabbi Yishmael. 
§ With regard to the sequestering of the priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: From where did you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">derive this </span>principle of sequestering? You derived it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inauguration. If so, just as </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">inauguration, </span>failure to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the details <span class="gemarra-regular">that are written in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>regard <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too here, </span>with regard to Yom Kippur, failure to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the details <span class="gemarra-regular">that are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written in its </span>regard <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates </span>the Yom Kippur service. All the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of sequestering must be precisely observed. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you say: Indeed, that </span>is so; <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t we learn</span> in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And they would designate another priest </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in his stead, and it is not taught </span>with regard to the designated priest: Seven days before Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">remove </span>him from his house, although ultimately he may perform the Yom Kippur service. Apparently, failure to sequester the priest does not invalidate the service. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">They would designate? </span>It means: <span class="gemarra-regular">They would remove; </span>that is implausible. Were that so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach either </span>with regard to both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>designated replacement: <span class="gemarra-regular">They would designate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; or </span>with regard to both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">and that</span> designated replacement: <span class="gemarra-regular">They would remove. </span>
Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Reish Lakish: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, from where do </span>you, <span class="gemarra-regular">Master, derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of sequestering before Yom Kippur? Reish Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: </span>I derive it <span class="gemarra-regular">from Sinai, as it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “And the glory of the Lord abode upon Mount Sinai</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the cloud covered him [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vaykhasehu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] six days, and He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> called to Moses on the seventh day </span>from the midst of the cloud” (Exodus 24:16). The masculine suffix <span class="it-text">hu</span> in <span class="it-text">vaykhasehu</span> can be interpreted either as him, referring to Moses, or as it, referring to the mountain. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, since it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> states: “And He called to Moses on the seventh day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” what is </span>derived from the previous explicit mention of <span class="gemarra-regular">six days? These </span>six days are mentioned as <span class="gemarra-regular">a paradigm</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> from which a general principle is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that anyone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who enters the camp of the Divine Presence, </span>the site of the revelation at Mount Sinai, or the place where the Divine Presence rests, the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">requires </span>prior <span class="gemarra-regular">sequestering for six </span>days of sanctification. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seven, </span>not six, days of sequestering that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the mishna? Reish Lakish answered: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna </span>that requires sequestering for seven days <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Beteira, who is concerned</span>

Daf 4a

<span class="gemarra-regular">about the ritual impurity of </span>the priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">home</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., his wife. This is done lest he become impure through relations with a menstruating woman, which is ritual impurity lasting seven days. Therefore, he is removed from his home for seven days. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish: Granted, </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to my </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">that I derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of sequestering <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inauguration, </span>that explains <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which is taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>priest engaged in the burning of the red heifer <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>High Priest prior to Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">one sprinkles </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upon him </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">all seven </span>days the purification water mixed with ashes from samples <span class="gemarra-regular">from all </span>the previous red heifer <span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that were </span>safeguarded <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>in the Temple. The reason for this practice is <span class="gemarra-regular">that there was also </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling during </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inauguration. However, according to your </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">that you derive it from Sinai, was there </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling at Sinai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> According to your opinion, why are the priests sprinkled?
Reish Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: And according to your reasoning, does it </span>work out <span class="gemarra-regular">well? </span>At the <span class="gemarra-regular">inauguration, </span>the sprinkling was with <span class="gemarra-regular">blood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; here, </span>the sprinkling was with <span class="gemarra-regular">water. </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan answered: <span class="gemarra-regular">That is not difficult, as Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: Water </span><span class="gemarra-regular">replaced blood, </span>but both have the status of sprinkling. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to your </span>reasoning, <span class="gemarra-regular">at Sinai, was there sprinkling </span>at all? Reish Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">merely </span>established <span class="gemarra-regular">a higher standard, </span>and this sprinkling is not a requirement. 
§ The Gemara comments: A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>that the sequestering is derived from the inauguration; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish</span> that it is derived from Sinai. The Gemara elaborates: A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan: </span>It was stated with regard to the inauguration: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">With this Aaron will come into the Sanctuary, </span>with a young bull for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 16:3). To what is the term: With this, referring? It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is stated in the matter. What is </span>the matter? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter of the inauguration</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In the manner that the priest was prepared for the inauguration, so too is he prepared for Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated in the matter of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inauguration? </span>It is that <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron </span>the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">withdrew </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>days <span class="gemarra-regular">and served one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day, and Moses transmitted </span>the Torah guidelines <span class="gemarra-regular">to him all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seven </span>days <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to train him in the </span>Sanctuary <span class="gemarra-regular">service. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>throughout the <span class="gemarra-regular">generations as well, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest withdraws </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>days prior to Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">and serves one day. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And two Torah scholars from </span>among <span class="gemarra-regular">the students of Moses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the exclusion of Sadducees, </span>who are not students of Moses, <span class="gemarra-regular">transmit </span>the Torah guidelines <span class="gemarra-regular">to him all seven</span> days <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to train him in the </span>Sanctuary <span class="gemarra-regular">service. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">From there </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Seven days prior to Yom Kippur </span>the Sages would <span class="gemarra-regular">remove the High Priest, </span>who performs the entire Yom Kippur service, <span class="gemarra-regular">from his house to the Chamber </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Parhedrin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and just as </span>the Sages would <span class="gemarra-regular">remove the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest, so do they remove the priest who burns </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the heifer, </span>from his house <span class="gemarra-regular">to the chamber that was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bira</span> at the <span class="gemarra-regular">northeast </span>corner of the courtyard on the Temple Mount. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">both this </span>priest whom the Sages sequester prior to Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>priest whom the Sages sequester prior to engaging in the burning of the heifer, <span class="gemarra-regular">one sprinkles upon him, </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">all seven </span>days of sequestering, the purification water with ashes <span class="gemarra-regular">from all the </span>previous red heifer <span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offerings that were </span>safeguarded <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>in the Temple. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that at the <span class="gemarra-regular">inauguration </span>the sprinkling was with <span class="gemarra-regular">blood, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>the sprinkling was with <span class="gemarra-regular">water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, you said: Water replaced blood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And it says</span> in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“As has been done this day, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so the Lord has commanded to do, to make atonement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for you” </span>(Leviticus 8:34). <span class="gemarra-regular">To do, these are the actions</span> performed in the burning <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span>red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer; to make</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> atonement, these are the actions </span>performed on <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur. </span>This <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, then, is proof for the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan. 
The Gemara analyzes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">With</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bezot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], is required for </span>the meaning of the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">itself; </span>the priest is required to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a young </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bull for a sin-offering and a ram for a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offering. </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the term comes to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to the offerings, let </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the verse say: With this [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bezeh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>in the masculine, referring to the bull, <span class="gemarra-regular">or: With these [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">be’elleh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>referring to the bull and the ram. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span>then, may be derived from the use of the feminine term <span class="gemarra-italic">bezot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which refers to neither the bull nor the ram? <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it two </span>conclusions; one with regard to the offerings and one with regard to sequestering. 
The Gemara continues its analysis of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Why does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cite an additional proof from another verse? Why wasn’t the first proof sufficient? <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the first</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yom Kippur </span>when Aaron performed the service <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">requires sequestering, as we find in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inauguration </span>when the priests were sequestered before being consecrated as priests, <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Yom Kippur in general, no, </span>subsequent High Priests do not require sequestering; or <span class="gemarra-regular">alternatively, </span>if you say: <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the first High Priest who requires sequestering, </span>as did all the priests during the inauguration, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>subsequent <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priests</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in general, no, </span>they do not require sequestering before Yom Kippur; then <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>that which it says in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“As has been done </span>this day, so the Lord has commanded to do,” meaning that this is a mitzva for all generations. 
§ And a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish </span>that sequestering is derived from Sinai: <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses ascended in the cloud, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was covered in the cloud, and was sanctified in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cloud, in order to receive the Torah for the Jewish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">people in sanctity, as it is stated: “And the glory </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the Lord abode upon Mount Sinai </span>and the cloud covered him six days, and He called to Moses on the seventh day from the midst of the cloud” (Exodus 24:16). <span class="gemarra-regular">This was an incident </span>that occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">after the </span>revelation of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Ten Commandments </span>to the Jewish people, and these six days <span class="gemarra-regular">were the beginning </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">forty days </span>that Moses was on the mountain (see Exodus 24:18); this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. </span>The opinion of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili corresponds to that of Reish Lakish; Moses withdrew for six days before receiving permission to stand in the presence of God. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Akiva says: </span>This incident occurred before the revelation of the Ten Commandments to the Jewish people, and when the Torah says: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the glory of the Lord abode </span>upon Mount Sinai,” it is referring to the revelation of the Divine Presence that began on the <span class="gemarra-regular">New Moon </span>of Sivan, which was six days before the revelation of the Ten Commandments. 

Daf 4b

And that which is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the cloud </span><span class="gemarra-regular">covered him,” </span>means the cloud covered it, <span class="gemarra-regular">the mountain, </span>and not him, Moses. <span class="gemarra-regular">“And He called toMoses”; Moses</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and all of the Jewish people were standing </span>at the foot of the mountain and listening, and if God did not mean that Moses was to climb the mountain, why did He call him? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse comes only to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accord deference to Moses, </span>as the entire nation heard God address him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan says: </span>Moses was in fact called to enter the cloud; however, his entrance was not for the purpose of sequestering and purifying him, <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, the verse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">comes only to cleanse the food and drink that was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in his intestines, to render him like the ministering angels </span>who require neither food nor drink. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Matya ben Ḥarash says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The verse </span>calling Moses into the cloud <span class="gemarra-regular">comes only to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">intimidate </span>Moses, to instill in him a sense of awe of the Creator, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that the Torah would be delivered </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with reverence, with quaking and with trembling, as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated: “Serve the Lord with awe, and rejoice with trembling”</span> (Psalms 2:11). Apropos the end of the verse, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">“and rejoice with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">trembling”</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Joy and trembling seem contradictory. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Mattana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: Where there is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">joy </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>fulfilling a mitzva, <span class="gemarra-regular">there will be </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">trembling </span>of the awe of Heaven <span class="gemarra-regular">there. </span>
§ Apropos the interpretation of the verse with regard to revelation, the Gemara asks: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">what do Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Akiva disagree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The Gemara explains that their dispute is parallel <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the dispute between these </span>other <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the sixth </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> month </span>of Sivan, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah, </span>the Ten Commandments, <span class="gemarra-regular">was given</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the Jewish people. Rabbi Yosei says: </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the seventh </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the month. According to the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who said </span>that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">on the sixth, </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">was given on the sixth, </span>which is the day of the revelation of the Ten Commandments, <span class="gemarra-regular">and on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seventh </span>day of the month Moses <span class="gemarra-regular">ascended </span>the mountain, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written: “And He called to Moses on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seventh day” </span>(Exodus 24:16). According to the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the Torah was given <span class="gemarra-regular">on the seventh </span>of the month, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was given on the seventh and Moses</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ascended on the seventh, as it is written: “And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he called to Moses on the seventh day.” </span>
The Gemara proceeds to link the two disputes. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">who said </span>that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">on the sixth </span>of the month <span class="gemarra-regular">that the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Torah was given; therefore, this incident occurred after </span>the revelation of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Ten Commandments. </span>That is why he explains the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the glory of the Lord abode on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Mount Sinai and the cloud covered him for six days” </span>to mean that the cloud covered <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses, and He called</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Moses on the seventh day to receive the rest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Torah. As, should it enter your mind </span>to interpret the verse as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the glory of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Lord abode” from the New Moon </span>of Sivan; <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And the cloud covered it,” the mountain; “And He called</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Moses on the seventh day,” </span>to receive only the Ten Commandments; <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t they </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">receive </span>the Ten Commandments <span class="gemarra-regular">on the sixth </span>of the month, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the cloud </span>that was on the mountain <span class="gemarra-regular">already departe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the sixth </span>of the month? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Akiva holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosei, who said that on the seventh of the month</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah was given to the Jewish people. </span>That is why Moses was summoned on the seventh of the month immediately after the revelation of the Ten Commandments. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva </span>that the Torah was given on the seventh of Sivan and Moses then proceeded to climb the mountain and remain there for forty days, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>explains the calculation <span class="gemarra-regular">that you find</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: On the seventeenth of Tammuz the tablets were shattered, </span>according to the standard tradition. How so? Calculate <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-four </span>days until the end <span class="gemarra-regular">of Sivan and sixteen </span>days <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Tammuz; they total the forty days that he was on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the mountain. On the seventeenth of Tammuz he descended </span>from the mountain <span class="gemarra-regular">and came and shattered </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">tablets. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to Rabbi Yosei </span><span class="gemarra-regular">HaGelili, who said: </span>There were <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>days <span class="gemarra-regular">of sequestering </span>after the Torah was given and an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">forty </span>days <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>Moses was on the <span class="gemarra-regular">mountain, the tablets were not shattered </span><span class="gemarra-regular">until the twenty-third of Tammuz, </span>contrary to the standard tradition. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">forty </span>days <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>Moses was on the <span class="gemarra-regular">mountain include the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>days <span class="gemarra-regular">of sequestering. </span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in that <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited above that when the Torah says: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And He called to Moses,” </span>it means that <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses and all of the Jewish people </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were standing </span>and listening. The Gemara suggests that this <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar said </span>that when the Torah says: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And He called to Moses,” </span>it means that <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses and all of the Jewish people were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> standing </span>and listening <span class="gemarra-regular">and the verse comes only to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accord deference to Moses. </span>From Rabbi Elazar’s statement it is clear that all of Israel heard the voice of God. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection: </span>The Torah states: “And when Moses went into the Tent of Meeting that He might speak with him, then he heard the voice speaking unto him from above the Ark cover that was upon the Ark of the Testimony, from between the two cherubs; and He spoke unto him” (Numbers 7:89). The Torah could have said: He heard the <span class="gemarra-regular">voice </span>speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him; however, instead the verse said: He heard the <span class="gemarra-regular">voice </span>speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">unto </span>him, indicating that the voice reached him alone. <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses </span>alone <span class="gemarra-regular">heard </span>God’s voice <span class="gemarra-regular">and all of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Jewish people did not hear </span>it. The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>case, where everyone heard God’s voice, was <span class="gemarra-regular">at Sinai. That </span>case, where Moses alone heard God’s voice, was <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Tent of Meeting. Or if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you wish, say </span>instead an alternative resolution. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> difficult; </span>when God addressed Moses by <span class="gemarra-regular">calling </span>to him, everyone heard; that which God subsequently communicated by <span class="gemarra-regular">speaking, </span>Moses alone heard. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zerika</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raised a contradiction between verses before Rabbi Elazar, and some</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zerika said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar raised a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> contradiction: It is written </span>in one place: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Moses </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting </span><span class="gemarra-regular">because the cloud dwelt on it” </span>(Exodus 40:35), as Moses was unable to enter the cloud. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written</span> elsewhere: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Moses came into the cloud” </span>(Exodus 24:18). <span class="gemarra-regular">This teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, grabbed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Moses and brought him into the cloud </span>since he could not enter on his own. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: </span>There is a verbal analogy that resolves this contradiction. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is stated here: </span>“And Moses came <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>the cloud,” <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is stated below, </span>in another verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the children of Israel went into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the sea </span>on dry land” (Exodus 14:22); <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as below</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a path </span>within the sea, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written: “And the water was a wall for them” </span>(Exodus 14:22), <span class="gemarra-regular">here too, </span>there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a path </span>through the cloud, but Moses did not actually enter the cloud. 
The verse says: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And He called unto Moses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>the Lord <span class="gemarra-regular">spoke </span>unto him from within the Tent of Meeting, saying” (Leviticus 1:1). <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>does the verse mention <span class="gemarra-regular">calling before speaking, </span>and God did not speak to him at the outset? <span class="gemarra-regular">The Torah is teaching etiquette: A person</span> should <span class="gemarra-regular">not say anything to another unless he calls him</span> first. This <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥanina said: A person should not say anything to another</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> unless he calls him </span>first. With regard to the term concluding the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Saying,” Rabbi Musya, grandson of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Masya, said in the name of Rabbi Musya the Great: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tells another </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">matter, that </span>it is incumbent upon the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">say i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> to others <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the former explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">says to him: Go and tell others? As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated: “And the Lord spoke to him from </span>within <span class="gemarra-regular">the Tent of Meeting, saying [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lemor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">].” </span><span class="it-text">Lemor</span> is a contraction of <span class="it-text">lo</span> <span class="it-text">emor</span>, meaning: Do not say. One must be given permission before transmitting information. 
§ After digressing to interpret the verses with regard to Mount Sinai, the Gemara resumes its discussion of the statements of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish. Based on the question Reish Lakish addressed to Rabbi Yoḥanan and the fact that Rabbi Yoḥanan accepted the premise of that question, we learn <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">both maintain </span>that with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">inauguration, </span>failure to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the details <span class="gemarra-regular">that are written in its </span>regard <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates </span>the inauguration. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Ḥanina </span>disagree. <span class="gemarra-regular">One said: </span>Failure to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the details <span class="gemarra-regular">that are written in its </span>regard <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates </span>the inauguration. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one said: A matter that invalidates </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout the generations</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> invalidates </span>the inauguration; <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter that does not invalidate </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout the generations does not invalidate </span>the inauguration. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan is the one who said: </span>Failure to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the details <span class="gemarra-regular">that are written in its </span>regard <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates </span>the inauguration. This may be concluded <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says to Rabbi Yoḥanan: Just</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">inauguration, </span>failure to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">all</span> the details <span class="gemarra-regular">that are written in its </span>regard <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates </span>the inauguration, so too is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">did not respond </span>and did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>say <span class="gemarra-regular">anything, </span>indicating that he agreed. The Gemara states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude </span>that this indeed is the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the practical halakhic difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the opinions of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish? 

Daf 5a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>The practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>relates to the question of <span class="gemarra-regular">placing hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> on the head of an animal brought as an offering. According <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one who said: </span>Failure to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the details <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are written in its </span>regard, including details that do not invalidate offerings throughout the generations, <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates </span>the inauguration, failure to perform the <span class="gemarra-regular">placing </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">hands </span>on the head of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">also invalidates </span>the inauguration. According <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who said: A matter that does not invalidate </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the generations does not invalidate </span>the inauguration, failure to perform the <span class="gemarra-regular">placing </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">hands </span>on the head of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">does not invalidate </span>the inauguration. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of offerings that apply <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout the generations </span>the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do we derive </span>that failure to place hands on the head of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">invalidate </span>the offering? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he shall place </span>his hand on the head of the burnt-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it shall be accepted </span>for him to atone on his behalf” (Leviticus 1:4). <span class="gemarra-regular">Does </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">placing </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">hands atone </span>for one’s sins? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t atonement </span>accomplished <span class="gemarra-regular">only by </span>the sprinkling of <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood, as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated: “For it is the blood that makes atonement by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reason of the life” </span>(Leviticus 17:11)? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>purpose, then, <span class="gemarra-regular">does the verse state: “And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he shall place…and it shall be accepted”? </span>It teaches that if <span class="gemarra-regular">one deemed </span>the ritual of <span class="gemarra-regular">placing hands </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a peripheral aspect of the mitzva </span>and consequently failed to perform it, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse ascribes to him </span>status <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> though he did not achieve </span>optimal <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>nevertheless, the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">atones </span>for his sins. Apparently, failure to lay hands on the head of the offering does not invalidate the offering throughout the generations, as atonement can be achieved without it. Nevertheless, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, failure to lay hands on the offering invalidates the offerings brought during the inauguration. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yitzḥak said: </span>The issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">waving </span>the offering is the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the opinions of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Ḥanina. According <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who said: </span>Failure to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the details <span class="gemarra-regular">that are written in its </span>regard <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates </span>the inauguration, failure to wave the offering also <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates </span>the inauguration. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who said: A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matter that does not invalidate </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout the generations does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not invalidate </span>the inauguration, failure to wave the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not invalidate </span>the inauguration. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout the generations, </span>the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do we </span>derive that failure to wave the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">does not invalidate </span>the offering? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the verse says: “He shall take one male lamb as a guilt-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">to be waved to make atonement </span>for him” (Leviticus 14:21). <span class="gemarra-regular">Does waving </span>the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">atone </span>for one’s sins? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t atonement </span>accomplished <span class="gemarra-regular">only by </span>the sprinkling of <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood, as it is stated: “For it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life” </span>(Leviticus 17:11)? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>purpose, then, <span class="gemarra-regular">does the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verse state: To be waved to make atonement? </span>It teaches that if <span class="gemarra-regular">one deemed </span>the ritual of <span class="gemarra-regular">waving </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a peripheral aspect of the mitzva </span>and therefore failed to perform it, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse ascribes to him </span>status <span class="gemarra-regular">as though</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he did not achieve </span>optimal <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement; and </span>nevertheless, the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">atones </span>for his sins on his behalf.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>The issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">sequestering </span>the priest for <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>days is the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the opinions of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Ḥanina. According <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who said: </span>Failure to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the details <span class="gemarra-regular">that are written in its </span>regard <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates </span>the inauguration, failure to sequester the priest for seven days also <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates </span>the inauguration. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who said: A matter that does not invalidate </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the generations does not invalidate </span>the inauguration, failure to sequester the priest for seven days <span class="gemarra-regular">does not invalidate </span>the inauguration. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout the generations, </span>the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>derive that failure to sequester the priest for seven days <span class="gemarra-regular">does not invalidate </span>the offering? The Gemara answers: It is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from the fact that it is taught </span>in the mishna: And <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">designate </span>another priest in his stead, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is not taught: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">remove </span>the designated priest from his house, despite the possibility that ultimately he might replace the High Priest and perform the Yom Kippur service. Apparently, sequestering is not essential. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>The issue of the priest performing the service with the <span class="gemarra-regular">multiple </span>garments of the High Priest for <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>days and serving with <span class="gemarra-regular">anointmen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>days is the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the opinions of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Ḥanina. According <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>Failure to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the details <span class="gemarra-regular">that are written </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in its </span>regard <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates </span>the inauguration, failure to serve with multiple garments and anointment for seven days also <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates </span>the inauguration. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who said: A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matter that does not invalidate </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout the generations does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not invalidate </span>the inauguration, failure to serve with multiple garments and anointment for seven days <span class="gemarra-regular">does not invalidate </span>the inauguration. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the generations, </span>the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do we </span>derive that failure to serve with multiple garments and anointment for seven days <span class="gemarra-regular">does not invalidate </span>the offering? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: For <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">does the verse state: “And the priest </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">serve in his father’s stead shall make the atonement” </span>(Leviticus 16:32)? If it comes to teach that all service must be performed by the High Priest, it is already written with regard to the Yom Kippur service that it must be performed by Aaron, the High Priest. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Since it is stated: “Seven days shall the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son that is priest in his stead don them” </span>(Exodus 29:30), <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>that one who donned the <span class="gemarra-regular">multiple</span> garments of the High Priest for <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>days <span class="gemarra-regular">and was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> anointed seven </span>days assumes the position of High Priest and may perform the service on Yom Kippur. However, with regard to whether one who donned the <span class="gemarra-regular">multiple </span>garments for <span class="gemarra-regular">seven</span> days <span class="gemarra-regular">and was anointed </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>day, or one who donned the <span class="gemarra-regular">multiple </span>garments for <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>day <span class="gemarra-regular">and was anointed</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>days is thereby inaugurated as High Priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>are those cases derived? Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">any case </span>he is appointed High Priest, even if either anointment or donning the garments did not continue for seven days. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">We found </span>a source for the fact that when the High Priest is appointed, there is a requirement of donning <span class="gemarra-regular">multiple </span>garments for <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>days <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where do we </span>derive the requirement of <span class="gemarra-regular">anointment </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>days <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>According to Ravina, there is a requirement to anoint the priest on each of the seven days <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, even though failure to do so does not invalidate the offering throughout the generations. From where is that requirement derived? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say: </span>It is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the verse: </span>“And the priest who shall be anointed and who shall be consecrated to serve in his father’s stead shall make the atonement,” <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to exclud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> requirements derived from other sources, i.e., that both donning multiple garments and anointment must be for seven days. Apparently, anointment for seven days is required <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that it is derived from <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And the sacred </span><span class="gemarra-regular">garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to be anointed in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and to be consecrated in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them” </span>(Exodus 29:29). <span class="gemarra-regular">Anointment is juxtaposed </span>in this verse <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>donning <span class="gemarra-regular">multiple </span>garments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>donning <span class="gemarra-regular">multiple </span>garments is required <span class="gemarra-regular">for seven </span>days <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, anointment </span>is required <span class="gemarra-regular">for seven </span>days <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>.
§ After ascertaining the halakhic distinctions between the opinions of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Ḥanina with regard to the inauguration, the Gemara proceeds to analyze the rationales for those opinions. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the one who said: </span>Failure to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the details <span class="gemarra-regular">that are written in its </span>regard <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates </span>the inauguration? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Bisna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verse states: “And so shall you do to Aaron and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to his sons </span>according to all that I have commanded you, seven days shall you consecrate them” (Exodus 29:35). The term: <span class="gemarra-regular">So, </span>teaches that failure to perform the ritual precisely in this manner <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates </span>the inauguration. The Gemara asks: That works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>as a source that <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>

Daf 5b

<span class="gemarra-regular">matters that are written </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the context of <span class="gemarra-regular">this topic </span>of inauguration in the book of Exodus invalidate the inauguration. However, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">matters that are not written in that context</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but are written in the portion of the inauguration in Leviticus, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where do we derive </span>that they invalidate the inauguration? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">derives a </span>verbal analogy between the word opening that appears in the two portions of the inauguration. It is written in the command concerning the inauguration: “The <span class="gemarra-regular">opening </span>of the Tent of Meeting” (Exodus 29:32), and in its fulfillment it is written: “The <span class="gemarra-regular">opening </span>of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 8:31). Failure to perform the matters written in both portions invalidates the inauguration.<br><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mesharshiyya said: </span>The verbal analogy is unnecessary, as the conclusion can be derived directly from the verse written with regard to the implementation of the inauguration: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And keep the charge of the Lord, </span>that you not die, for so I am commanded” (Leviticus 8:35). The emphasis on this being the charge of the Lord comes to teach that failure to perform all the details mentioned in the implementation of the command <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates </span>the inauguration. <br><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ashi says: </span>The phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">For so I am commanded, </span>is the source from which it is derived that all the details written in both portions <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidate </span>the inauguration. 
Apropos that phrase, the Gemara cites a related halakhic midrash. <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sages taught: </span>In the context of the implementation of the inauguration, three variations of the phrase appear: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For so I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> am commanded” </span>(Leviticus 8:35); <span class="gemarra-regular">“as I commanded” </span>(Leviticus 10:18); and <span class="gemarra-regular">“as God has commanded” </span>(Leviticus 10:15). What does this repetition teach? From the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For so I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> am commanded,” </span>it is derived that even in a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">acute mourning, </span>on the first day after the death of a relative, one must <span class="gemarra-regular">eat </span>the offering. God stated the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“As I commanded,” at the time of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the inciden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> just after the deaths of Nadav and Avihu, when Aaron and his sons were in a state of acute mourning. And when Moses states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“As God commanded</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>he is saying: The command is from God <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not from my </span>own initiative that <span class="gemarra-regular">I am saying</span> it. 
Apropos the matters mentioned that are not explicit in the portion, the Gemara cites that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Trousers </span>are one of the priestly vestments worn during the inauguration, but they <span class="gemarra-regular">are not written in the </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">portion. When </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">says: “And this is the matter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that you shall do for them to sanctify them for</span> My <span class="gemarra-regular">service” </span>(Exodus 29:1), the superfluous word: And, which appears at the beginning of the verse, comes to add to that which was written previously and <span class="gemarra-regular">to include trousers </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the tenth of an epha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> offered by a priest on the day that he begins his service. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, trousers </span>can be derived, as the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>in the context <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matter of </span>priestly <span class="gemarra-regular">garments </span>detailed adjacent to the portion of the inauguration. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the tenth of an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ephah, from where do we </span>derive that there is an obligation to offer it during the inauguration? The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">derived </span>by means of a verbal analogy between the word <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>that appears in one verse and the word <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>that appears in another. It is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“This</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they shall offer to the Lord </span>in the day when he is anointed, <span class="gemarra-regular">a tenth of an ephah” </span>(Leviticus 6:13). And in the verse cited above in the context of the inauguration it says: “And this is the matter that you shall do for them,” which teaches that there is an obligation to offer a tenth of an ephah during the inauguration. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even </span>failure to <span class="gemarra-regular">read the </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">portion </span>of the inauguration <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates </span>the inauguration? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “And Moses said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the assembly: This is the matter [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">davar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] that God</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has commanded </span>to be done” (Leviticus 8:5), teaching that <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span> failure to perform the <span class="gemarra-regular">recitation [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dibbur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>of the Torah portion to the people <span class="gemarra-regular">invalidates </span>the inauguration. 
§ Apropos the inauguration of the priests, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How, </span>i.e., in what order, did Moses <span class="gemarra-regular">dress </span>Aaron and his sons in the priestly vestments? The Gemara wonders: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what order did he dress them? </span>That is an irrelevant question, as <span class="gemarra-regular">what was, was</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The order in which Moses dressed the priests has no practical ramifications. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the question must be: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>will Moses <span class="gemarra-regular">dress </span>the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">future</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> following the resurrection of the dead, when the Temple service will be restored? The Gemara rejects this question as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">In the future, too, when Aaron and his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sons will come and Moses </span>will be <span class="gemarra-regular">with them, </span>he will know the proper sequence, and there is no point to raising the question. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the question is: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>did Moses <span class="gemarra-regular">dress them? </span>The Gemara seeks <span class="gemarra-regular">to explain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> on this topic, as they appear somewhat contradictory. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">The sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan disagree with regard to </span>this matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">One said: </span>Moses dressed <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward </span>Moses dressed <span class="gemarra-regular">his sons;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one said: </span>Moses dressed <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron and his sons simultaneously</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., consecutively from one to the next, without interruption, to avoid changing the order prescribed in the verses. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">tunic and mitre everyone agrees that </span>Moses dressed <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron and afterward his sons, as both in</span> the portion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the command </span>concerning the inauguration <span class="gemarra-regular">and in</span> the portion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the implementation, </span>mention of <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron precedes </span>mention of his sons. <span class="gemarra-regular">When they disagree, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to the belt. </span>The Gemara elaborates. The <span class="gemarra-regular">one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>Moses dressed <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron and afterward his sons </span>derives it from that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “And he girded him with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the belt” </span>(Leviticus 8:7), <span class="gemarra-regular">and then it is written: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And he girded them with belts” </span>(Leviticus 8:13). Moses first dressed Aaron in all of the garments, including the belt, and then Moses dressed Aaron’s sons. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who said: </span>Moses dressed <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron and his sons, simultaneously </span>derives it from that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">written: “And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gird them </span>with belts, Aaron and his sons” (Exodus 29:9), indicating that Moses girded them all with belts simultaneously. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who says: </span>Moses dressed <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron and his sons simultaneously, isn’t it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: He girded him with the belt, and then</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written: He girded them with belts, </span>clearly indicating that he dressed Aaron and then his sons? 

Daf 6a

The Gemara answers that he could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>verse comes to teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">the belt of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest is not the belt of the common priest.</span> It is explicit in the Torah that the belt of the High Priest is made of fine blue and purple linen. On the other hand, the Torah does not state the materials used in the belt of the common priest, which was in fact linen like the rest of the garments of the common priest. And still one can say that Aaron and his sons were dressed simultaneously. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who said </span>that Moses dressed <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">and then his sons, is it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not written: “And you will gird them with belts,” </span>indicating that they were girded simultaneously? The Gemara responds that he could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: That </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the belt of the High Priest is </span>identical to <span class="gemarra-regular">the belt of the common priest. </span>Both of them were from fine blue and purple linen. Therefore, although the Torah distinguishes between the girding of the belts, as Moses dressed Aaron before he dressed Aaron’s sons, there was a common command to make both belts, indicating that they were made of the same material. 
The Gemara asks: If they are identical, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need both the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he girded him with a belt,” </span>and the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he girded them”? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from it </span>that Moses dressed <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">then </span>dressed <span class="gemarra-regular">his sons. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And can you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> find </span>a situation where Moses could have girded Aaron and his sons <span class="gemarra-regular">simultaneously? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is necessary only</span> to state that Moses girded Aaron <span class="gemarra-regular">firs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and then proceeded to gird his sons in order of their significance. After girding Aaron he did not dress Aaron in any other garments before girding his sons. 
§ After a long digression in which many peripheral issues were addressed, the Gemara returns to interpreting the mishna. It was taught in the mishna: The Sages would <span class="gemarra-regular">remove the High Priest </span>from his house to the Chamber of <span class="it-text">Parhedrin</span>. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">remove</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The Gemara asks in astonishment: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">remove him? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we stated above: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Whether </span>it is according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Yoḥanan, as per his </span>opinion: Sequestering of the High Priest is derived from the sequestering prior to the inauguration; <span class="gemarra-regular">or whether it is </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Reish Lakish, as per his </span>opinion: Sequestering of the High Priest is derived from sequestering at Sinai, the answer is clear. What is the point of the Gemara’s question? 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>what the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Why did he withdraw from his house, </span>i.e., his wife? The Gemara explained why he must be removed to a special location; but why doesn’t his wife join him? <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Beteira says: </span>It is due to the concern <span class="gemarra-regular">lest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his wife be found </span>to be in a situation of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>as to whether or not she has the halakhic status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a menstruating woman, and </span>he will <span class="gemarra-regular">have relations</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with her </span>and become impure. 
The Gemara asks in astonishment: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing with wicked </span><span class="gemarra-regular">people? </span>Will the High Priest, aware of the uncertain status of his wife, have relations with her? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>rephrase the statement: It is due to the concern <span class="gemarra-regular">lest he have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">relations with his wife and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">she be found </span>to be in a situation of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>as to whether or not she has the halakhic status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a menstruating woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In a case where blood is found on the sheets after the couple engaged in relations, and there is uncertainty as to whether or not the High Priest had relations with his wife while she had the halakhic status of a menstruating woman, the status of the High Priest is one of uncertain impurity. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages stated </span>the following assumption <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda: In accordance with whose </span>opinion is that a reason for concern? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, who said: A menstruating woman </span>who found blood on the sheets within twenty-fours after having relations, creating uncertainty with regard to her status when she engaged in relations, <span class="gemarra-regular">renders the man who had with relations with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> her </span>retroactively <span class="gemarra-regular">impure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As, if </span>it were in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>it is difficult: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t they say </span>that a woman with regard to whom there is uncertainty as to whether or not she has the halakhic status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a menstruating woman does not render</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the man who had with relations with her </span>retroactively <span class="gemarra-regular">impure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Therefore, the High Priest need not leave his wife during the week prior to Yom Kippur.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even if you say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Akiva </span>with regard to retroactive impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case where blood was discovered on the sheets <span class="gemarra-regular">long afterward, </span>after there was time for the woman to leave the bed and bathe and only then discover the blood. Due to the time that elapsed, the Rabbis hold that there is no way to prove a connection between when the woman menstruated and when they engaged in relations. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if the blood was found merely <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">concede to </span>Rabbi Akiva that she renders the man retroactively impure. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: Learn from it </span>that one who is impure because <span class="gemarra-regular">he had relations with a menstruating woman is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unlike a menstruating woman </span>in terms of the time of immersion. Unlike the woman, who immerses after nightfall following the seventh day after her menstruation ceased, such a man may <span class="gemarra-regular">immerse </span>on the seventh <span class="gemarra-regular">day </span>and need not wait for nightfall. Therefore, if a High Priest has relations with his wife just before he is sequestered and there is uncertainty as to whether she has the halakhic status of a menstruating woman, the seventh day of his impurity occurs on Yom Kippur eve. He immerses himself that day and completes the purification process at nightfall. This allows him to enter the Temple to perform the Yom Kippur service.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if you say that </span>one who is impure because <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">had relations with a menstruating woman is like a menstruating </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woman </span>in terms of the time of immersion, <span class="gemarra-regular">when does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he immerse? </span>He may immerse only <span class="gemarra-regular">at night </span>after seven complete days. Since that night is Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">how can</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he perform </span>the Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">service the next day,? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t he required </span>to wait for <span class="gemarra-regular">sunset </span>following his immersion to complete the purification process? Until then his status is that of one who immersed that day, who may not serve in the Temple until the nightfall following his immersion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>must one <span class="gemarra-regular">not conclude from it </span>that one who is impure because <span class="gemarra-regular">he had relations with a menstruating </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woman is unlike a menstruating woman </span>in terms of the time of immersion? He immerses on the seventh day, Yom Kippur eve, and at nightfall he may serve in the Temple. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shimi from Neharde’a says: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that one who is impure because <span class="gemarra-regular">he had </span><span class="gemarra-regular">relations with a menstruating woman is like a menstruating woman </span>with regard to the time of immersion, the High Priest is not removed from his house at night. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sequester him one hour just </span>before <span class="gemarra-regular">sunset </span>on the eighth day prior to Yom Kippur, slightly before the start of the seven-day period, leaving seven full days to count prior to Yom Kippur. Although he is removed from his house more than seven days prior to Yom Kippur, that slight addition is not sufficient to have the period considered eight days. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an objection </span>to the opinion that one who is impure because he had relations with a menstruating woman immerses at night: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated in immersions, their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">immersion is during the day. </span>The exceptions are <span class="gemarra-regular">a menstruating </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woman and a woman after childbirth, whose immersion is at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">night. </span>It can be learned by inference: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a menstruating woman, yes, </span>she immerses at night; with regard to one who is impure because <span class="gemarra-regular">he had relations with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a menstruating woman, no, </span>he does not immerse at night. 
The Gemara rejects that proof because the term <span class="gemarra-regular">menstruating woman </span>in that <span class="it-text">baraita</span> includes the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">and everyone whose inclusion </span>in the impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived </span>from her status. The understanding is that a man who has relations with a menstruating woman assumes her impurity, and therefore his immersion would be identical to hers. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">objection: </span>The halakhic status of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>who is ritually impure due to <span class="gemarra-regular">a seminal emission </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that of one who came into <span class="gemarra-regular">contact with a creeping animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whereas the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>who is ritually impure because he <span class="gemarra-regular">had relations with a menstruating woman is like</span> that of one who became <span class="gemarra-regular">impure </span>with ritual impurity imparted by <span class="gemarra-regular">a corpse. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span>does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>mean that one who had relations with a menstruating woman is like one impure with impurity imparted by a corpse in terms of <span class="gemarra-regular">immersion, </span>which he may perform during the day? The Gemara rejects that conclusion. <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is merely comparing the duration of <span class="gemarra-regular">their impurity. </span>One who experiences a seminal emission is impure for one day, like one who came into contact with a creeping animal; one who has relations with a menstruating woman is impure for seven days, like one impure with impurity imparted by a corpse.
The Gemara wonders: For what purpose would the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> come to teach the duration of <span class="gemarra-regular">their impurity? </span>The Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">explicitly writes </span>the durations of <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>impurity. <span class="gemarra-regular">This, </span>one impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, has <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity of seven </span>days <span class="gemarra-regular">written in his</span> regard; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">that, </span>one who is impure because he had relations with a menstruating woman, has <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seven </span>days <span class="gemarra-regular">written in his </span>regard. There is no need for the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to derive a matter explicitly written in the Torah from another matter explicitly written in the Torah. 

Daf 6b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">it not </span>be that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is equating them with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to their immersion, </span>in that both one who has relations with a menstruating woman and one impure with impurity imparted by a corpse immerse during the day? 
The Gemara rejects that conclusion. <span class="gemarra-regular">No; actually, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the duration of <span class="gemarra-regular">their impurity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Although there is nothing novel in that equation, it <span class="gemarra-regular">was necessary for </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>in one sense, the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>who is impure because he <span class="gemarra-regular">had relations with a menstruating woman </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">more severe than</span> one impure with impurity imparted by a corpse. One who is impure because he had relations with a menstruating woman <span class="gemarra-regular">transmits impurity through </span>lying on <span class="gemarra-regular">a bed or </span>sitting on <span class="gemarra-regular">a chair, </span>even if he never came into direct contact with the chair or the bed. He renders the bed or chair impure <span class="gemarra-regular">with a mild </span>form of <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity. </span>He confers upon them first-degree ritual impurity status, sufficient only to <span class="gemarra-regular">render foods and liquids impure. </span>One impure with impurity imparted by a corpse transmits impurity by means of direct contact.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>an additional proof <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: </span>For <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the leper and the female leper, and one who had </span><span class="gemarra-regular">relations with a menstruating woman, and one who is ritually </span><span class="gemarra-regular">impure </span>with impurity imparted by <span class="gemarra-regular">a corpse, their immersion is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> during the day. </span>For <span class="gemarra-regular">a menstruating woman and a woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> after childbirth, their immersion is at night. </span>The Gemara concludes that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation </span>of the opinion of Rav Shimi from Neharde’a, who said that one who is impure because he had relations with a menstruating woman immerses at night.
With regard to the sequestering of the High Priest, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And b</span><span class="gemarra-regular">efore you remove hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the </span>potential of <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his house, remove him from the </span>potential of the more severe <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity </span>imparted by <span class="gemarra-regular">a corpse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Sages should have instituted an ordinance prohibiting visitors to the High Priest lest one die while in his chamber and render him impure. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Taḥlifa, father of Rav Huna bar Taḥlifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said in the name of Rava: That is to say</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity </span>imparted by a <span class="gemarra-regular">corpse is permitted in </span>cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">the public</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In cases where the public is involved, impurity imparted by a corpse does not prevent the Temple service from being conducted. Since the service of the High Priest on Yom Kippur is a service involving communal offerings, impurity imparted by a corpse does not invalidate the service. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say that impurity </span>imparted by <span class="gemarra-regular">a corpse is </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">overridde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in public </span>and not completely permitted, the idea that the High Priest is not removed from the potential of impurity imparted by a corpse can be understood. <span class="gemarra-regular">Impurity</span> imparted by <span class="gemarra-regular">a corpse is uncommon. </span>The likelihood that one visiting the High Priest will suddenly die is minimal. In contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity of his house is common, </span>as uncertainty with regard to his wife’s status as a menstruating woman could arise at any moment. 
There is an amoraic dispute with regard to the effect of impurity imparted by a corpse on the conduct of the Temple service. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity </span>imparted by <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> corpse </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: It is permitted in </span>cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">the public; </span>e.g., when a majority of the Jewish people is impure, the service of a ritually pure priest is not preferable to that of an impure priest. The Temple service proceeds as though there was no impurity at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Sheshet said: </span>Impurity imparted by a corpse is merely <span class="gemarra-regular">overridden in </span>cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">the public</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and service performed by a ritually pure priest is preferable. 
The Gemara restricts the scope of the dispute. In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure and pure </span>priests in <span class="gemarra-regular">that patrilineal family </span>tasked with serving in the Temple on that day, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone, </span>even Rav Naḥman, <span class="gemarra-regular">agrees that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the pure </span>priests <span class="gemarra-regular">serve </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the impure </span>priests <span class="gemarra-regular">do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> serve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> When they disagree, </span>it is with regard to a case where the entire patrilineal family is impure. Is it necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">to seek out and bring pure </span>priests <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a different patrilineal family </span>belonging to the same priestly watch, who are tasked with serving in the Temple on a different day that week? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>The prohibition against performing the Temple service in a state of impurity imparted by a corpse <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted </span>in cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">the public, and we do not</span> need to <span class="gemarra-regular">seek out </span>other priests. Since the Torah permitted the performance of the Temple service by priests impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, it is completely permitted and it is as though the service is performed in purity. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: </span>The prohibition of impurity imparted by a corpse <span class="gemarra-regular">is overridden </span>in cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">the public, </span>and wherever possible <span class="gemarra-regular">we seek out </span>ritually pure priests. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the dispute is slightly different: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually pure and ritually impure </span>priests in <span class="gemarra-regular">that patrilineal family, Rav Naḥman disagreed </span>with Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">and said </span>that the priests serve <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>when they are <span class="gemarra-regular">impure, </span>

Daf 7a

<span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>situations <span class="gemarra-regular">of impurity </span>imparted <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> corpses </span>in cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">the public, the Merciful One permits</span> those who are impure to perform the Temple service. 
The Gemara analyzes the rationale behind the two opinions. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: From where do I </span>derive to <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that impurity is overridden in cases involving the public? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">was standing and sacrificing the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">omer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> meal-offerin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and it became impure in his hand, </span>the priest, who was aware of what transpired, <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that it is impure and the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">bring another </span>meal-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">in its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stead. And if </span>the meal-offering in his hand is <span class="gemarra-regular">the only </span>meal-offering available <span class="gemarra-regular">there, the </span>other priests <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: Be shrewd and keep silent; </span>do not tell anyone that it is impure. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">In any case</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is teaching that he says </span>that it is impure and the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">bring another </span>meal-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">in its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place. </span>Apparently, when it is possible to perform the service in a state of purity, even in cases involving the public, it is preferable to do so, and the prohibition of ritual impurity is not permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span>rejected the proof and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I concede </span>that in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there are remnants </span>of the offering designated <span class="gemarra-regular">for eatin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> it must be performed in purity wherever possible. Although it is permitted to sacrifice an offering when impure, the mitzva to eat portions of the offering must be performed in a state of purity. Therefore, in cases where portions of the offering are eaten, the preference is to sacrifice the offering in a state of purity. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to the opinion of Rav Naḥman from the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: If a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">was sacrificing the meal-offering </span>accompanying the sacrifice of <span class="gemarra-regular">bulls</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rams, or sheep, and </span>the meal-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">became</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> impure in his hand, </span>the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that it is impure <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">bring another </span>meal<span class="gemarra-regular">-</span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">in its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stead. And if </span>the meal-offering in his hand is <span class="gemarra-regular">the only </span>meal-offering available <span class="gemarra-regular">there, the </span>other priests <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: Be shrewd and keep silent; </span>do not tell anyone that it is impure. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">bulls, rams, and sheep </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the festival </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, which are communal offerings that are not eaten? Apparently, even in cases of communal offerings, the priests seek to perform the service in a state of purity and the prohibition of impurity is not permitted but merely overridden. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: No, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bulls </span>mentioned in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> are not standard communal offerings. Rather, the reference is to the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull </span>sacrificed when the entire community engages in <span class="gemarra-regular">idolatry </span>unwittingly. <span class="gemarra-regular">Although </span>this offering is a <span class="gemarra-regular">communal</span> offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it has no </span>specific <span class="gemarra-regular">time fixed </span>for its sacrifice, <span class="gemarra-regular">we seek out </span>a pure meal-offering in its stead.<br>Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">the rams </span>mentioned in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> are not additional offerings of the Festival. Rather, the reference is to the <span class="gemarra-regular">ram of Aaron </span>sacrificed on Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">Although</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it has a </span>specific <span class="gemarra-regular">time fixed </span>for its sacrifice, <span class="gemarra-regular">since</span> it is an offering brought <span class="gemarra-regular">by an individual, </span>the High Priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">we seek out </span>a pure meal-offering in its stead, as service in a state of impurity is permitted only for communal offerings.<br><span class="gemarra-regular">The sheep </span>mentioned are not those for the daily offerings or the additional offerings of the Festival. Rather, the reference is to <span class="gemarra-regular">the sheep that accompanies</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">omer</span> meal-offering, as in that ase, <span class="gemarra-regular">there are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> remnants </span>designated <span class="gemarra-regular">for eating. </span>Therefore, the meal-offering must be offered in purity. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">objection </span>to the opinion of Rav Naḥman: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">blood that became impure and</span> a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkled it </span>on the altar, if he did so <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly, </span>the offering is <span class="gemarra-regular">accepted. </span>If he sprinkled the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, </span>the offering is <span class="gemarra-regular">not accepted. </span>Apparently, even in cases involving the public, performing service in the Temple in a state of impurity is not permitted. This objection is rejected: <span class="gemarra-regular">When that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught, </span>it was with regard to the offering of an <span class="gemarra-regular">individual, </span>where the prohibition of impurity is certainly in effect. 
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a different argument based on that which was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">For</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what does the frontplate </span>worn by the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">effect</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> acceptance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> It effects acceptance <span class="gemarra-regular">for the blood, for the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> flesh, and for the fat </span>of an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">that became</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> impure </span>in the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it became impure <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whether </span>it became impure <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, whether </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">due to</span> circumstances <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond his control or whether </span>it was done <span class="gemarra-regular">willfully</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, whether </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the framework of <span class="gemarra-regular">an individual </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">or whether it was in </span>the framework of <span class="gemarra-regular">a communal</span> offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted in </span>cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">the public, why do I </span>need the frontplate to <span class="gemarra-regular">effect acceptance? </span>If the prohibition of impurity is permitted, no pardon is necessary. 
The Gemara responds that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to you: When </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the frontplate effects </span><span class="gemarra-regular">acceptance </span>it is not referring to the entire list of items cited in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>; it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">individual </span>offering brought in impurity, not to a communal offering. The communal offering is mentioned only in the sense that in that case too, impurity is permitted, albeit for a different reason. Or <span class="gemarra-regular">if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the frontplate effects acceptance for a <span class="gemarra-regular">communal </span>offering, it is only for <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>offerings that <span class="gemarra-regular">lack a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fixed time. </span>Rav Naḥman concedes that with regard to those communal offerings that have no specific time fixed for their sacrifice, the prohibition of performing the service in impurity remains in effect and requires the acceptance effected by the frontplate. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">objection. </span>It is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Aaron will gain forgiveness for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the sin committed in the sacred things </span>that the children of Israel shall hallow in all their sacred gifts, and it shall be always upon his forehead that they may be accepted favorably before the Lord” (Exodus 28:38). <span class="gemarra-regular">And for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which sin does </span>the frontplate <span class="gemarra-regular">gain forgiveness? If </span>it is for <span class="gemarra-regular">the sin of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> an offering disqualified by the intention to sacrifice or eat it after the permitted time, <span class="gemarra-regular">it has already been stated: </span>“And if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is <span class="it-text">piggul</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">it shall not be accepted” </span>(Leviticus 19:7). There is no acceptance of an offering that became <span class="it-text">piggul</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if it is </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the sin of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">notar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>meat of an offering left after the permitted time for eating it passed, <span class="gemarra-regular">it has already been stated: </span>“And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings is eaten on the third day, it shall not be accepted, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither shall it be credited </span>to he who offered it” (Leviticus 7:18). 

Daf 7b

Apparently, the frontplate <span class="gemarra-regular">gains forgiveness only </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the sin </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of impurity, which was exempted from its general </span>prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">the public</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who said that the prohibition of impurity is overridden in cases involving the public, as the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> clearly states that impurity is permitted. The Gemara responds: According to Rav Sheshet, the question of whether the prohibition of impurity is permitted or overridden in cases involving the public <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the subject of <span class="gemarra-regular">a dispute between </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> frontplate effects acceptance whether it is on </span>the High Priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">forehead or whether it is not on </span>the High Priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">forehead </span>when the offering becomes impure. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Shimon. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda says: As long as it is on his forehead </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it effects acceptance; </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it is no longer on his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">forehead it does not effect acceptance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Shimon said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Rabbi Yehuda: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>case of the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">prove </span>that your statement is incorrect, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>on Yom Kippur when the High priest wears only four linen garments the frontplate is <span class="gemarra-regular">no longer on his forehead, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it still <span class="gemarra-regular">effects acceptance. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said to him: Leave </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the High Priest on Yom Kippur, as </span>the atonement of the frontplate is unnecessary because the prohibition of performing the Temple service in <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity is permitted in </span>cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> public. </span>Learn <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon holds that impurity</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is overridden in </span>cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">the public, </span>and that is why the atonement of the frontplate is necessary. The dispute between Rav Sheshet and Rav Naḥman is based on a tannaitic dispute, and the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited above is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.
The Gemara proceeds to analyze the tannaitic dispute between Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yehuda. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the frontplate broke, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">everyone, </span>including Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">agrees that </span>the frontplate<span class="gemarra-regular"> no </span>longer <span class="gemarra-regular">effects acceptance. When they disagree is </span>in a case where the frontplate is not on his forehead but is <span class="gemarra-regular">hanging </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on a peg. Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that the verse: “And it shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">on the forehead </span>of Aaron <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>Aaron <span class="gemarra-regular">shall gain forgiveness </span>for the sin committed in the sacred things” (Exodus 28:38) means that the frontplate atones for sin as long as it is on his forehead. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that emphasis should be placed on the end of that verse: “It shall <span class="gemarra-regular">be always </span>upon his forehead that they may <span class="gemarra-regular">be accepte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before the Lord.” </span>From this, Rabbi Shimon derived that the frontplate always effects acceptance, even when it is not upon the High Priest’s forehead, as <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the meaning of the word <span class="gemarra-regular">always </span>in the verse? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that it means that the frontplate must <span class="gemarra-regular">always </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the High Priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">forehead</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do you find </span>that situation in reality? <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he need to enter the bathroom, </span>when he must remove the frontplate bearing the name of God? Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">doesn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he need to sleep</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> at which time he removes the priestly vestments? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it means that the frontplate <span class="gemarra-regular">always</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> effects acceptance, </span>whether or not it is on his forehead. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Yehuda as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> well, isn’t it written: “Always”? </span>Clearly it does not mean that the frontplate must always be on his forehead. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Always,” </span>teaches that the High Priest must always be aware that the frontplate is on his head, and <span class="gemarra-regular">that he should not be distracted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from it. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabba bar Rav Huna, as Rabba bar Rav Huna said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: A person must touch </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>head and on his arm <span class="gemarra-regular">each and every hour, </span>to maintain awareness of their presence. This is derived by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">from the frontplate: </span>

Daf 8a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the frontplate, which has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">only one mention </span>of God’s name, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah said: </span>“It shall <span class="gemarra-regular">be always upon his forehead,” </span>teaching that <span class="gemarra-regular">that he should not be distracted from it, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries, which have numerous mentions </span>of God’s name in their four passages from the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more </span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> one may not be distracted from them. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Shimon, who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says </span>that the verse: “It shall be always upon his forehead,” teaches that the frontplate <span class="gemarra-regular">effects acceptance </span>even when it is not on the High Priest’s forehead, <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">written: “On his forehead…and shall gain forgiveness”? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to establish the place </span>where the High Priest should position the frontplate, not to indicate that it effects acceptance only when it is on his forehead. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, from where does he </span>derive the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to establish </span>the frontplate’s <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>on the High Priest’s forehead? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He derives it</span> from that which is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“On his forehead.” </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon, too, let him derive </span>the placement of the frontplate from: <span class="gemarra-regular">“On his forehead.” </span>The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, it is indeed so; </span>that is Rabbi Shimon’s source. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>if so, with regard to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“On his forehead…</span><span class="gemarra-regular">and shall gain forgiveness,” what </span>does Rabbi Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">do with</span> that verse? The Gemara responds that Rabbi Shimon could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: </span>The frontplate that is intact and <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for </span>placement on <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>High Priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">forehead effects </span><span class="gemarra-regular">acceptance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is not fit for </span>placement on <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>High Priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">forehead does not effect acceptance. </span>This comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the frontplate broke, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">it does not effect acceptance. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda, from where does he </span>derive the ruling that in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the frontplate broke </span>it does not effect acceptance? The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">He derives it </span>from the fact that the Torah did not say <span class="gemarra-regular">forehead, </span>and instead said <span class="gemarra-regular">his forehead, </span>teaching that it must be fit for the forehead of the High Priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not learn </span>anything from the difference between <span class="gemarra-regular">forehead </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forehead. </span>
§ The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon, who disagree with regard to a case of impurity involving the public, <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>the dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Both </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case of a High Priest prior to Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case of a priest prior to burning the red heifer, on <span class="gemarra-regular">all seven </span>days of his sequestering <span class="gemarra-regular">one sprinkles upon him </span>purification water mixed with ashes from <span class="gemarra-regular">all the </span>previous red heifer <span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offerings that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>safeguarded <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>in the Temple. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi Meir. </span>Since these priests may have become impure with impurity imparted by a corpse at any point prior to their sequestering, one sprinkles the water upon them during all seven days, as there is no certainty which are the third and seventh days. <br><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sprinkles </span>the water <span class="gemarra-regular">upon him only on the third and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seventh </span>days, not on all seven, as sprinkling upon him twice is sufficient to purify him. <br><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> deputy </span>High <span class="gemarra-regular">Priest, says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the priest who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> burns the heifer, one sprinkles </span>the water <span class="gemarra-regular">upon him all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seven </span>days. However, with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yom Kippur, one sprinkles </span>the water <span class="gemarra-regular">upon him only on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the third and seventh </span>days. 
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not with regard to this </span>point that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree? Rabbi Meir holds: </span>The prohibition against performing the Temple service in a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity is overridden</span> in cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">the public. </span>Therefore, one sprinkles the water upon the priest all seven days to ensure purification. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei holds: </span>The prohibition against performing the Temple service in a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity is permitted</span> in cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">the public. </span>Therefore, it may be sufficient to sprinkle the water on the third and the seventh days. 
This suggestion surprises the Gemara: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how can <span class="gemarra-regular">you understand </span>the opinion of Rabbi Yosei in that manner? <span class="gemarra-regular">If Rabbi Yosei holds </span>that impurity imparted by a corpse <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted in </span>cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">the public</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling at all? Rather, </span>it must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone, </span>i.e., both <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that impurity </span>imparted by a corpse <span class="gemarra-regular">is overridden in </span>cases involving <span class="gemarra-regular">the public, </span>and that is why sprinkling is necessary. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And here </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir holds: We say that immersion at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its </span>appointed <span class="gemarra-regular">tim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a mitzva. </span>Beginning with the moment that an impure person is eligible for immersion, whenever he immerses, even if he delays doing so, he is purified. Nevertheless, it is a mitzva to immerse as soon as one is eligible. It is similarly a mitzva to have the purification waters sprinkled as soon as the priest is eligible. Since there is concern that perhaps the High Priest became impure during the three days prior to his sequestering, there is an obligation to sprinkle him each day beginning with day one, since that might be the third day of his impurity. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei holds: We do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not say that immersion at its </span>appointed <span class="gemarra-regular">time is a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva, </span>and the same is true with regard to sprinkling. Therefore, sprinkling on the third and seventh days of his sequestering is sufficient, despite their not necessarily being the third and seventh days of his impurity. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not say that immersion</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at its </span>appointed <span class="gemarra-regular">time is a mitzva? Wasn’t it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">had a </span>sacred <span class="gemarra-regular">name </span>of God <span class="gemarra-regular">written on his flesh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">neither bathe, nor smear oil </span>on his flesh, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor stand in a place of filth. If an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">immersion </span>by means of which he fulfills a <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva happened </span>to present itself <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, he wraps a ree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> over</span> God’s name <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">descends and immerses, </span>allowing the water to penetrate so that there will be no interposition between him and the water. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span>Actually, <span class="gemarra-regular">he descends and immerses in his </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner, </span>and he need not wrap a reed over the name, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he does not rub </span>the spot and erase the name.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we maintain that it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the issue of whether <span class="gemarra-regular">immersion at the </span>appointed <span class="gemarra-regular">time </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzva that they disagree. The first</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds: We do not say that immersion at its</span> appointed <span class="gemarra-regular">time is a mitzva. </span>Therefore, one must wait to immerse until he procures a reed with which to cover God’s name, even if it means delaying the immersion. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei holds: We say that immersion at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>appointed <span class="gemarra-regular">time is a mitzva. </span>Therefore, one must not delay the immersion until he procures a reed but must immerse immediately. The dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei was not based on whether or not immersion on time is a mitzva. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be <span class="gemarra-regular">that everyone </span>agrees that according <span class="gemarra-regular">to these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we say that immersion </span><span class="gemarra-regular">at its </span>appointed <span class="gemarra-regular">time is a mitzva.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here they disagree with regard to this </span>matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds: We equate sprinkling with immersion; </span>just as immersion at its appointed time is a mitzva, so too, sprinkling at its appointed time is a mitzva. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei </span><span class="gemarra-regular">holds: We do not equate sprinkling with immersion; </span>although immersion at its appointed time is a mitzva, sprinkling at its appointed time is not.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina, the deputy </span>High <span class="gemarra-regular">Priest, </span>why does he distinguish between sprinkling purification water on the High Priest before Yom Kippur and doing so to the priest before he burns the red heifer? <span class="gemarra-regular">If he equates sprinkling with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">immersion, </span>then one should sprinkle purification water all seven days <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>High <span class="gemarra-regular">Priest </span>prior to Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he does not equate sprinkling with immersion, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the priest who burns the </span>red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer </span>one would <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sprinkle purification waters all seven days. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, Rabbi Ḥanina, the deputy </span>High <span class="gemarra-regular">Priest, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not equate </span>sprinkling with immersion, and fundamentally, one need not sprinkle purification water all seven days in either case. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">priest who burns the heifer, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">merely </span>established <span class="gemarra-regular">a higher standard. </span>This is one of the many stringencies that the Sages instituted with regard to the priest who burns the heifer in an attempt to underscore that the ritual must be performed in purity. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With whose </span>opinion, among the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> cited above, <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Sages taught, correspond? The only </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between the priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who burns the heifer and the High Priest </span>performing the service <span class="gemarra-regular">on Yom Kippur is </span>

<span class="gemarra-regular">that the sequestering</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of this </span>High Priest prior to Yom Kippur is <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span> the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctity, </span>i.e., to ensure that he appreciates the gravity of the occasion and to fill him with reverence in preparation for entering the Holy of Holies. <span class="gemarra-regular">His brethren, the priests, </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">touch him, </span>as the objective of his sequestering is unrelated to any concern of impurity. In contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">the sequestering of that </span>priest who burns the heifer is <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">purity, and his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brethren, the priests, </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not touch him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> In accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with whose </span>opinion is this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? It is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">either Rabbi Meir or Rabbi Yosei. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">As, if </span>it were in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina, the deputy </span>High <span class="gemarra-regular">Priest, isn’t there also </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>difference between the two priests: One sprinkles purification waters on the priest who burns the heifer all seven days that he is sequestered, whereas one sprinkles purification waters on the High Priest before Yom Kippur only on the third and seventh days? 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, strongly </span><span class="gemarra-regular">objects to </span>the opinion that one sprinkles purification waters on the priest who burns the heifer all seven days because those days may be the third or seventh day of his impurity. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>on the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>day of the seven one sprinkles the water, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the third </span>day of his impurity; and on the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>day of the seven one sprinkles the water, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the third </span>day of his impurity, if he became impure the day before he was sequestered. The same is true for the <span class="gemarra-regular">third </span>day; one sprinkles the water, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">the third </span>day of his impurity. By the same token, on the <span class="gemarra-regular">fifth </span>day one sprinkles the water, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">the seventh </span>day of his impurity if he became impure two days before he was sequestered. On the <span class="gemarra-regular">sixth </span>day one sprinkles the water, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">the seventh </span>day of his impurity if he became impure the day before he was sequestered. On the <span class="gemarra-regular">seventh </span>day one sprinkles the water, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">the seventh </span>day of his impurity.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>on the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourth </span>day after he was sequestered, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>require <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling at all? Neither with regard to </span>the possibility that it may be the <span class="gemarra-regular">third </span>day of his impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">is there uncertainty, </span>since he has already been sequestered for three days, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor with regard to </span>the possibility that it may be the <span class="gemarra-regular">seventh </span>day of his impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">is there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty, </span>as even if it were, sprinkling would be useless because he did not have purification water sprinkled on him on the third day of his impurity. Nothing is accomplished by sprinkling the water on the priest on the fourth day. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to your reasoning, is there </span>ever <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling </span>on the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">all seven </span>days? <span class="gemarra-regular">Don’t we maintain that sprinkling is</span> prohibited by <span class="gemarra-regular">rabbinic decre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> issued to enhance the character of Shabbat as a day of rest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore, sprinkling <span class="gemarra-regular">does not override Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rather, what have you to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say? </span>When it was instituted to sprinkle the water on the priest, it was for <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>days <span class="gemarra-regular">except for Shabbat.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Here too, </span>say that sprinkling is performed for <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>days <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourth </span>day of sequestering. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Therefore, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the High Priest on Yom Kippur, </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> matter </span>of the beginning of the seven-day period <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not dependent on us; rather, the matter is dependent on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the determination of the </span>first day of the new <span class="gemarra-regular">month</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>for that reason it is <span class="gemarra-regular">required to remove </span>the High Priest from his home <span class="gemarra-regular">on the third of Tishrei, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whenever the third of Tishrei occurs </span>on a weekday, <span class="gemarra-regular">we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> remove him </span>from his house. Therefore, both on the fourth day of his sequestering and on Shabbat, no sprinkling is performed. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">priest who burns </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the heifer, </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter </span>of the beginning of the seven-day period <span class="gemarra-regular">is dependent on us, we remove him </span>from his home <span class="gemarra-regular">on the fourth day of the week, </span>Wednesday, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that the fourth day of his </span>sequestering <span class="gemarra-regular">will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">occur on Shabbat. </span>In that way, sprinkling will not be performed only one day of the seven, as the day on which sprinkling is prohibited will coincide with the day on which sprinkling is unnecessary. 
§ Having discussed the obligation to sequester the High Priest prior to Yom Kippur, the Gemara interprets the next matter in the mishna: The High Priest is removed from his house <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Chamber of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Parhedrin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. It was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>said: <span class="gemarra-regular">And was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>called <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Parhedrin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the chamber for the annual royal appointees? <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it </span>called <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber of</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">Balvatei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the chamber for ministers and council heads? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, initially, </span>during the era of Shimon HaTzaddik and his colleagues, who were rewarded with long lives due to their righteousness, <span class="gemarra-regular">they would call it the Chamber of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Balvatei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a term connoting significance, since it was a place designated for the High Priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, because </span>people were <span class="gemarra-regular">giving money </span>in order to be appointed <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>High <span class="gemarra-regular">Priesthood, </span>the position was filled by unworthy individuals. Due to their wickedness, they did not survive the year, and they were <span class="gemarra-regular">replaced </span><span class="gemarra-regular">every twelve month</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">parhedrin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who are replaced every</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> twelve months</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Therefore, the chamber was called </span>disparagingly the Chamber of <span class="gemarra-italic">Parhedrin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Since the High Priest was replaced every year, the new appointee would renovate the chamber to reflect his own more elaborate tastes. 
Apropos the <span class="it-text">Parhedrin</span> chamber, the Gemara discusses a related <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>in tractate <span class="it-text">Demai</span>: With regard to doubtfully tithed produce, i.e., produce purchased from an <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span> with regard to whom there is uncertainty whether or not he tithed the produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sages required baker</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to separate only </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the tithe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is one one-hundredth of the produce that is given to the priests, and <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>separated from the dough and given to priests. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">gedola</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is equal to approximately one-fiftieth of the produce and is given to a priest, need <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be separated from doubtfully-tithed produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: 

Daf 9a

This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>Yoḥanan the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>emissaries <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout all the </span>areas located within the <span class="gemarra-regular">borders of </span><span class="it-text">Eretz</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">Yisrael</span> to assess the situation <span class="gemarra-regular">and saw that </span>the people <span class="gemarra-regular">were separating only </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">gedol</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> and were neglecting to separate tithes. Therefore, he issued a decree that anyone who purchases produce from an <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span> must be concerned about the possibility that it was not tithed and is required to tithe it. Since even an <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span> separates <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="it-text">gedola</span>, the bakers who purchased grain from them were not required to do so. 
And granted, bakers need not separate <span class="gemarra-regular">first tithe and poor man’s tith</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> due to the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">The burden of proof rests upon the claimant. </span>Neither first tithe, given to Levites, nor poor man’s tithe, given to the poor, is sacred. It is merely the property of the Levite and the pauper, respectively. Since with regard to doubtfully tithed produce, by definition, there is no certainty that one is actually required to tithe it, if the Levite or the pauper should seek to take possession of the gifts, they must first prove that in fact the produce was not tithed. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">second tithe, </span>why are the bakers exempt? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let them separat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> second-tithe from the produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">take it up </span>to Jerusalem, <span class="gemarra-regular">and eat it in Jerusalem, </span>which is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to anyone else who purchases doubtfully tithed produce.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">parhedrin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>government appointees, <span class="gemarra-regular">beat </span>the bakers throughout the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire twelve </span><span class="gemarra-regular">months </span>of their tenure <span class="gemarra-regular">and tell them: Sell </span>your baked goods <span class="gemarra-regular">cheaply, sell </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">cheaply. </span>Since the officers insist that the bakers refrain from raising their prices, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">burden them </span>with the exertion of separating second tithe from a large quantity of grain and taking it to Jerusalem, as they would be unable to raise their prices to cover the cost of the lost grain and the trip to Jerusalem. Since the presumptive status of the grain is that it was tithed, and the obligation to tithe doubtfully tithed produce is a stringency, the Sages exempted the baker from the obligation to do so. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-italic">parhedrin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>These are royal <span class="gemarra-regular">appointees [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pursei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> charged with performance of different tasks.
§ Apropos the Second Temple period, when High Priests were frequently replaced, the Gemara cites that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written: “The fear of the Lord prolongs days, but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the years of the wicked will be shortened” </span>(Proverbs 10:27)? <span class="gemarra-regular">The fear of the Lord prolongs days; that </span>is a reference to the <span class="gemarra-regular">First Temple, which stood </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hundred and ten years and in </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">only eighteen High </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> served, </span>as is written in the lists of the genealogy of the priests in the Bible. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But the years of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wicked will be shortened; that </span>is a reference to the <span class="gemarra-regular">Second Temple, which stood </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">four hundred and twenty years </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and in </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">over three hundred High Priests served. </span>In calculating the tenures of the High Priests, <span class="gemarra-regular">deduct from </span>the figure of four hundred and twenty years <span class="gemarra-regular">forty years that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon HaTzaddik served, and eighty </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">that Yoḥanan the High</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Priest served</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ten </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">that Yishmael ben Pavi served</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and some say eleven </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Elazar ben Ḥarsum</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> served. </span>These men were all righteous and were privileged to serve extended terms. After deducting those one hundred and thirty or one hundred and forty-one years, <span class="gemarra-regular">go out and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> calculate from this </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">forward </span>and conclude: <span class="gemarra-regular">Each and every</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>of the remaining High Priests <span class="gemarra-regular">did not complete his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> year </span>in office, as the number of remaining High Priests is greater than the number of years remaining. 
§ Apropos the sins of the High Priests in the Second Temple, the Gemara cites that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Torta said: Due to what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>the Tabernacle in <span class="gemarra-regular">Shil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">oh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> destroyed </span>in the time of the prophet Samuel? It was destroyed <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that there were two matters </span>that existed <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the Tabernacle: <span class="gemarra-regular">Forbidden sexual relations and degradation </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated items. </span>There were <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden sexual relations, as it is written: “Now Eli</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was very old and he heard what his sons were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> doing to all of Israel, how they lay with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> women who did service at the opening of the Tent</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Meeting” </span>(I Samuel 2:22). <span class="gemarra-regular">And although Rabbi Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Naḥmani said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone who says </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that the sons of Eli sinned </span>by engaging in forbidden sexual relations <span class="gemarra-regular">is nothing other than mistaken, </span>even according to the alternative interpretation of the verse that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the fact 

Daf 9b

<span class="gemarra-regular">that they deferred</span> the sacrifice of <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>bird-offerings by women after childbirth; <span class="gemarra-regular">nevertheless, the verse ascribes to them as if they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lay </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">them. </span>These women came to the Tabernacle to sacrifice doves or pigeons as bird-offerings as part of their purification process, which would permit them to engage in sexual relations with their husbands. Eli’s sons delayed the sacrifice of these offerings and thereby delayed the return of these women to their husbands and their fulfillment of the mitzva of procreation. Even though, according to this opinion, Eli’s sons did not actually engage in sexual relations with these women, the verse attributes that degree of severity to their conduct.
Eli’s sons also sinned in the <span class="gemarra-regular">degradation</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of consecrated items, as it is written: “Before the fat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was made burned, the priest’s servant came and said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the man who sacrificed: Hand over some flesh to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> roast for the priest, for he will not take cooked</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> flesh from you, but raw. And if the man said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: Let the fat be burnt first and then</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> take as much as you want, then he would say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: No, hand it over right now, or I will take</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it by force. The sin of the young men against</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Lord was very great, for the men treated the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lord’s offerings with contempt” </span>(I Samuel 2:15–17). 
§ The <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> continues with a discussion of the sins of the Jewish people over the generations: <span class="gemarra-regular">Due to what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">First Temple destroyed? </span>It was destroyed <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that there were three </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matters </span>that existed <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the First Temple: <span class="gemarra-regular">Idol worship, forbidden</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sexual relations, and bloodshed. Idol worship, as it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “The bed is too shor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for stretching [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mehistare’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>and the cover is too narrow for gathering” (Isaiah 28:20). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The bed is too short</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for stretching?” Rabbi Yonatan said: This bed is too </span><span class="gemarra-regular">short for two counterparts [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">re’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to dominate [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mehistarer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span><span class="it-text">Mehistare’a</span> is a contraction of <span class="it-text">mehistarer</span> <span class="it-text">re’im</span>. It is inconceivable that there would be in one Temple both service of God and worship of the idol placed there by King Manasseh. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cover [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vehamasseikha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is too narrow [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] for gathering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kehitkannes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]? Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel bar Naḥmani said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rabbi Yonatan reached this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse, he wept </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: For He about Whom it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written: “He gathers [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kones</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] waters of the sea together </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as a heap” </span>(Psalms 33:7), <span class="gemarra-regular">the idol [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">masseikha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] became a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rival [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]? </span>In the homiletic interpretation, <span class="it-text">masseikha</span> is interpreted as idol and <span class="it-text">tzara</span> is interpreted as rival, as in the term used to describe the relationship between two women married to the same husband, <span class="it-text">isha</span> <span class="it-text">tzara</span>. 
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden sexual relations, it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: “The Lord says because the daughters of Zion are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> haughty and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their feet” </span>(Isaiah 3:16). <br><span class="gemarra-regular">Because the daughters of Zion </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are haughty, </span>indicates a <span class="gemarra-regular">tall </span>woman walking <span class="gemarra-regular">alongside </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">short</span> one so that the tall woman would stand out. <br><span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> walk with outstretched necks, </span>indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">that they would walk with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upright stature </span>and carry themselves in an immodest way. <br><span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wanton eyes, </span>indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">that they would fill their eyes with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blue eye shadow </span>in order to draw attention to their eyes. <br><span class="gemarra-regular">Walking and mincing as they go, </span>indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">that they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would walk </span>in small steps, <span class="gemarra-regular">heel to toe, </span>so onlookers would notice them. <br><span class="gemarra-regular">Making a tinkling [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">te’akasna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] with their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> feet, Rabbi Yitzḥak said: </span>This teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that they would bring</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> myrrh and balsam and place </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in their shoes </span>and would walk in the marketplaces of Jerusalem. <span class="gemarra-regular">And once they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> approached </span>a place where <span class="gemarra-regular">young Jewish men </span>were congregated, <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would stamp </span>their feet on the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">and splash </span>the perfume <span class="gemarra-regular">toward them and instill the evil inclination into them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like venom of a viper [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ke’eres</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">bikhos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">].</span>
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">bloodshed it is written: “Moreover, Manasseh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shed innocent blood very much, until he had filled Jerusalem</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from one end to another” </span>(II Kings 21:16). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>considering that the people during <span class="gemarra-regular">the Second Temple </span>period <span class="gemarra-regular">were engaged in Torah </span>study, observance of <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot, and acts of kindness, </span>and that they did not perform the sinful acts that were performed in the First Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">why was </span>the Second Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">destroyed? </span>It was destroyed <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that there was wanton </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hatred </span>during that period. This comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to teach you that</span> the sin of <span class="gemarra-regular">wanton hatred is equivalent to the three</span> severe <span class="gemarra-regular">transgressions: Idol worship, forbidden sexual relations and bloodshed. </span>
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">They were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wicked</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> however, they put their faith in the Holy</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> One, Blessed be He. </span>With that statement <span class="gemarra-regular">we have come</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">First Temple </span>era, about <span class="gemarra-regular">which it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “Her chiefs judge for bribes, her priests give rulings for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a fee, and her prophets divine for pay; yet they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rely on the Lord, saying: The Lord is in our</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> midst, no tragedy will overtake us” </span>(Micah 3:11). At least the final portion of the verse was to their credit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, the Holy One, Blessed be He, brought upon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them three decrees corresponding to their three wicked sins, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated: “Therefore, due to you Zion will be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">plowed as a field, Jerusalem will become heaps of ruins, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the Temple Mount will be a like shrine in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the woods” </span>(Micah 3:12). 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And in the First Temple </span>era <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">no baseless hatred? Isn’t it written: </span>“Cry and wail, son of man, for this will befall my people, this will befall all the princes of Israel: <span class="gemarra-regular">They will be cast before the sword together with my </span><span class="gemarra-regular">people, therefore strike the thigh” </span>(Ezekiel 21:17)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer </span>interpreted this verse and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: These are people who eat and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> drink with each other, and stab each other with verbal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> barbs. </span>Apparently, even those who were close were filled with hatred toward one another. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>behavior <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>found only among <span class="gemarra-regular">the princes of Israel, as it is written: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Cry and wail, son of man, for this will befall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">my people”; and it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Cry</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and wail, son of man, </span>for this will befall my people”; one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that this unsavory trait was common <span class="gemarra-regular">to all. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “This will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">befall all the princes of Israel.” </span>It was only the leaders of the nation who harbored baseless hatred for each other; the people of the nation as a whole did not hate one another. 
§ It was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar who both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the former, </span>the people in the First Temple era, <span class="gemarra-regular">whose sin was exposed </span>and no attempt was made to disguise their conduct, the <span class="gemarra-regular">end </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>punishment <span class="gemarra-regular">was exposed, </span>and the prophet informed them that they would return to their land in seventy years. In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter, </span>the people in the Second Temple era, <span class="gemarra-regular">whose sin was not exposed; </span>rather, they attempted to disguise their conduct, the <span class="gemarra-regular">end </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>punishment <span class="gemarra-regular">was not exposed. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The fingernails of the former </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are preferable to the bell</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the latter. Reish Lakish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to him: On the contrary, the latter were superior</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; even though there is subjugation by the kingdoms, they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> engaged in Torah study. </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Reish Lakish: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Temple will prove </span>that the former were superior, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">restored to the former. </span>The Second Temple was constructed after the destruction of the first. However, after the destruction of the Second Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">not restored </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the latter. </span>Apparently, the former were superior to the latter. 
Similarly, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">asked Rabbi Elazar: Are the former </span><span class="gemarra-regular">greater or are the latter greater? He said to them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Look to the Temple </span>and see if it has been restored, as it was to our predecessors. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>the exchange was slightly different: <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: The Temple</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is your witness</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The restoration of the Temple after the destruction of the First Temple, attests to the fact that the former generation was greater. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish was swimming in the Jordan Rive</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> when <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana came and gave him a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> han</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to help him out. Reish Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: My God! I hate you </span>Babylonians, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written: “If she be a wal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we will build a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> silver turret upon her, if she be a doo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">we will cover her with boards of cedar” </span>(Song of Songs 8:9). This is the meaning of the verse as it applies to the Jewish people: <span class="gemarra-regular">Had you rendered yourselves</span> a solid bloc <span class="gemarra-regular">like a wall and all ascended </span>to Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">in the days of Ezra, you would have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> been likened to silver, which rot does not infest, </span>in the sense that you would have merited experiencing the Divine Presence in all its glory. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now that you ascended </span><span class="gemarra-regular">like doors, </span>and only some of you came to Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">you are likened to cedar, which rot infests, </span>and you merit experiencing only partial revelation of the Divine Presence. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span> rot infests <span class="gemarra-regular">cedar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ulla said: It is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sasmagor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a type of worm. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does <span class="gemarra-italic">sasmagor</span> have to do with the Divine Presence during the Second Temple era? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said: </span>Just as little remains from a cedar tree infested by this worm, similarly, all that remained from the Divine Presence during the Second Temple period was a <span class="gemarra-regular">Divine Voice, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">After the last prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> died, the Divine Spirit </span>of prophetic revelation <span class="gemarra-regular">departed from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Jewish people, and they were still utilizing a Divine Voice</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which they heard as an echo of prophecy. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And would Reish Lakish speak with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabba bar bar Ḥana </span>in public? <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as Rabbi Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who was the master of Eretz Yisrael </span>in wisdom and character, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish would not speak with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> in public, as Reish Lakish was sparing in his speech and extended friendship to only a select few prominent, righteous people, to the extent that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whom Reish Lakish </span>was seen <span class="gemarra-regular">speaking in the marketplace, one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would give him </span>a loan and <span class="gemarra-regular">do business </span>with him <span class="gemarra-regular">without witnesses; </span>would he <span class="gemarra-regular">have spoken with Rabba bar bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥana? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Cast</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a man between them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and say that the incident did not involve Reish Lakish and Rabba bar bar Ḥana. It <span class="gemarra-regular">was either Reish Lakish </span>bathing in the river <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ze’iri, </span>the prominent Babylonian Sage, who extended him a hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana </span>who was in the river <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Elazar </span>extended a hand to him. In any event, <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the Sage who heard what Reish Lakish said <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>and related it, Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: That is not the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reason; even had they all ascended in the days of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ezra, the Divine Presence would not have rested in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Second Temple, as it is written: “God will enlarge Japheth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and dwell in the tents of Shem” </span>(Genesis 9:27). 

Daf 10a

The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Although God will enlarge Japheth, </span>referring to the Persians, who descended from Japheth and who assisted in constructing the Second Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Divine Presence rests only in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the tents of Shem, </span>in the First Temple, which was built by King Solomon without the patronage of a foreign power. 
§ The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where do we </span>derive that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Persians descend from Japheth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “The sons of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Japheth were Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Tuval and Meshech and Tiras” </span>(Genesis 10:2). The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Gomer, that is Germamya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Magog, that is Kandiya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Madai, that is Macedonia; Javan, in accordance with its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">plain meaning, </span>Greece; <span class="gemarra-regular">Tuval, that is </span>the nation called <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Unaiki</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meshech, that is Musya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Tiras, Rabbi Simai and the Rabbis disagree, and some say </span>the dispute is between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Simon and the Rabbis: One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: That is Beit Teraiki</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one said: That </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is Persia. </span>According to that approach, Persia is listed among the descendants of Japheth. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef taught: Tiras is Persia</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
The list of nations continues: “And <span class="gemarra-regular">Sabtah and Raamah and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sabteca</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Genesis 10:7). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>These are <span class="gemarra-regular">the inner Sakista</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the outer Sakistan. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Between one and the other </span>there was a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred parasangs, and the circumference </span>of the land was <span class="gemarra-regular">one thousand parasangs.</span>
The Gemara continues interpreting the verses. It is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the beginning of his kingdom was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, </span>in the land of Shinar” (Genesis 10:10). <span class="gemarra-regular">Babel in accordance with its plain</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> meaning, </span>Babylonia; <span class="gemarra-regular">Erech, that is </span>the city known then as <span class="gemarra-regular">Orikhut; and Accad, that is </span>the place known then as <span class="gemarra-regular">Baskar; Calneh, that is Nofer Ninefi.</span>
The Torah continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Out of that land went forth Asshur” </span>(Genesis 10:11). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef taught: Asshur, that is Silek</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning that is the region where the town Silkiya was built. <span class="gemarra-regular">“And built Nineveh and Rehoboth-ir and Calah” </span>(Genesis 10:11). <span class="gemarra-regular">Nineveh, in accordance with its plain meaning; Rehovoth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-ir, that is </span>the town later known as <span class="gemarra-regular">Perat of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meishan; Calah, that is Perat of Bursif. “And Resen between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Nineveh and Calah, it is the great city” </span>(Genesis 10:12). <span class="gemarra-regular">Resen, that is </span>the town later known as <span class="gemarra-regular">Akteisfon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> It is the great city; I do not know </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>this means that <span class="gemarra-regular">Nineveh </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the great city, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it means that <span class="gemarra-regular">Resen </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the great city. When </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it says: “And Nineveh was a great city of God, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a three-day journey across” </span>(Jonah 3:3), <span class="gemarra-regular">you must </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Nineveh is the great city. </span>
The Gemara continues to discuss the interpretation of names in the Bible. The Torah says: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And there were Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">children of Anak” </span>(Numbers 13:22). <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught: Ahiman </span>was so called because he was the greatest and most <span class="gemarra-regular">skillful</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">meyuman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of his brothers. </span>Ahiman is a contraction of brother [<span class="it-text">aḥ</span>] and right [<span class="it-text">yamin</span>], which is the skilled hand. <span class="gemarra-regular">Sheshai</span> was so called because <span class="gemarra-regular">he renders the ground like pits</span> [<span class="gemarra-italic">sheḥitot</span>] with his strides. <span class="gemarra-regular">Talmai </span>was so called because <span class="gemarra-regular">he renders the ground </span>filled with <span class="gemarra-regular">furrows [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">telamim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> with his strides. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively: Ahiman built </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Anat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; Sheshai built </span>the town <span class="gemarra-regular">Alush; Talmai built </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Talbush. The children of Anak </span>is referring to the fact that it appears <span class="gemarra-regular">that the sun is a necklace [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shema</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’anikin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>around their necks because of <span class="gemarra-regular">their height.</span>
§ Apropos the opinion that Tiras is Persia, the Gemara addresses a related matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Levi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Rome is destined</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to fall into the hands of Persia, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: “Now hear the plan that the Lord has devised</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for Edom, and the thoughts He has considered for the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> residents of Teiman. Surely the youngest of the flock will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> drag them away, surely their habitation will be appalled due</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to them” </span>(Jeremiah 49:20). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Ulla strongly objected </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to this. </span>From <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>may it be <span class="gemarra-regular">inferred that this </span>phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">Youngest of the flock, is Persia? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “The ram that you saw sporting two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">horns are the kings of Media and Persia” </span>(Daniel 8:20), and the ram is a member of the flock mentioned in the verse. Still, how is that proof? <span class="gemarra-regular">And say</span> that youngest of the flock refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">Greece, </span>who will overthrow Rome, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “The goat is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the king of Greece” </span>(Daniel 8:21). The goat, too, could be characterized as a member of the flock. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Ḥaviva bar Surmakei ascended </span>from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">he stated </span>this difficulty <span class="gemarra-regular">before a certain one of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages. </span>That Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: One who does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not know how to interpret verses </span>is so arrogant that he <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection to </span>the opinion of the great <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi? Indeed, Rabba bar Ulla misunderstood the basis of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s interpretation. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">The youngest of the flock? </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">the youngest of the brothers, </span>a reference to Persia, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yosef taught: Tiras, </span>the youngest of Japheth’s sons, <span class="gemarra-regular">that is Persia. </span>
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Elai: Rome is destined to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fall into the hands of Persia. </span>This is derived by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as the First</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Temple, that the descendants of Shem built it and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Chaldeans destroyed it, </span>and in turn <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chaldeans, </span>ruled by Belshazzar, <span class="gemarra-regular">fell to Persians, </span>ruled by Darius the Mede and his son-in-law Cyrus the Persian; <span class="gemarra-regular">the Second Temple</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, that the Persians built it and the Romans destroyed it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, is it not right that the Romans will fall into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the hands of the Persians? </span>
In contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: Persia is destined to fall into the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hands of Rome. Rav Kahana and Rav Asi, </span>Rav’s students, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rav: The builders </span>will fall <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the hands of the destroyers? </span>Is that justice? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to them: </span>Although it seems unjust, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, that is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">King’s decree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">to them: They, too, are destroyers of synagogues, </span>and they are no better than the Romans. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">That was also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Persia is destined to fall into the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hands of Rome. One </span>reason is that <span class="gemarra-regular">they destroyed synagogues. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, it is the King’s decree that the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">builders </span>will fall <span class="gemarra-regular">into the hands of the destroyers, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: The son of David </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will come only when the wicked kingdom of Rome spreads </span>its dominance <span class="gemarra-regular">throughout the world for nine months, as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is stated: “Therefore He will give them up until she </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who is to bear has borne; then the remnants of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his brethren will return with the children of Israel” </span>(Micah 5:2). The duration of Rome’s rule over the world will be the duration of a pregnancy, nine months.
§ The Gemara resumes the discussion of the High Priest’s relocation to the <span class="it-text">Parhedrin</span> chamber. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Rabbis taught: None of the chambers in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Temple had a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> except for the Chamber of</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">Parhedrin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, in which there was a place of residence of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the High Priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Only residences in which one sleeps require a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>, and the only chamber in the Temple that fits that description was the <span class="it-text">Parhedrin</span> chamber. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>That is not the reason; after all, <span class="gemarra-regular">weren’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t there several chambers in the Temple in which there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was a place of residence </span>designated for priests to sit and sleep, and yet <span class="gemarra-regular">they did not have a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Parhedrin</span> was there because there <span class="gemarra-regular">was a </span>rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> that there was no fundamental obligation to affix a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> in the <span class="it-text">Parhedrin</span> chamber, and that one was affixed there due to a decree? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda holds: </span>The legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">any house that is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not designated </span>for residence both <span class="gemarra-regular">for the summer and for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the rainy season is not </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a house </span>and therefore does not require a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised an objection </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>opinion from a verse. How could you suggest that the legal status of a residence occupied for only part of the year is not that of a house? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it written: “I will strike the winter-house</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with the summer-house” </span>(Amos 3:15)? Apparently, even a residence occupied only half the year is a house. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>A residence occupied only part of the year may be <span class="gemarra-regular">called the winter-house or the summer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-house. It is not called a house </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unmodified</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>A house is a structure used year round. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">objection to </span>the opinion of Rava, from a mishna: If one brought produce from the field into <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> that he constructed for <span class="gemarra-regular">the festival </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on the festival </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda obligates </span>him to tithe the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis exempt </span>him from tithing the produce. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it was taught concerning </span>the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda obligates </span>the owner of that <span class="it-text">sukka</span> to include the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">joining </span>of courtyards, like any of the houses in the courtyard; <span class="gemarra-regular">and in </span>the mitzva of affixing a <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span> in the <span class="it-text">sukka</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and in </span>separating <span class="gemarra-regular">tithes </span>from produce brought into the <span class="it-text">sukka</span>. One is obligated to tithe his produce only when its processing has been completed. When he brings the produce into the house, he is obligated to tithe it. Rabbi Yehuda holds that the legal status of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, in which one resides for a mere seven days, is that of a house in terms of the mitzva of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that Rabbi Yehuda rules that <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law </span>the status of the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> is like that of a house, but that by Torah law his opinion is consistent with Rava’s opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">granted, </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">joining </span>of courtyards <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is </span>possible <span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>that the obligation is <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law; however, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">tithes, is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>possible <span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>that according to Rabbi Yehuda the obligation is <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law? </span>

Daf 10b

In that case, there is the concern <span class="gemarra-regular">lest one come to separate </span>tithes <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the obligated </span>produce to fulfill the obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">for the exempt</span> produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">or from the exempt </span>produce to fulfill the obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">for the obligated </span>produce. Produce that one is obligated to tithe by rabbinic law has the status of exempt produce by Torah law. Since it is difficult to distinguish between produce that one is obligated to tithe by Torah law and produce that one is obligated to tithe by rabbinic law, one might seek to fulfill his obligation by separating tithes from one for the other. In both cases, both the produce designated as a tithe and the produce for which it was tithed would retain the status of untithed produce. Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda could not have said that a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> is considered a house by rabbinic law. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Abaye said: </span>The dispute with regard to the <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> in the <span class="it-text">Parhedrin</span> chamber must be explained differently. <span class="gemarra-regular">During </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>days that the High Priest lives in the <span class="it-text">Parhedrin</span> chamber during his sequestering, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees that </span>the chamber is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>in the mitzva to affix a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> there. <span class="gemarra-regular">When</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they disagree </span>is with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the rest of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> days of the year, </span>when no one resides there. <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis hold: We issue a decree </span>and require that a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> be affixed during the rest of the year <span class="gemarra-regular">due</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>days that the High Priest lives there; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Yehuda holds: We do not issue </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">decree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and there is no obligation to affix a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> to the chamber the rest of the year. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him: But isn’t it taught</span> in the mishna cited above: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> that he constructed for <span class="gemarra-regular">the festival </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on the festival </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>? Apparently, contrary to the opinion of Abaye, the dispute is whether or not there is an obligation to affix a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> to the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> during the Festival itself. If, as Abaye said, the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> agree that there is an obligation to affix a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> during the festival of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> even though it is used for only a brief period, on what basis do the Rabbis rule that there is no obligation even on the Festival itself? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: During the rest of the days</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the year, everyone agrees that </span>the <span class="it-text">Parhedrin</span> chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exempt </span>from the obligation to affix a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> there. <span class="gemarra-regular">When</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they disagree </span>is with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>days that the High Priest lives there, and with regard to a <span class="it-text">sukka</span> during the Festival. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in order to resolve the contradiction between the opinions about the obligation of the chamber and of the <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, the Gemara asserts: With regard to the <span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the reason is discrete, and </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">chamber the reason is discrete.</span>
The Gemara explains: With regard to <span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the reason is discrete. Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>In order to fulfill the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> require a </span>well-built <span class="gemarra-regular">permanent residence. </span>A permanent residence is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated in </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. The Rabbis </span>conform <span class="gemarra-regular">to their </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as they say: </span>In order to fulfill the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, we require a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">temporary residence, </span>not a full-fledged house. A temporary residence is <span class="gemarra-regular">not obligated in </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">chamber, the reason </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is discrete. The Rabbis hold: A residence </span>in which one resides <span class="gemarra-regular">involuntaril</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">considered a residence. </span>Although the High Priest resides in the <span class="it-text">Parhedrin</span> chamber due to a mitzva and not of his own volition, its legal status is that of a residence and a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> must be affixed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda holds: A residence </span>in which one resides <span class="gemarra-regular">involuntarily is not considered a residence. </span>Therefore, there should be no obligation to affix a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> in the <span class="it-text">Parhedrin</span> chamber, just as there is no obligation to do so in the other Temple chambers in which priests reside. However, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted </span>this obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law so that </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">will not say: The High Priest is imprisoned in jail</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as only in substandard residences that appear unfit for residence is there no obligation to affix a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">As the Sages taught: </span>

Daf 11a

<span class="gemarra-regular">All the gates that were there </span>on the east side of the Temple courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">did not have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> except for the Gate of Nicanor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>in the courtyard just <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the gate was <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Parhedrin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in which there is an obligation to affix a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>. Therefore, a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> was affixed to the gate as well. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis and not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, as, if </span>it were in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>a difficulty arises. The principle is that decrees are issued only to prevent violation of a Torah prohibition. The fact that a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> was affixed to the <span class="it-text">Parhedrin</span> chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">itself </span>is due to a rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree, and will we </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">proceed to issue</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a decree </span>to affix a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> on the gate before the chamber in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>prevent violation of the existing <span class="gemarra-regular">decree? </span>The Gemara rejects this reasoning: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>it is not difficult, as the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire</span> obligation to affix the <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> on both the chamber and the gate is the result of <span class="gemarra-regular">a single decree. </span>
§ Apropos the <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> in the High Priest’s chamber, the Gemara discusses other <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sages taught </span>with regard to the verse: “And you will write them upon the doorposts of your houses and <span class="gemarra-regular">upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your gates” </span>(Deuteronomy 6:9): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the gates </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of houses, and the gates of courtyards</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gates of cities</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the gates of towns, all </span>of them are <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mitzva </span>of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> in that <span class="gemarra-regular">place, due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is stated:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “And you will write the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon the doorposts of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your houses and upon your gates.</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Safra: </span>If there is an obligation to affix a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> on city gates, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>city <span class="gemarra-regular">gates [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">abbulei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Meḥoza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a city with a Jewish majority, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages did not affix</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on them? </span>Rav Safra <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Those</span> gates are not the city gates. They are <span class="gemarra-regular">made as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reinforcement to the fort [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">akra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of turrets </span>above the gate, and therefore no <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> is required. Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: And shouldn’t the fort of turrets itself require</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, since </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">is a residence for the prison</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> guard in </span>the fort? <span class="gemarra-regular">As, wasn’t </span>a similar case <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A synagogue in which there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is a residence for the synagogue attendant requires a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Although no one lives in the synagogue itself, since the attendant lives in an adjacent room, the synagogue requires a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Abaye said: </span>The reason that no <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> was affixed there was <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">danger </span>involved. The gates of a city populated by Jews certainly require a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>; however, since gentiles live there as well, the danger is that the gentiles would suspect the Jews of witchcraft or espionage, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span> belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">an individual is examined twice every seven</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> years </span>to determine whether it was stolen or became disqualified. And in order to avoid excessive burden on the community, the <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">the publi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">c</span> is examined <span class="gemarra-regular">twice </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in a </span>fifty-year <span class="gemarra-regular">Jubilee </span>period. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda said: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident </span>involving <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">examiner [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">artavin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who was examining </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mezuzot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the upper </span><span class="gemarra-regular">marketplace of Tzippori </span>during a period when decrees were issued against the Jewish people, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span>Roman <span class="gemarra-regular">official [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kasdor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">found him and collected </span>a fine of <span class="gemarra-regular">one thousand </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zuz</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from him. </span>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">those on the path to perform </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzva are not </span>susceptible to <span class="gemarra-regular">harm </span>throughout the process of performing the mitzva? The Gemara responds: In a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where danger is permanent it is different, </span>as one should not rely on a miracle, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written </span>with regard to God’s command to Samuel to anoint David as king in place of Saul: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Samuel said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">How will I go, and Saul will hear and kill </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me; and God said: Take in your hand a calf </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and say: I have come to offer a sacrifice to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">God” </span>(I Samuel 16:2). Even when God Himself issues the command, there is concern with regard to a clear and present danger.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Yehuda: A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> storehouse for hay, and a cattle barn, and a woodshed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and a storehous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are exempt from </span>the obligation of <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the women make use </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of them. And what </span>is the meaning of the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Make use? </span>It means that the women <span class="gemarra-regular">bathe </span>in them. Since women bathe there unclothed, it is inappropriate to affix a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> there. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said to him: The reason</span> that there is no requirement to affix a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> there is due to the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>women <span class="gemarra-regular">bathe </span>there; one can learn by inference <span class="gemarra-regular">that standard </span>buildings of this kind, where women do not bathe, <span class="gemarra-regular">are obligated </span>in the mitzva of affixing a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> there. <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it taught</span> in a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A cattle barn is exempt from</span> the obligation of <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>unrelated to whether or not women bathe there? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the term should be understood otherwise. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Make</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> use? </span>It means that the women <span class="gemarra-regular">adorn </span>themselves there, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>is what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: Although </span>these structures are solid and clean to the extent that <span class="gemarra-regular">the women</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> adorn themselves in them, they are exempt </span>from the obligation of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> since they are not residences. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Are you saying that structures where <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">women adorn themselves are exempt </span>from the mitzva of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it taught </span>in a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cattle stable is exempt from </span>the obligation of <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and a barn <span class="gemarra-regular">in which women adorn themselves is obligated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what have you to say, </span>that with regard to the requirement of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> the status of places where <span class="gemarra-regular">women </span><span class="gemarra-regular">adorn themselves is </span>subject to a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Just as there are different opinions in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">in my </span>opinion, the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">standard </span>cattle barns <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>subject to a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that it is written: Upon the doorposts <span class="gemarra-regular">of your house, </span>meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">your house </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">designated </span>as a residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">to the exclusion of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> storehouse for hay, and a cattle barn, and a woodshed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and a storehouse, which are exempt from </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and some obligate </span>these structures in the mitzva of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>. Apparently, the Rabbis dispute the requirement of affixing a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> in a standard stable. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Actually</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they said: </span>There is a legal tradition that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">building </span>housing <span class="gemarra-regular">a bathroom, and a building </span>housing <span class="gemarra-regular">a tannery [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">burseki</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a bathhouse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a building </span>housing a ritual bath for <span class="gemarra-regular">immersion, </span>and any places of <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">women make use are exempt from </span>the obligation of <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is inconsistent with the opinions of both Rav Kahana and Rav Yehuda. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana interprets </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">according to his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, and Rav Yehuda interprets </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">according to his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana interprets </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">according to his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning: Your house </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">your house that is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">designated </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">your </span>residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">to the exclusion of a storehouse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for hay, and a cattle barn, and a woodshed, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a storehouse, which are exempt from </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where their use is <span class="gemarra-regular">standard </span>and they are not used for bathing or other immodest acts. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">some obligate </span>these structures in the mitzva of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where their use is <span class="gemarra-regular">standard. In truth they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the following with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a bathroom, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a tannery, and a bathhouse, and a </span>ritual bath for <span class="gemarra-regular">immersion, </span>and any places of <span class="gemarra-regular">which women make use; and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the meaning of the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Make use? </span>It is that women <span class="gemarra-regular">bathe </span>there. These places <span class="gemarra-regular">are exempt from </span>the obligation of <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
The Gemara challenges this interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>that make use in this context means bathe, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>identical to the <span class="gemarra-regular">bathhouse. </span>Why would the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> need to list both a bathhouse and a place where women bathe? The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the bathhouse of the public, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it teaches us </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the bathhouse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of an individual</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As it could enter your mind</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to say: A bathhouse of the public, whose filth is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> extensive, </span>is exempt from <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, the bathhouse of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an individual, whose filth is not extensive, </span>as only women of that house bathe there, <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">obligated in</span> the mitzva of affixing a <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span>. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the bathhouse of an individual is also exempt. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda interprets </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">according to his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, and this </span>is what it <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: Your house </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">your house that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is designated </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">your </span>residence, <span class="gemarra-regular">to the exclusion of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> storehouse for hay, and a cattle barn, and a woodshed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and a storehouse, which are exempt from </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even </span>in a case where women <span class="gemarra-regular">adorn themselves there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And some obligate </span>these structures in the mitzva of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">women adorn themselves </span>there. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, in</span> a case where use of the building is <span class="gemarra-regular">standard, </span>everyone <span class="gemarra-regular">agrees </span>that these structures <span class="gemarra-regular">are exempt from </span>the mitzva of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">In truth they said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a bathroom, and a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tannery, and a bathhouse, and a </span>ritual bath for <span class="gemarra-regular">immersion</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, even though women adorn themselves </span>there, <span class="gemarra-regular">are exempt from </span>the obligation of <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, because its filth is extensive.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to Rav Yehuda, </span>in cases where use of the building is <span class="gemarra-regular">standard, </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agree </span>that a storehouse <span class="gemarra-regular">is exempt from </span>the mitzva of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that it is written with regard to the mitzva to affix a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon your gates, </span>meaning that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the gates</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of houses, and the gates of courtyards, and the gates</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of cities, and the gates of towns, and a barn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and chicken coops, and a hay storehouse, and wine storehouses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and oil storehouses, all </span>of them are <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>in the mitzva of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>? I <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought <span class="gemarra-regular">that I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">include </span>in the obligation of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even</span>

Daf 11b

<span class="gemarra-regular">a gatehouse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> used to guard the entrance to a courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">a portico [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">akhsadra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> an open porch, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a balcony </span>serving as a corridor to several residences. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: House; just as a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> house </span>is a place that <span class="gemarra-regular">is designated for residence </span>and is obligated in the mitzva of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>, so too all similar structures are obligated. This is to the <span class="gemarra-regular">exclusion of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> those </span>structures <span class="gemarra-regular">that are not designated for residence </span>but for other purposes, which are exempt from the mitzva of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>. 
I <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought <span class="gemarra-regular">that I include </span>in the obligation of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even a bathroom, and a tannery, and a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bathhouse, and a </span>ritual bath <span class="gemarra-regular">for immersion. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: House; just as a house </span>is a place <span class="gemarra-regular">that is designed to honor </span>people who enter it, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span><span class="gemarra-regular">too, all </span>places <span class="gemarra-regular">that are designed to honor </span>those who enter are obligated in the mitzva of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">excluding those </span>structures <span class="gemarra-regular">that are not designed to honor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
I <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I include </span>in the obligation of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Temple </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Moun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">chambers and courtyards. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">states: House; just as a house </span>is a place <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is non-sacred, so too any </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">that is non-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">sacred </span>is obligated in the mitzva of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">excluding those </span>places <span class="gemarra-regular">that are sacred. </span>For the purposes of this discussion, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that there are Sages who hold that barns and storehouses whose use is standard require a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>, contrary to the opinion of Rav Yehuda that everyone agrees that these structures are exempt. Consequently, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is a <span class="gemarra-regular">conclusive refutation </span>of his opinion and support for the contention of Rav Kahana that this matter is the subject of a tannaitic debate. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Yehuda taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rava: Six gates are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exempt from </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The gate of a <span class="gemarra-regular">storehouse for hay, </span>and of a <span class="gemarra-regular">cattle barn, and </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">woodshed, and a storehouse, and </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">Median gate, </span>which is a dome, lacking two doorposts and a lintel, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an unroofed gate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">a gate that is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high. </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You began </span>your statement <span class="gemarra-regular">with six </span>gates that do not require a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and you concluded with seven. </span>
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The obligation to affix a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> to a <span class="gemarra-regular">Median gate is</span> subject to a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to the gateway of <span class="gemarra-regular">a dome</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., an arched gateway, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> obligates </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exempt </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they agree that if, at the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">foot </span>of the entrance, <span class="gemarra-regular">there are </span>doorposts <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths high before the arch of the dome begins narrowing the width of the entrance, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated in </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span> since the sides form a usual doorway. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that if the entire opening is only <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high and at the foot </span>of its entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">there are </span>doorposts <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths high, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nothing. </span>It is not considered an entrance and is exempt from the mitzva of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">at the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> foot </span>of its entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">there are </span>doorposts <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths high, but the entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">is not ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">high, it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nothing, </span>as it is not considered a viable entrance.
<span class="gemarra-regular">They disagree only </span>with regard to a case where the entrance is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths high, <span class="gemarra-regular">and at the foot </span>of the entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">there are </span>doorposts <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>handbreadths high, <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span> at <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>point is <span class="gemarra-regular">the width </span>of the opening <span class="gemarra-regular">four</span> handbreadths. However, the space in the dome alongside the entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>wide <span class="gemarra-regular">enough to </span>theoretically <span class="gemarra-regular">carve out </span>space to <span class="gemarra-regular">complete</span> a width of <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>handbreadths. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir holds </span>that in all cases where a certain minimum area is required for a specific <span class="it-text">halakha</span> to take effect and the existing area is smaller, if circumstances would theoretically allow one to carve out and create an area of the requisite size, its legal status is as if <span class="gemarra-regular">one carves out </span>the space <span class="gemarra-regular">to complete </span>it. Therefore, the opening is considered wide enough to require a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis hold: One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not carve out </span>the space <span class="gemarra-regular">to complete </span>it. Since the width of the opening is not actually four handbreadths, it is exempt from the mitzva of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> synagogue, a woman’s house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">a house </span>jointly owned by <span class="gemarra-regular">partners </span>are all <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated in </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara asks: That is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious; </span>why would these structures be exempt? <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Your house,” </span>in the masculine, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not her</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “Your house,” </span>in the singular, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their house, </span>excluding a jointly owned house. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that those houses are obligated in the mitzva of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> like all others. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed so </span>that a woman’s house and a jointly owned house are exempt. The Gemara rejects this possibility: Immediately following the mitzva of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> is the reward for its fulfillment, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “So</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that your days be numerous, as well as the days</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of your sons” </span>(Deuteronomy 11:21). If these structures were exempt from the mitzva, the question would arise: Do <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>men and individuals <span class="gemarra-regular">require </span>long <span class="gemarra-regular">life</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and these, </span>meaning women and partners, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not require </span>long <span class="gemarra-regular">life? </span>The mitzva of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> clearly applies to all of them. 
The Gemara then asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, why do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>need the emphasis of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">Your house, </span>if every house is obligated in the mitzva of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>? The Gemara answers: This could be understood <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava, as Rava said: </span>Your house is interpreted to mean that the <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> is placed in <span class="gemarra-regular">the way </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that you ente</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> the house. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when a person lifts</span> his foot to begin walking, <span class="gemarra-regular">he lifts his right foot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first. </span>Therefore, the <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> is affixed on the right side of the doorway. 
§ Apropos the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> just cited, the Gemara cites a related <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that addresses a different topic. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">synagogue, a house </span>jointly owned by <span class="gemarra-regular">partners, and a woman’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s house become impure with </span>the impurity of <span class="gemarra-regular">leprosy </span>of the house, like all other houses. The Gemara asks: That is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious; </span>why wouldn’t they become impure? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that it is written with regard to leprosy: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the one whom the house is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his will come” </span>(Leviticus 14:35), which could be interpreted: <span class="gemarra-regular">His and not hers; his and not theirs, </span>to the exclusion of a house owned by a woman or by partners. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches us </span>that these houses are also included in this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">indeed so </span>that a woman’s house and a jointly owned house are excluded from the impurity of leprosy. The Gemara responds that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “In a house of the land of your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">possession” </span>(Leviticus 14:34). The word your is written in the plural form to teach that all houses in Eretz Yisrael are subject to this impurity. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, why do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I </span>need the emphasis of the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">His, </span>if every house is subject to the impurity of leprosy? The Gemara answers that the term does not teach a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> but reveals why a house might be afflicted with leprosy. The house belonging to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who dedicates his house to himself</span> alone, <span class="gemarra-regular">who refuses to lend his vessels </span>to others <span class="gemarra-regular">and says that he does not have </span>them, will be punished. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Holy One, Blessed be He, publicizes his </span>possessions for all to see <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>he is forced to <span class="gemarra-regular">empty</span> them from <span class="gemarra-regular">his house </span>due to leprosy. <span class="gemarra-regular">This excludes </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">who lends his vessels to others; </span>his house is not afflicted with leprosy. 
The Gemara raises another question: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> with regard to a <span class="gemarra-regular">synagogue, does it become impure with</span> the impurity of <span class="gemarra-regular">leprosy? But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought <span class="gemarra-regular">that synagogues and study</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> halls become impure with </span>the impurity of <span class="gemarra-regular">leprosy. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: And the one whom the house is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his will come; </span>this is referring to a house <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is designated for him, excluding those </span>houses <span class="gemarra-regular">that are not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">designated for him </span>but are public property.
The Gemara responds: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as it is the subject of a tannaitic dispute. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that a synagogue can become impure with the impurity of leprosy, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir; that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that a synagogue cannot become impure with the impurity of leprosy, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A synagogue</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in which there is a residence for the synagogue attendant</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is obligated in </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-italic">mezuza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as it is a dwelling. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a synagogue in which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is no residence, Rabbi Meir obligates </span>it in the mitzva of <span class="it-text">mezuza</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis exempt </span>it. Rabbi Meir deems a synagogue like a residence with regard to both a <span class="it-text">mezuza</span> and its susceptibility to leprosy. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>instead a different resolution to the contradiction between the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> with regard to the synagogue. Both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> are in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that it can become impure, is referring to a synagogue <span class="gemarra-regular">in which there is a place of residence; that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that it cannot become impure, is referring to a synagogue <span class="gemarra-regular">in which there is not a place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of residence. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, say </span>instead yet a different resolution to the contradiction between the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span>: Both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> are referring to synagogues <span class="gemarra-regular">in which there is not a place of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> residence, </span>

Daf 12a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that a synagogue does not become impure, is referring to synagogues <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>large <span class="gemarra-regular">cities. </span>Since those synagogues attract people from different places, the building is not the property of the local residents but that of the public. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which states that a synagogue becomes impure, is referring to synagogues <span class="gemarra-regular">in villages, </span>which belong solely to the residents of the village, and their status if like that of a house owned by partners. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And do</span> the synagogues <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>large <span class="gemarra-regular">cities not become ritually impure </span>with the impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">of leprosy? Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that it is written: “In a house of the land of <span class="gemarra-regular">your possession” </span>(Leviticus 14:34); the land of <span class="gemarra-regular">your possession becomes ritually impure </span>with the impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">of leprosy, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem does not become ritually impure </span>with the impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">of leprosy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since it belongs to all the Jewish people rather than to a specific tribe? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: I heard </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">only the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">site of the Temple [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mikdash</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] alone </span>that does not become ritually impure with the impurity of leprosy. It can be inferred <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>in the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, even <span class="gemarra-regular">synagogues</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and study halls </span>in Jerusalem <span class="gemarra-regular">become ritually impure </span>with the impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">of leprosy, and </span>that is the case <span class="gemarra-regular">even though</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they </span>are synagogues <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>large <span class="gemarra-regular">cities. </span>The Gemara rejects this; rather, one must emend the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda said: I heard </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">only a sacred</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mekudash</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] site alone. </span>That definition includes synagogues and study halls. 
§ The Gemara explains the dispute in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that was cited: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? The first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds: Jerusalem was not divided among </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the tribe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> but belonged to all of the Jewish people, and as such it does not become ritually impure with the impurity of leprosy. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda holds: Jerusalem was divided</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> between the tribes </span>of Judah and Benjamin. Therefore, the same <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of impurity apply there as apply in all other cities in Eretz Yisrael. 
The Gemara states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>that dispute corresponds <span class="gemarra-regular">to the dispute </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-italic">’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>part of the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>located <span class="gemarra-regular">in the portion of </span>the tribe of <span class="gemarra-regular">Judah? </span>It was the part including <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>entire <span class="gemarra-regular">Temple Mount, </span>excluding those areas in the portion of Benjamin, <span class="gemarra-regular">the chambers, and the courtyards. And what </span>part of the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">was in the portion of </span>the tribe of <span class="gemarra-regular">Benjamin? </span>It was the part including <span class="gemarra-regular">the Entrance Hall </span>of the Sanctuary, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Sanctuary, and the Holy of Holies</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And a strip </span>of land <span class="gemarra-regular">emerges </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">the portion of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Judah and enters the portion of Benjamin on which the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> altar is built</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And Benjamin the righteous would suffer</span> longing <span class="gemarra-regular">to engulf it every day. </span>The tribe of Benjamin was disappointed that the strip belonging to the tribe of Judah intersected its tribal land and wanted Judah to transfer ownership so that the land with the altar would belong to Benjamin. 
An allusion to this is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated </span>in Moses’ blessing to Benjamin: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Ever does he protect him </span>and he rests between his shoulders” (Deuteronomy 33:12), like one who is unable to abide something stuck between his shoulders and constantly rubs it to remove it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, Benjamin the righteous was privilege</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> serve as host [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ushpizekhan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the Almighty, as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is stated: “And he rests between his shoulders,” </span>alluding to the fact that the Holy of Holies was located in the territory of Benjamin. According to this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, Jerusalem was divided among the tribes. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem was not divided among the tribes </span>at all, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Homeowners did <span class="gemarra-regular">not let</span> their <span class="gemarra-regular">houses in Jerusalem because </span>the houses <span class="gemarra-regular">were not </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">theirs. </span>Residents of Jerusalem did not own their residences, as the city belonged to the entire Jewish people. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Tzadok says: Even beds </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>rented. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">hides of consecrated animals </span>of the Festival peace-offerings, which the pilgrims to Jerusalem would give as gifts to their hosts, the hosts were not really entitled to them. This is why <span class="gemarra-regular">the hosts </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">take them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by force. Abaye said: Learn from it that it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> customary for a guest to leave </span>his empty wine <span class="gemarra-regular">jug</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and hides </span>from sacrificial animals and give them <span class="gemarra-regular">to his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> host.</span>
After discussing the status of Jerusalem, the Gemara addresses the matter of synagogues in villages. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And do </span>the synagogues <span class="gemarra-regular">in villages become impure </span>with the impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">of leprosy? Wasn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as follows? It is written: “When you enter the land of Canaan that I give you <span class="gemarra-regular">for a possession, </span>and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession” (Leviticus 14:34). The term: “For a possession,” means <span class="gemarra-regular">until you conquer it </span>and it becomes entirely yours. However, in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">they conquered it but did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">divide it among the tribes, </span>or where <span class="gemarra-regular">they divided </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">among the tribes but did not distribute </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">patrilineal families; </span>or where <span class="gemarra-regular">they distributed </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the patrilineal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">families, but every one </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">does not recognize his </span>individual portion, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>is it derived that it does not become impure? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “And the one whom</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the house is his will come” </span>(Leviticus 14:35); one <span class="gemarra-regular">whom </span>the house <span class="gemarra-regular">is designated for him </span>and who is certain of his ownership, <span class="gemarra-regular">excluding those </span>houses <span class="gemarra-regular">which are not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> designated for him. </span>Apparently, the legal status of synagogues in villages is that of communal property, as the portion of each individual is not clearly identifiable, and therefore they cannot become impure. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>there is no distinction in this regard between synagogues in large cities and those in villages. And with regard to the original question, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is clear as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we responded initially </span>with alternative resolutions to the contradiction between the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span>. 
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And they would designate another priest </span>in the High Priest’s stead, lest a disqualification due to impurity prevent his entering the Temple on Yom Kippur. The Gemara asks: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualification befell</span> the incumbent High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">prior to the </span>sacrifice of the <span class="gemarra-regular">daily morning offering </span>on Yom Kippur, that <span class="gemarra-regular">one initiates </span>the replacement by dressing him in the eight garments of the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">with the daily morning offering, </span>which renders him acting High Priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualification befell </span>the incumbent High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">after the daily morning offering, how does one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">initiate </span>the replacement? After the daily morning offering, the High Priest begins the Yom Kippur service clothed in the four linen garments unique to the day, which are the same as the tunic, trousers, turban, and belt of the common priest. How is it evident that he is the acting High Priest? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava said: </span>It is evident <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>means of his <span class="gemarra-regular">belt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The belt worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur was made of linen, unlike that of the common priest, which was a mixture of the diverse kinds of linen and wool. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This</span> works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who said: </span>Throughout the rest of the year, <span class="gemarra-regular">the belt of the High</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Priest, </span>which the Torah clearly states is made of a mixture of diverse kinds, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>identical to <span class="gemarra-regular">the belt of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the common priest, </span>whereas on Yom Kippur, the belt is made of linen. When the replacement priest dons the linen belt he is initiated as the acting High Priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">However</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, according to the one who said: The belt of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> High Priest is not </span>identical to <span class="gemarra-regular">the belt of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> common priest, what can be said? </span>According to this approach, throughout the year the High Priest wears a belt of blue and purple wool and linen, while the belts of common priests are made of white linen like the rest of their clothes. Therefore, on Yom Kippur, when the High Priest dons a belt of white linen, his belt is identical to that of a common priest. If so, what initiates the replacement as acting High Priest?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>Before the replacement begins serving on Yom Kippur with the four linen garments, he is initiated and promoted to the High Priesthood by <span class="gemarra-regular">donning </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>garments of the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">and turning</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> over </span>one of the limbs on the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">with a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fork</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> thereby accelerating the burning of the daily morning offering. By performing part of the service while wearing the garments of the High Priest, he is initiated as acting High Priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Huna, as Rav Huna said: A non-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">priest who turns over </span>part of the offering on the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">with a for</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is liable </span>to receive the <span class="gemarra-regular">death</span> penalty because he engaged in Temple service restricted to priests. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Pappa said: </span>

Daf 12b

That action is unnecessary and therefore superfluous; <span class="gemarra-regular">his service</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> initiates him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The replacement High Priest need not undergo any preliminary initiation. His very performance of the Yom Kippur service, which is valid only if performed by the High Priest, initiates him as acting High Priest. As proof, the Gemara states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all the </span>sacred <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels that Moses made, their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> anointment </span>with oil <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrates them. From that </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">forward, </span>in the generations after Moses, new vessels did not require anointment to be consecrated; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>use in Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service </span><span class="gemarra-regular">initiates them </span>and renders them fit for use. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">too, </span>with regard to the High Priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">his service initiates </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him.</span>
§ Apropos the belt of the High Priest, the Gemara cites the aforementioned dispute in its entirety. <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Dimi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the belt of the common priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> there is a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Elazar, son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon. One said: </span>It was a mixture <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds </span>of wool and linen, like the belt of the High Priest mentioned in the Torah. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one said: </span>It was made of <span class="gemarra-regular">fine linen, </span>like the rest of the garments of the common priest.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude that it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">who said </span>that the belt of the common priest was a mixture <span class="gemarra-regular">of diverse kinds, as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The only </span>difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> High Priest and a common priest is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">belt; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi Shimon, says: Not even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">belt </span>represents a difference between them. The Gemara explains: With regard to the difference between the High Priest and the common priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">when</span> is there a dispute between the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that the dispute is with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the rest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the days of the year, there are many </span>other differences between them, since <span class="gemarra-regular">the High Priest serves </span>wearing <span class="gemarra-regular">eight garments and the common </span>priest wears <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>garments. Therefore, that could not be the point of the dispute.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>that the dispute is with regard to the differences between the High Priest and the common priest on <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> They agree that the belt of the High Priest on Yom Kippur is made of linen, but disagree with regard to the common priest’s belt. According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, who says that there is a difference between the belts, the belt of the common priest must be made of a mixture of diverse kinds. According to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, who says that there is no difference between their belts, the belt of the common priest must be made of linen, like that of the High Priest on Yom Kippur. 
The Gemara rejects this proof. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: No, </span>this is not a proof, as <span class="gemarra-regular">actually, </span>the dispute is with regard to the differences <span class="gemarra-regular">during the rest of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the days of the year. </span>However, the dispute is not with regard to all the differences between the High Priest and the common priest, but rather only with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>four garments <span class="gemarra-regular">common </span>to both priests: The tunic, trousers, turban, and belt. Based on this understanding that the dispute is with regard to the rest of the year, the analysis of the dispute is reversed: According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the belt of the High Priest is a mixture of diverse kinds and that of the common priest is made of linen, while according to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, the belt of the common priest is a mixture of diverse kinds. Therefore, there is no definitive proof from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">When Ravin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <span class="gemarra-regular">he stated </span>this tradition in a clearer fashion: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the belt of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the High Priest on Yom Kippur, everyone agrees </span>that it is made <span class="gemarra-regular">of fine linen, </span>as stated in the Torah. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the belt of the High Priest </span><span class="gemarra-regular">during the rest of the days of the year, everyone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">agrees </span>that it is a mixture <span class="gemarra-regular">of diverse kinds. They</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disagreed only with regard to the belt of the common</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> priest both during the rest of the days of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> year and on Yom Kippur, as Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi says: It was a mixture <span class="gemarra-regular">of diverse kinds, and Rabbi Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, son of Rabbi Shimon, says </span>it was made <span class="gemarra-regular">of linen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: We, too, have learned </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The Torah says with regard to the removal of the ashes from the altar: “And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen trousers shall he put <span class="gemarra-regular">upon his flesh” </span>(Leviticus 6:3). The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> questions the formulation of the verse. Since at the beginning of the verse it is written: “And the priest shall put on,” for <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">does the verse state: “Shall he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">put upon,” </span>in the latter part of the verse? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda says: </span>It comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>donning the <span class="gemarra-regular">mitre </span>and the <span class="gemarra-regular">belt for the removal of the ashes, </span>even though it is not explicitly stated in the verse. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa says </span>that the term: Shall put on, comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the garments of the High Pries</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Yom Kippur</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are fit for a common priest. </span>During the Yom Kippur service, the High Priest wears just four linen garments. Although he may not serve in those garments on Yom Kippur the following year, a common priest may serve in them during the rest of the year. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: There are two responses to </span>reject this <span class="gemarra-regular">statemen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> of Rabbi Dosa. <span class="gemarra-regular">One: The belt of the High Priest on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur is not </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">the belt of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the common priest </span>during the rest of the year. Clearly, according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the belt of the High Priest on Yom Kippur is made of linen, and that of the common priest during the year is a mixture of the diverse kinds of wool and linen. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>there is another reason to reject the statement of Rabbi Dosa. Could it be that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">garments that were used </span>by the High Priest to perform a service of <span class="gemarra-regular">extreme </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sanctity, </span>the common priest <span class="gemarra-regular">will use them </span>to perform a service of <span class="gemarra-regular">minor sanctity? Rather, </span>according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, for <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">does the verse state </span>the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall put on? </span>It comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to include threadbare </span>garments and to teach that as long as they are not completely tattered, they may be worn for that service. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Dosa follows his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: That which is written: “And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the Sanctuary, <span class="gemarra-regular">and shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> leave them there” </span>(Leviticus 16:23), <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that the garments worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">require intermen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and may not be put to additional use. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>It means only that the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> use them </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a different </span>year. According to Rabbi Dosa, they may be worn by a common priest during his service, as they do not require interment. 
§ The Gemara returns to the initiation of the acting High Priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sages taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a disqualification befalls </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">and they appointed another in his stead,</span> and then the cause of the disqualification of the High Priest is resolved, e.g., he was purified from impurity, the <span class="gemarra-regular">original </span>High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">returns to his service. </span>With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">second, </span>acting High Priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the mitzvot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the High Priesthood are </span>incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon him. </span>He serves wearing eight garments and it is prohibited for him to let his hair grow, to rend his garments in mourning the death of a relative, to subject himself to impurity imparted by the corpse of a relative, or to marry a widow. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosei says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">original </span>priest <span class="gemarra-regular">returns to his service, </span>while the <span class="gemarra-regular">second is fit </span>to serve <span class="gemarra-regular">neither as High Priest </span>with eight garments, because there is a different High Priest; <span class="gemarra-regular">nor as a common priest </span>with four garments, as once he was elevated to a state of extreme sanctity he may not be reduced to a state of minor sanctity. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said </span>as proof for his opinion: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving </span>the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">Yosef ben Ele</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Tzippori</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who, when a reason for <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualification befell a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> High Priest, </span>the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">appointed him in his stead. </span>After the cause of the disqualification was resolved, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">original </span>High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">returns to his service, </span>while the <span class="gemarra-regular">second is fit </span>to serve <span class="gemarra-regular">neither as High </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Priest nor as a common priest. </span>The Gemara explains: Neither as a <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest, due to hatred</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> jealousy and bitterness that would arise if there were two High Priests with equal standing in the Temple; nor as a <span class="gemarra-regular">common</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> priest, because </span>the principle is: <span class="gemarra-regular">One elevates </span>to a higher level <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>matters of <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctity and one does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">downgrade. </span>Once he has served as a High Priest he cannot be restored to the position of a common priest. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan said: </span>

Daf 13a

The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yose</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span> that the original High Priest returns to his service, while the second is fit to serve neither as High Priest nor as a common priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei concedes that if </span>the second priest <span class="gemarra-regular">violated </span>this provision <span class="gemarra-regular">and served </span>as High Priest wearing eight garments, <span class="gemarra-regular">his service is valid. Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, and Rabbi Yosei conceded that if </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">original </span>High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, </span>the second <span class="gemarra-regular">returns to his service </span>as High Priest. 
The Gemara asks: That is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious. </span>Clearly, the second priest may serve as High Priest after the first one dies without concern that their rivalry will generate hatred between them. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that the mere knowledge that another priest is in waiting to replace him is enough to generate hatred, and <span class="gemarra-regular">would be for him</span> like a woman whose husband has taken a <span class="gemarra-regular">rival wife</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">lifetime; </span>therefore, Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this is not a concern. 
§ It was taught in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>The Sages would <span class="gemarra-regular">even designate </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another wife for </span>the High Priest lest his wife die. The Rabbis say: There is no concern lest his wife die, and therefore the Sages did not designate another wife for him. The Gemara asks with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Aren’t they concerned lest </span>he become impure, which is why the Sages designate a replacement High Priest? Why then, are they not concerned lest his wife die? The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: Impurity </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is common, </span>as it is not unusual for the High Priest to become impure either due to secretions from his body or from an external source. <span class="gemarra-regular">Death is not common</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and therefore there is no concern lest his wife die. 
It was taught in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis said to </span>Rabbi Yehuda: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>that you are concerned lest his wife die, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no end to the matter. </span>You should also be concerned lest the second wife die, requiring designation of a third and even a fourth wife. The Gemara comments: The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">spoke well to Rabbi Yehuda, </span>making a good point. What can Rabbi Yehuda respond? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span> could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: For </span>the potential <span class="gemarra-regular">death of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>wife, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are concerned; for </span>the potential <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of two </span>wives, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are not concerned, </span>as the likelihood of that happening is negligible. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what would <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>respond to that contention? They would say: <span class="gemarra-regular">If there is </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">to be concerned </span>for a potential death, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even for </span>the potential <span class="gemarra-regular">death of two </span>wives, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are concerned. </span>
The Gemara suggests: If according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>there is no distinction between concern that one wife might die and concern that two wives might die, <span class="gemarra-regular">let them say </span>the same with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to their own </span>opinion. Just as they designate a replacement lest the High Priest become impure, they should designate a second replacement lest the first replacement also become impure. The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: The High Priest is vigilant </span>in avoiding impurity. No amount of vigilance can prevent death. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he is vigilant </span>in avoiding impurity, then <span class="gemarra-regular">why do </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">designate another priest </span>in his stead? The reason for the designation of the replacement is that <span class="gemarra-regular">once we establish </span>a replacement as a <span class="gemarra-regular">rival, all the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">more so </span>will the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">more vigilant </span>in avoiding impurity to maintain his position. 
§ The Gemara asks with regard to Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is designation </span>of a second wife <span class="gemarra-regular">sufficient for him? The Merciful One stated </span>in the Torah: “And he shall make atonement for himself and for <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">house” </span>(Leviticus 16:11). House means wife; <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span>designated woman <span class="gemarra-regular">is not his wife </span>as they are not yet married. What purpose does designation serve if his wife dies on Yom Kippur? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He betroths her </span>before Yom Kippur. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>that does not solve the problem. <span class="gemarra-regular">As long as he has not married her, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">she is not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">his house, </span>i.e., his wife. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda says <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>not only is a replacement wife designated, but <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">marries her. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>another problem arises. The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">has two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">houses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the Merciful One said: “And he shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">make atonement for himself and for his house” </span>(Leviticus 16:11). He atones for one house <span class="gemarra-regular">and not for two houses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda says <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>after marrying the second wife, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> then divorces her. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he divorces </span><span class="gemarra-regular">her, our difficulty is restored to its </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">place. </span>There is no point in designating a second wife, as if the first wife dies, the second woman is not married to him. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>he marries her and <span class="gemarra-regular">divorces her provisionally</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as he says to her: This is your bill</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of divorce on condition that you die </span>on Yom Kippur. If she dies on Yom Kippur, then she was divorced retroactively and he has only one wife; if she does not die but the original wife dies, her divorce does not take effect and the second wife is married to the High Priest. In either case, the High Priest has only one wife. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And perhaps neither </span>she nor the original wife <span class="gemarra-regular">will die, and </span>the High Priest then <span class="gemarra-regular">has two houses </span>on Yom Kippur. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">said to her, </span>the woman designated: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is your bill of divorce on condition that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you will not die </span>on Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>she does <span class="gemarra-regular">not die, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">she is divorced </span>and he remains married to the original wife; <span class="gemarra-regular">if she dies, isn’t that</span> original wife <span class="gemarra-regular">alive </span>and he remains married to her alone? The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And perhaps the </span>second one will <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> die and her bill of divorce will be</span> a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">bill of divorce, </span>meaning she is not his wife, but <span class="gemarra-regular">her counterpart </span>might die, <span class="gemarra-regular">leaving </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">without a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wife </span>at all on Yom Kippur. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> her: This is your bill of divorce on condition </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that one of you dies. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">is alive, </span>and if <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, isn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">alive? </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And perhaps neither one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of them </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">die, and he will </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">have two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">houses. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>the question arises: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is </span>a document <span class="gemarra-regular">of that sort </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">bill of divorce? </span>Does a condition of that sort take effect? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rava say: </span>If a man says to his wife: <span class="gemarra-regular">This</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is your bill of divorce on condition that you will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not drink wine </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">all the days of my life</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and your life, that is not severance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The bill of divorce in the Torah is called a bill of severance, meaning that for the document to be valid all connections between the husband and wife must be severed. If there is a provision in the document that maintains a permanent connection between the spouses, e.g., not to drink wine for all of her life, the document does not effect a valid divorce. 
However, if one said to his wife: This is your bill of divorce on condition that you will not drink wine during <span class="gemarra-regular">all the days</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the life of so-and-so; that is severance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Since the condition is not dependent on her and him but on the life of a third party, it is like any other condition in a divorce. Therefore, in the case of the High Priest, since the divorce takes effect only if neither of the women dies, that is a condition that maintains a relationship between the husband and wife for as long as she lives, which invalidates the divorce. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the second wife: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is your bill</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of divorce on condition that your counterpart, </span>the other wife, <span class="gemarra-regular">will not die. If her counterpart, </span>the first woman, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not die, </span>the second woman <span class="gemarra-regular">is divorced; and if </span>the first woman <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, isn’t </span>the second woman <span class="gemarra-regular">alive </span>and not divorced? The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And perhaps her counterpart</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will die in the middle of the </span>Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">service</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and it will become clear </span>

Daf 13b

<span class="gemarra-regular">retroactively that the bill of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> divorce of this </span>second woman <span class="gemarra-regular">is not a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">bill</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of divorce, </span>since the first wife died. In that case, it turns out retroactively that <span class="gemarra-regular">he performed </span>part of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> service with two houses, </span>married to two wives. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the second wife: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is your bill of divorce on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">condition that your counterpart dies. </span>The Gemara asks: In this case, too, <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps her counterpart </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">di</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the bill</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of divorce of this </span>second woman <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">bill</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of divorce, and </span>he will <span class="gemarra-regular">remain without a house </span>at all. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this is a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he divorces both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of them </span>provisionally, with a different stipulation to each woman. <span class="gemarra-regular">To one, he says: This is your bill of divorce</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on condition that your counterpart will not die. And to</span> the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one, he says: This is your bill of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> divorce on condition that you will not enter the synagogue</span> on Yom Kippur, cognizant of the fact that she can easily fulfill that condition and thereby effect her divorce. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And perhaps her counterpart </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">not die, </span>fulfilling the condition and effecting the divorce of one wife; <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> she will not enter the synagogue</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> fulfilling the condition and effecting the divorce of the other wife. In that case <span class="gemarra-regular">the bill of divorce of both </span>women <span class="gemarra-regular">is a</span> valid <span class="gemarra-regular">bill of divorce and he remains without a wife</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">to one </span>of the women, the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">This is your bill of divorce on condition that your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">counterpart does not die. And to </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of the women <span class="gemarra-regular">he says: This is your bill of divorce </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on condition that I will enter the synagogue. If this </span>wife <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, that </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">one is alive; and if that </span>other one <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">is alive. What is there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>in refuting this possibility? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps her counterpart will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">die in the middle of the service, </span>and it will turn out retroactively that <span class="gemarra-regular">he performed </span>part of <span class="gemarra-regular">the service </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with two houses, </span>married to two wives. <span class="gemarra-regular">If he sees</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that she seeks, </span>i.e., she is about <span class="gemarra-regular">to die</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he </span>will then <span class="gemarra-regular">preemptively enter the synagogue, rendering the bill</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of divorce of </span>the dying wife <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">bill of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> divorce retroactively. </span>He will then be married to only one woman. In that way, a second wife can be designated for the High Priest without him being married to two women on Yom Kippur. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Avira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, strongly objects to </span>that conclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>that from the term: His house, in the singular, one derives one wife and not two, then <span class="gemarra-regular">two widows of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a brother who died without a child [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yevamot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> come from one house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., they were married to the same man, should <span class="gemarra-regular">not be </span>obligated <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>marry his brother in <span class="gemarra-regular">levirate marriage. </span>In addressing levirate marriage, the Torah says: “So shall it be done to the man that does not build his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9). One may derive from this: One house, i.e., wife, and not two. The Gemara responds that when the Torah says: “Then <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yevama</span> shall go up to the gate” (Deuteronomy 25:7), “and <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yevama</span> will draw nigh to him” (Deuteronomy 25:9), twice, it comes to <span class="gemarra-regular">include </span>a situation where the deceased had two wives; in that case one of them is required to marry his brother in levirate marriage. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sherevya, strongly objects to this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>It was stated above that a woman betrothed to the High Priest is not considered his house, i.e., his wife. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">so, a betrothed </span>woman whose betrothed passed away should <span class="gemarra-regular">not be </span>obligated <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>marry his brother in <span class="gemarra-regular">levirate marriage, </span>since the term: House, appears in that context as well. In practice, that is not the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. The Gemara answers that the Torah says: “The wife of the dead shall not be married <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>to one not of his kin” (Deuteronomy 25:5). The superfluous term: Outside, comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to include the betrothed woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Although she is technically still outside the family, the brother of the deceased must either marry her in levirate marriage or perform <span class="it-text">ḥalitza</span>. 
§ Apropos the death of the wife of the High Priest, the Gemara cites an additional <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: A High Priest sacrifices</span> offerings when he is an <span class="gemarra-regular">acute mourner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> on the day of a relative’s death, but <span class="gemarra-regular">does not eat</span> from those offerings. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: The entire day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">The entire day? </span>Rava said: This phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span><span class="gemarra-regular">only to bring him from his house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Not only is it permitted for the High Priest to serve in the Temple when he is an acute mourner, but it is a mitzva to bring him from his house to serve in the Temple for the entire day to help ease his pain. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: Now, </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">remove </span>the High Priest from the Temple when he is an acute mourner, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If a common priest <span class="gemarra-regular">was standing and sacrificin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">on top of the altar and heard that </span>a relative <span class="gemarra-regular">of his died, he leaves his service </span>in the middle <span class="gemarra-regular">and exits </span>the Temple; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: He completes </span>the service and then leaves. Rabbi Yehuda rules stringently in the case of a priest who is an acute mourner sacrificing an offering. Even though the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a common priest, it is reasonable to say that the same is true with regard to a High Priest as well. Rabbi Yehuda says that a High Priest who becomes an acute mourner exits the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">and you say we bring </span>the High Priest who is an acute mourner <span class="gemarra-regular">from his house </span>to serve? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The initial interpretation must be rejected. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">The entire day? </span>

Daf 14a

Rabbi Yehuda means <span class="gemarra-regular">to say that </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">does not serve for the entire day </span>even though the Torah allows him to do so, due to a rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree lest </span>he forget that he is an acute mourner and <span class="gemarra-regular">eat </span>consecrated food forbidden to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Adda bar Ahava said to Rava: And did Rabbi Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">issue a decree lest he eat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But didn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learn </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>The Sages would <span class="gemarra-regular">even designate another wife for him lest his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wife die? And if his wife dies, </span>he nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">performs</span> the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service, and Rabbi Yehuda did not issue a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> decree lest he eat. </span>That contradicts the other statement by Rabbi Yehuda that a High Priest may not serve for the entire day that he is an acute mourner. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? There</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it is Yom Kippur, when everyone</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not eat, he too </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">not come to eat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>during the rest of the year, <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">everyone eats, he too </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">come to eat. </span>Therefore, a decree was issued.
The Gemara raises a question from a different perspective: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">like this, </span>would the halakhic status of <span class="gemarra-regular">acute mourning take effect on him, </span>considering that <span class="gemarra-regular">she is divorced? </span>According to Rabbi Yehuda, the High Priest must give his wife a provisional divorce in which case she is no longer his wife and if she dies he is no longer obligated to mourn her. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Although </span>the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">acute mourning does not take </span><span class="gemarra-regular">effect on him, is he not troubled </span>over the death of his wife? Therefore, according to Rabbi Yehuda, it is appropriate to prohibit his performance of the service on that day. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> During <span class="gemarra-regular">all seven days </span>of the High Priest’s sequestering before Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">he sprinkles the blood</span> of the daily burnt-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he burns the incense</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and he removes </span>the ashes of <span class="gemarra-regular">the lamps </span>of the candelabrum, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he sacrifices the head and the </span>hind <span class="gemarra-regular">le</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> of the daily offering. The High Priest performs these tasks in order to grow accustomed to the services that he will perform on Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">On all the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">other days </span>of the year, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to sacrifice </span>any of the offerings, <span class="gemarra-regular">he sacrifices them, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the High Priest sacrifices </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">portion </span>that he chooses <span class="gemarra-regular">firs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and takes </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">portion </span>that he chooses <span class="gemarra-regular">first.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>this mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span>This mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, as if </span>it were in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>it is difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>With regard to a <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually pure </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">upon whom a sprinkling </span>of purification water <span class="gemarra-regular">fell, it renders him impure? </span>This is based on the enigmatic principle with regard to the water of the red heifer: It purifies the ritually impure and renders impure the ritually pure. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">how </span>can the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">perform the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service? </span>The High Priest is sprinkled with purification water on each of the seven days of his sequestering due to the possibility that he was impure with impurity imparted by a corpse. However, it is possible that he is ritually pure. If he is ritually pure, the sprinkling will render him impure. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the pure person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will sprinkle it upon the impure person” </span>(Numbers 19:19); this emphasis that he sprinkles the water upon the impure person comes to teach that if he sprinkled <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure </span>person, that person becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">pure; but </span>if he sprinkled <span class="gemarra-regular">on the pure </span>person, that person becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: These matters are stated </span>to teach that it is considered sprinkling <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if it is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">on items susceptible</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to impurity, </span>whereas if the water was sprinkled on items not susceptible to impurity, it is not considered sprinkling. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the halakhic implication of that statement? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a mishna: With regard to one who mistakenly <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to sprinkle </span>purification water <span class="gemarra-regular">on an animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which does not become impure when alive, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>happened to <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkle </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">upon </span>an impure <span class="gemarra-regular">person, if </span>water remains <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the hyssop </span>that he used to sprinkle the water, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span> should <span class="gemarra-regular">repeat </span>the action and sprinkle the purification water on the person to purify him. Since the first sprinkling was onto a person, who can become impure, the water remaining on the hyssop may be reused, and it is not disqualified by improper use. However, with regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to sprinkle </span>purification water <span class="gemarra-regular">on a person but </span>happened to <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkle </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">upon an animal, </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>water remains <span class="gemarra-regular">on the hyssop, he </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">not repeat </span>the action. Since the first sprinkling was onto an animal, which cannot become impure, the water is disqualified by improper use, and may not be used in a second sprinkling. 
The Gemara analyzes the basis of the dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the reason for </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Akiva? </span>Instead of writing: And the pure person will sprinkle it upon the impure person, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the Merciful One write </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the pure person will sprinkle it upon him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and it would be clear that it is upon the aforementioned impure person. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is taught by the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">Upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the impure person? Learn from it </span>that if he sprinkled <span class="gemarra-regular">on the impure </span>person, that person becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">pure; but</span> if he sprinkled <span class="gemarra-regular">on the pure </span>person, that person becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">impure. And the Rabbis </span>say with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">It comes </span>to teach that it is only considered sprinkling if it is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">on items susceptible to impurity. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">However, here, </span>with regard to sprinkling purification water on a pure person, it is derived through an <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference that he remains ritually pure: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the water falls <span class="gemarra-regular">on the impure </span>person, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">pure; </span>if the water falls on <span class="gemarra-regular">the pure </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>clear that he remains pure? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Akiva </span>would respond to that <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">That is what </span>King <span class="gemarra-regular">Solomon said: “I said I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would become wise, but it eludes me” </span>(Ecclesiastes 7:23). According to tradition, even Solomon in his great wisdom could not understand the contradictory nature of the sprinkling of purification water that purifies an impure person and impurifies a pure person. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis </span>ascribe Solomon’s bewilderment to a different aspect of the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who sprinkles </span>the water <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one upon whom one sprinkles </span>the water are <span class="gemarra-regular">pure; but one who touches </span>the water unrelated to sprinkling is <span class="gemarra-regular">impure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sprinkles </span>the water actually <span class="gemarra-regular">pure? Isn’t it written: “He who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkles the purification waters will wash his clothes, </span>and he who touches the purification waters will be unclean until evening” (Numbers 19:21)? The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">He who sprinkles? </span>It means: <span class="gemarra-regular">He who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">touches</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But isn’t it written: He who sprinkles? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And isn’t it written </span>in the same verse: And <span class="gemarra-regular">he who touches? And furthermore, </span>in that verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkles requires washing </span>of his <span class="gemarra-regular">clothes, </span>indicating a more severe level of impurity, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">one who touches does not require </span><span class="gemarra-regular">washing </span>of his <span class="gemarra-regular">clothes. </span>Apparently, when it is written: He who sprinkles, it is not referring to one who touches.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the Rabbis assert: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">He who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sprinkles? </span>It refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who carries </span>the purification water. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Merciful One write: One who carries; what is the reason</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">he who sprinkles is written </span>if the reference is to carrying? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>use of the term sprinkling to depict carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that in order to become impure from carrying purification water, one <span class="gemarra-regular">must </span>carry the <span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>required for <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling requires</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span>minimum <span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>of water, as then the concept of a measure required for sprinkling has meaning. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling does not require a</span> minimum <span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>of water, <span class="gemarra-regular">what can be said? </span>There is no concept of a measure required for sprinkling. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling does not require a </span>minimum <span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>of water, <span class="gemarra-regular">that applies </span>only to the measure of purification water that must be sprinkled on <span class="gemarra-regular">the back of the </span>impure <span class="gemarra-regular">man;</span> any amount will suffice. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, in the vessel </span>into which one dips the hyssop in order to sprinkle the water, a certain <span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>of water <span class="gemarra-regular">is required, as we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">How much </span>water should <span class="gemarra-regular">be in </span>the vessel so that it <span class="gemarra-regular">will be equivalent </span>to the measure required for <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling? </span>It must be <span class="gemarra-regular">equivalent </span>to the measure required <span class="gemarra-regular">to dip </span>

Daf 14b

<span class="gemarra-regular">the tops of the stems </span>of the hyssop branch into the water <span class="gemarra-regular">and sprinkle it. </span>Apparently, even according to the one who said that there is no minimum measure of water in the vessel there is a minimum measure for sprinkling. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>who said that the purification water impurifies the pure, the difficulty can be resolved: The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">performs </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire day </span>on each of the seven days of sequestering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and toward the evening </span>the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkle </span>the purification water <span class="gemarra-regular">upon him. </span>Even if he was pure and the sprinkling rendered him impure, he <span class="gemarra-regular">immerses </span>immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">and observes </span>the requirement to wait <span class="gemarra-regular">until sunset, </span>at which point he is purified and prepared to serve the next day. 
§ The mishna teaches that on each of the seven days the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">burns the incense and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> removes </span>the ashes from <span class="gemarra-regular">the lamps</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Apparently, incense </span>is burned <span class="gemarra-regular">first, and then the lamps </span>are cleaned. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from a mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Tamid</span> that discusses the lottery in which the priests performing the various tasks that constitute the morning Temple service are selected. That mishna first mentions the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who was privileged </span>to be selected to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">removal of the ashes from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inner altar, </span>and then <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who was privileged </span>to be selected to remove the ashes from the lamps of <span class="gemarra-regular">the candelabrum, </span>and only then does it deal with <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one who is privileged </span>to be selected burn <span class="gemarra-regular">the incense</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>According to that mishna, removing ashes from the candelabrum precedes the burning of the incense. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: Who is </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span> in tractate <span class="gemarra-italic">Tamid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is Rabbi Shimon Ish HaMitzpa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who disagrees with the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna here. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t we learn the opposite, as we learned </span>in the mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Tamid</span>: The priest sprinkles the blood of the daily offering on the altar. <span class="gemarra-regular">He comes to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the northeast corner </span>of the altar and <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkles </span>once on the <span class="gemarra-regular">northeast </span>corner. From there he proceeds to the <span class="gemarra-regular">southwest </span><span class="gemarra-regular">corner </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkles </span>once on the <span class="gemarra-regular">southwest </span>corner. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>this mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ish HaMitzpa changes the </span>sprinkling of the blood of the <span class="gemarra-regular">daily offering </span>relative to the sprinkling of blood of all other burnt-offerings. He agrees with the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> with regard to the first sprinkling of the blood; the priest comes to the <span class="gemarra-regular">northeast </span>corner and <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkles </span>once on the <span class="gemarra-regular">northeast </span>corner. However, when he proceeds to the <span class="gemarra-regular">southwest </span>corner he does not sprinkle once as he would when offering a burnt-offering; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">he sprinkles </span>on the <span class="gemarra-regular">west </span>side of the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">and then sprinkles </span>on the <span class="gemarra-regular">south </span>side. Since the disputing opinion is that of Rabbi Shimon Ish HaMitzpa, apparently the unattributed opinions in the <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span> in tractate <span class="it-text">Tamid</span> are not the opinions of Rabbi Shimon Ish HaMitzpa. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>there must be a different resolution to the contradiction between the mishna here and the one in tractate <span class="it-text">Tamid</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the Yom Kippur service in <span class="gemarra-regular">tractate </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Yoma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? It is Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon Ish HaMitzpa, </span>and tractate <span class="it-text">Tamid</span> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis who disagree with him. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> contradiction </span>from one mishna in <span class="gemarra-regular">tractate </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Yoma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> against </span>another mishna in <span class="gemarra-regular">tractate </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Yoma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> second lotter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> conducted daily among the priests determined the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who slaughters </span>the daily morning offering; <span class="gemarra-regular">who sprinkles </span>its blood; <span class="gemarra-regular">who removes the ashes </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">the inner altar; and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who removes the ashes </span>and burnt wicks from <span class="gemarra-regular">the candelabrum; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and who takes the limbs </span>of the daily offering <span class="gemarra-regular">up </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the ramp </span>to be burned later. Following the second lottery the priests dispersed, and they later reconvened for <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">third lottery. </span>Before the third lottery, the appointee declared: Let only those priests who are <span class="gemarra-regular">new to </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">the incense</span> come and <span class="gemarra-regular">participate in the lottery </span>for the incense. Apparently, removing the ashes from the lamps of the candelabrum preceded the burning of the incense, which contradicts the mishna here. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Here, </span>the mishna is discussing <span class="gemarra-regular">the removal </span>of the ashes from <span class="gemarra-regular">two lamps</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is performed after the burning of the incense; <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the mishna of the lotteries is discussing <span class="gemarra-regular">the removal </span>of the ashes from <span class="gemarra-regular">five lamps</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which precedes the burning of the incense. As will be explained, the priest attends to five lamps first, and after a break, he attends to the final two lamps. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>burning of the <span class="gemarra-regular">incense interposes </span>between attending to the first five lamps and attending the last two? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye related the order of the </span>daily <span class="gemarra-regular">priestly functions in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the name of tradition, didn’t </span>he state that it was the sprinkling of <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood of the daily offering </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that interposed between </span>the five lamps and the two, not the burning of the incense? The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. That </span>sequence cited by Abaye is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Shaul, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>sequence cited in the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">not remove </span>the ashes from <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lamps and then burn </span>the incense; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather one should burn </span>the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">and then remove </span>the ashes from the lamps. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Shaul says: One removes </span>the ashes from the lamps <span class="gemarra-regular">and then burns </span>the incense. The different sources reflect the dispute cited in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the rationale </span>for the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Shaul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “Every morning when he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> removes the ashes from the lamps, </span>he shall burn it” (Exodus 30:7), <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> then </span>it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He shall burn it” </span>(Exodus 30:8). First the lamps are cleaned, and only then is the incense burned. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how do <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who hold that the incense was burned first, interpret this verse? They say: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the Merciful One saying?</span>

Daf 15a

It means: <span class="gemarra-regular">At the time of </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> removal </span>of the ashes<span class="gemarra-regular"> you</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">shall burn the incense, </span>and no later. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if you do not say so </span>but explain that the phrase: He shall burn the incense, at the end of the verse means after cleaning the lamps, then with regard to the burning of the <span class="gemarra-regular">afternoon </span>incense, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">which</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And when Aaron lights the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lamps in the afternoon he shall burn it” </span>(Exodus 30:8), in<span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>case<span class="gemarra-regular"> too, </span>does it mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">initially </span>the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">lights the lamps and </span>only<span class="gemarra-regular"> then burns the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">afternoon incense? And if you say indeed, </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">so,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">wasn’t </span>the following<span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the verse: “Aaron and his sons will set it in order to burn <span class="gemarra-regular">from evening until morning</span> before the Lord; it shall be a statute forever throughout their generations on behalf of the children of Israel” (Exodus 27:21)? 
And the <span class="it-text">baraita </span>explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give </span>the candelabrum <span class="gemarra-regular">its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> measure </span>of oil so that <span class="gemarra-regular">it will continue to burn</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all night from evening until morning. Alternatively,</span> the phrase:<span class="gemarra-regular"> From evening to morning, </span>teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">you have only this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> service that is valid </span>when performed<span class="gemarra-regular"> from evening to morning</span>. Apparently, lighting the candelabrum is the final daily Temple service and the incense is not burned after the lamps are lit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what is the Merciful One saying </span>in the phrase: “And when Aaron lights the lamps in the afternoon he shall burn it.” This teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">at the time of </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> removal </span>of the ashes<span class="gemarra-regular"> you</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">shall burn the incense, </span>and no later. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">here too, </span>in the morning, <span class="gemarra-regular">at the time of</span> the<span class="gemarra-regular"> removal </span>of the ashes<span class="gemarra-regular"> you</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">shall burn the incense</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and no later. This is the rationale for the opinion of the Rabbis. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Abba Shaul</span> could have<span class="gemarra-regular"> said to you </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is different</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there, </span>with regard to the burning of the afternoon incense, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: </span>“Aaron and his sons will set <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span> [<span class="gemarra-italic">oto</span>] in order.” The term <span class="it-text">oto</span> is exclusionary: Only in the afternoon is it critical that the lighting of the lamps be the last service performed and that it follow the burning of the incense. However, in the morning, where there is no exclusionary term, the sequence of the verse is observed: First attending to the candelabrum and then burning the incense. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said </span>a different resolution to the contradiction between the <span class="it-text">mishnayot.</span> This is<span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>because each mishna is in accordance with the opinion of a different <span class="it-text">tanna</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>mishna, in which the burning of the incense is first, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis;</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>mishna, in which the lighting of the lamps is first, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Shaul.</span> The Gemara questions Rav Pappa’s resolution: In accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">which</span> <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is the mishna here established? </span>It is<span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis.</span> The sequence in the mishna where the <span class="gemarra-regular">lottery </span>is discussed is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Shaul. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Say the latter clause</span> of that mishna as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">They brought him the </span>sheep for <span class="gemarra-regular">the daily </span>morning <span class="gemarra-regular">offering that he slaughtered </span>by cutting most of the way through the gullet and the windpipe. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">different </span>priest<span class="gemarra-regular"> completed </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> slaughter on his behalf</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> And then <span class="gemarra-regular">he entered </span>the Sanctuary <span class="gemarra-regular">to burn the </span>morning<span class="gemarra-regular"> incense and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to remove </span>the ashes from<span class="gemarra-regular"> the lamps </span>of the candelabrum. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">we have </span>again <span class="gemarra-regular">arrived</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis</span> that burning the incense precedes attending to the lamps, which leads to the difficult conclusion: The <span class="gemarra-regular">first clause </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> last clause </span>of the mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Yoma</span> are in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis,</span> and the <span class="gemarra-regular">middle clause </span>is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Shaul. Rav Pappa </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: Indeed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">first clause and </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> last clause </span>are in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis,</span> and the <span class="gemarra-regular">middle</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clause </span>is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Shaul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Although this is not common, because these <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span> are not directly juxtaposed, it is possible.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye does not say in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa,</span> as he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>willing to<span class="gemarra-regular"> establish</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">first clause and </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> last clause </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis</span> and the <span class="gemarra-regular">middle clause </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Shaul.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to<span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Pappa, what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not say </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abay</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and instead prefers an uncommon and difficult resolution? Rav Pappa could have<span class="gemarra-regular"> said to you </span>that the resolution proposed by Abaye is difficult as well, as according to Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first clause </span>of the mishna it was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">removal </span>of the ashes from<span class="gemarra-regular"> two lamps, </span>which is performed later, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>only<span class="gemarra-regular"> then</span> taught the <span class="gemarra-regular">removal </span>of the ashes from<span class="gemarra-regular"> five lamps, </span>which is performed before the ashes of the two lamps are cleared. Therefore, Rav Pappa prefers to establish that the <span class="it-text">mishnayot </span>reflect a tannaitic dispute rather than to accept this reversal of the order. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Abaye </span>holds that this is not difficult and could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you</span> that the first mishna, which describes the routine of the High Priest during his seven days of separation, teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">a general directive </span>describing the services with which the High Priest must be familiarized prior to Yom Kippur, without concern for the sequence. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in terms of <span class="gemarra-regular">the sequence,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">then teaches </span>it in the context of the actual performance of the services. 
§ The Gemara cites a dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Shimon Ish HaMitzpa. The Gemara proceeds to analyze <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matter itself: </span>The priest <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to the northeast corner </span>of the altar and <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkles </span>once on the <span class="gemarra-regular">northeast</span> corner. From there he proceeds to the <span class="gemarra-regular">southwest corner </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkles</span> once on the <span class="gemarra-regular">southwest </span>corner.<span class="gemarra-regular"> And it was taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta </span><span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span>this mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon Ish HaMitzpa changes the</span> sprinkling of the blood of the<span class="gemarra-regular"> daily offering </span>vis-à-vis the sprinkling of blood of all other burnt-offerings. The priest comes to the <span class="gemarra-regular">northeast </span>corner and <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkles </span>once on the <span class="gemarra-regular">northeast</span> corner. However, when he proceeds to the <span class="gemarra-regular">southwest </span>corner, <span class="gemarra-regular">he sprinkles </span>on the <span class="gemarra-regular">west </span>side of the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">and then sprinkles </span>on the <span class="gemarra-regular">south </span>side. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the rationale </span>for the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon Ish HaMitzpa, </span>who changes the sprinkling of the blood of the daily offering vis-à-vis the sprinkling of blood of all other burnt-offerings? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the name of one </span>of the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> school of Rabbi Yannai </span>that<span class="gemarra-regular"> the verse states: “And one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> goat as a sin-offering to the Lord; it shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be offered aside from the daily burnt-offerin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its libation” </span>(Numbers 28:15). From the phrase: Beside the daily burnt-offering, it is derived that the daily offering is <span class="gemarra-regular">a burnt-offering</span>, and from the juxtaposition of the sacrifice of the sin-offering to the daily offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> One said: Perform with it the procedure of a sin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
And <span class="gemarra-regular">how </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>be accomplished? It can be accomplished by performing half of the sprinklings according to the procedure of a burnt-offering, and half according to the procedure of a sin-offering. One <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkles one</span> sprinkling<span class="gemarra-regular"> that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two,</span> i.e., one sprinkles the blood on the corner of the altar so that the blood is divided between the two sides, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the procedure of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> standard <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offering. </span>Then <span class="gemarra-regular">he sprinkles two </span>sprinklings <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are two, in accordance with the procedure of a sin-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The blood of a sin-offering is sprinkled in four separate actions, one on each of the four corners of the altar. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if the objective is to have the daily offering sacrificed like a sin-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him sprinkle </span>the blood in a manner that will accomplish both: First, <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>sprinklings<span class="gemarra-regular"> that are four </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the procedure of a</span> standard <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offering, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then<span class="gemarra-regular"> four </span>sprinklings<span class="gemarra-regular"> that are four in accordance with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the procedure of a sin-offering. </span>
The Gemara rejects that proposal: <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not find </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">blood that atones and </span>then<span class="gemarra-regular"> again atones.</span> Once the blood was sprinkled and brought atonement by following the procedure of the burnt-offering, one cannot then begin the rite of atonement of a sin-offering. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And did we find </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">blood</span> of an offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">half of which </span>is sprinkled as <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sin-offering and half of which</span> is sprinkled as <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> burnt-offering? Rather, perforce, </span>say that<span class="gemarra-regular"> the verse juxtaposes them</span> and commands that the blood of the daily offering be offered half as a burnt-offering and half as a sin-offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, perforce, </span>say that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse juxtaposes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>and commands two separate sprinklings: The sprinkling of a burnt-offering followed by the sprinkling of a sin-offering.
The Gemara responds: The two suggestions are different. <span class="gemarra-regular">There,</span> in the statement of Rabbi Shimon Ish HaMitzpa, there is no radical divergence from the standard burnt-offering; <span class="gemarra-regular">it is merely dividing the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sprinklings. </span>Instead of sprinkling the blood on the corner so that it falls on two sides of the altar, one sprinkles the blood on each of the two sides separately. In contrast, performing two independent acts of sprinkling is a radical divergence. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara suggests an alternative manner in which the daily offering could be offered like a sin-offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us sprinkle one </span>sprinkling<span class="gemarra-regular"> that is two below</span> the red line painted halfway up the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with the procedure of a</span> standard <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offering,</span> and sprinkle another <span class="gemarra-regular">two sprinklings that are two above </span>the red line on the upper half of the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with the procedure of a sin-offering</span>. 
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not find </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">blood half of which </span>is sprinkled <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>the red line <span class="gemarra-regular">and half of which</span> is sprinkled <span class="gemarra-regular">below </span>the red line. One either sprinkles all the blood on the lower half of the altar, as in the case of most offerings, or entirely on the upper half of the altar, as in the case of sin-offerings. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is there really <span class="gemarra-regular">no</span> case of that sort? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna: The High Priest took the blood of the bull into the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">and sprinkled from </span>the blood<span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>time<span class="gemarra-regular"> upward</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">seven</span> times <span class="gemarra-regular">downward? </span>Apparently, the blood of an offering can be sprinkled part upward, toward the upper part of the thickness of the Ark cover, and part downward, toward the lower part of the thickness of the Ark cover. 
The Gemara rejects this: That is not a case of half the blood sprinkled upward and half sprinkled downward. Instead, that sprinkling was <span class="gemarra-regular">like a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">matzlif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> the sprinklings were not performed one above the other, but rather one beneath the other, and all were sprinkled in a row on the Ark cover. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">like a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">matzlif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> demonstrated </span>with his hand; it means <span class="gemarra-regular">like one who whips</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>One who whips another does not strike in one place but directs one lash beneath another. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is there really <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>case of that sort? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna with regard to the sprinkling of blood on the incense altar: <span class="gemarra-regular">He sprinkled seven times from </span>the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tohoro</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the altar. What, is it not</span> referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">middle</span> of the side <span class="gemarra-regular">of the altar,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as people say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Clear noon [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tihara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the middle of the day?</span> In other words, <span class="it-text">tohoro</span> refers to halfway up the altar. Now, since the blood was sprinkled on the altar seven times, inevitably some of the blood landed above the midpoint and some of it landed below the midpoint. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Sheila said: No</span>, that is not the meaning of <span class="it-text">tohoro</span>. 

Daf 15b

Rather, <span class="it-text">tohoro</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>top of<span class="gemarra-regular"> the altar itself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is written: “Like the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> very sky for purity [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">latohar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Exodus 24:10). <span class="it-text">Tohoro </span>refers to the top of the altar after the ashes of the incense are cleared and the pure gold is visible. 
The Gemara returns to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon IshHaMitzpa: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is different that</span> he says to <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkle </span>in accordance with the procedure of the <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offering first and then sprinkle </span>in accordance with the procedure <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is used for the <span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offering? Let us first sprinkle</span> in accordance with the procedure <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is used for the <span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offering and then </span><span class="gemarra-regular">let us sprinkle </span>in accordance with the procedure <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is used for the<span class="gemarra-regular"> burnt-offering.</span> The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the daily offering <span class="gemarra-regular">is a burnt-offering, </span>that procedure <span class="gemarra-regular">takes precedence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and it is followed by the sin-offering. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different that</span> he says to <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkle </span>first on the <span class="gemarra-regular">northeast </span>corner of the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then on the <span class="gemarra-regular">southwest </span>corner? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkle </span>first on the <span class="gemarra-regular">southeast </span>corner <span class="gemarra-regular">and then</span> on the <span class="gemarra-regular">northwest </span>corner. The Sages<span class="gemarra-regular"> say:</span> That is because the blood of the <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offering requires </span>sprinkling on the side of the altar with <span class="gemarra-regular">a base</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is stated: “On the base of the altar of burnt-offering” (Leviticus 4:18) <span class="gemarra-regular">and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> southeast corner did not have a base</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, the sprinkling was performed on the northeast corner, where part of the base of the altar was located. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different that</span> he says to <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkle </span>first on the <span class="gemarra-regular">northeast </span>corner of the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then on the <span class="gemarra-regular">southwest </span>corner? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkle </span>first on the <span class="gemarra-regular">southwest </span>corner <span class="gemarra-regular">and then</span> on the <span class="gemarra-regular">northeast </span>corner. The Gemara answers that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">since</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Master said: All turns that you turn should be only</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the right</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> With regard to certain offerings sacrificed when the priest is on the south side of the altar, he would turn<span class="gemarra-regular"> to the east, </span>which was to his right. Since the animal to be offered is slaughtered to the north of the altar, he <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>sprinkles blood at the corner that <span class="gemarra-regular">he encounters</span> first.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>is the conclusion drawn that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> One says with regard to a burnt-offering to perform</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span> in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">procedure of</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps it is with regard to a sin-offering </span>of the New Moon<span class="gemarra-regular"> that the Merciful One says to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perform</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">procedure of</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">a burnt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara responds: This can<span class="gemarra-regular"> not enter your mind,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “It shall be offered aside from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the daily burnt-offering and its libation” </span>(Numbers 28:15). <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the Merciful One saying?</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Cast a matter of</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offering upon the</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offering, </span>i.e., apply the procedure of the sin-offering to the sacrifice of the burnt-offering.
§ Just as the contradiction above was resolved by attributing different sources to different <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span>, the Gemara cites an additional contradiction with a similar resolution. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna<span class="gemarra-regular"> there:</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">The appointee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the deputy High Priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the other priests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out and bring a lamb from the Chamber of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lambs, </span>where lambs awaiting sacrifice were kept after they underwent inspection and were found to be without blemish. That mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Chamber of the Lambs was </span>located <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> northwest corner </span>of the Hall of the Hearth in the Temple courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">And there were four chambers there </span>in that hall. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber of the Lambs, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber of the Seals</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In the Temple, seals were dispensed as receipts to individuals who paid for sacrificial animals. The person then showed the seal to a Temple official, who supplied him with an animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber of the Hall of the Hearth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one </span>was<span class="gemarra-regular"> the chamber where the shewbread was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prepared. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara<span class="gemarra-regular"> raises a contradiction</span> from a mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Middot</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Four chambers were</span> open <span class="gemarra-regular">into the Hall of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Hearth</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">like small </span>semi-open<span class="gemarra-regular"> rooms [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kitoniyyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that open </span><span class="gemarra-regular">into a </span>central <span class="gemarra-regular">hall [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">teraklin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Two </span>of these chambers were located in the <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred </span>area, in the Temple courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and two </span>of the chambers <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>located <span class="gemarra-regular">in the non-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">sacred</span> area of the Temple Mount. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the tops of</span> wooden <span class="gemarra-regular">stakes [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pispasin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> in the Hall of the Hearth <span class="gemarra-regular">divided between the sacred </span>area and the <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred </span>area to apprise the people in both areas where they were located and what conduct is required. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>purpose did these chambers <span class="gemarra-regular">serve? </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">southwest </span>chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">was the Chamber of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Sacrificial Lambs;</span> 

Daf 16a

the <span class="gemarra-regular">southeast </span>chamber in the Hall of the Hearth <span class="gemarra-regular">was the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> chamber in which the shewbread was prepared.</span> The <span class="gemarra-regular">northeast </span>chamber was the chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">in which the Hasmoneans sequestered the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">altar stones that were desecrated by the gentile kings </span>when they sacrificed idolatrous offerings. The <span class="gemarra-regular">northwest </span>chamber was the chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">in which </span>the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">descended </span>through tunnels <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Hall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Immersion.</span> There is a contradiction between the sources with regard to the location of the Chamber of the Lambs. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught</span> the <span class="it-text">mishnayot </span>in tractate <span class="gemarra-italic">Middot</span>? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’akov, </span>who has a different opinion with regard to this matter. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Middot</span>: The dimensions of the<span class="gemarra-regular"> women’s courtyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were a length of 135 </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">by a width of 135 </span>cubits,<span class="gemarra-regular"> and there were four</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> chambers in its four corners</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And what </span>purpose did these chambers <span class="gemarra-regular">serve? </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">southeast </span>chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">was the Chamber of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Nazirites</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as there the nazirites cook their peace</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offerings and shave their hair and cast </span>it in the fire to burn <span class="gemarra-regular">beneath the pot </span>in which the peace-offering was cooked, as the Torah instructs (see Numbers 6:18). The <span class="gemarra-regular">northeast </span>chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">was the Chamber</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Woodshed, where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blemished priests, </span>who are disqualified for any other service, <span class="gemarra-regular">stand</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and examine the logs </span>to determine if they were infested <span class="gemarra-regular">by worms, as any log in which there are worm</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is disqualified for </span>use <span class="gemarra-regular">on the altar.</span>
The <span class="gemarra-regular">northwest </span>chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">was the Chamber of the Lepers, </span>where lepers would immerse for purification. With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">southwest </span>chamber, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov said: I forgot </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>purpose it <span class="gemarra-regular">would serve. Abba Shaul says: They would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place wine and oil there </span>for the meal-offerings and libations, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it was called the Chamber of the House </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Oils. </span>From this mishna it may be inferred that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who taught the <span class="it-text">mishnayot </span>in tractate <span class="it-text">Middot</span> is Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, as that is why the mishna finds it necessary to mention that he forgot the purpose of one of the chambers. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">So too, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is reasonable</span> to conclude that the <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span> in tractate <span class="it-text">Middot</span> are in accordance with the opinion of<span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Eliezer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Ya’akov, as we learned </span>in a mishna there: <span class="gemarra-regular">All the walls that were there </span>surrounding the Temple Mount <span class="gemarra-regular">were high except for the Eastern Wall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">priest who burns the </span>red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer stands on the Mount </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Olives, </span>where the red heifer was slaughtered and burned, <span class="gemarra-regular">and directs </span>his attention <span class="gemarra-regular">and looks toward the entrance of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Sanctuar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when </span>he<span class="gemarra-regular"> sprinkles the blood. </span>
The Gemara seeks the opinion according to which this would be feasible. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">All the entrances that were there </span>in the Temple were <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty cubits high and ten cubits wide. And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a different mishna describing the layout of the Temple: <span class="gemarra-regular">Inside </span>the eastern wall of the Temple Mount was <span class="gemarra-regular">a latticed gate.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And we learned </span>in a different mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Inside </span>the latticed gate was <span class="gemarra-regular">the rampart, </span>which was an elevated area <span class="gemarra-regular">ten cubits </span>wide. In that area <span class="gemarra-regular">there were twelve stairs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">stair</span> was <span class="gemarra-regular">half a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubit high and half a cubit deep, </span>for a total ascent of six cubits. 
In addition, <span class="gemarra-regular">fifteen</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stairs ascend from within </span>the women’s courtyard and <span class="gemarra-regular">descend</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the Israelite courtyard to the women’s courtyard. </span>Each <span class="gemarra-regular">stair</span> was <span class="gemarra-regular">half a cubit high and half a cubit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> deep, </span>for an additional ascent of seven and a half cubits. The total height of both staircases together was thirteen and a half cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we learned </span>in that mishna: The area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the Entrance Hall and the altar </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-two cubits </span>wide,<span class="gemarra-regular"> and there were twelve stairs </span>in that area. Each <span class="gemarra-regular">stair</span> was <span class="gemarra-regular">half a cubit high </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and half a cubit deep, </span>for an additional ascent of six cubits and a total height of nineteen and a half cubits. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we learned </span>in that mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ya’akov says: There was</span> an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">stair there </span>between the Israelite courtyard and the priests’ courtyard. That stair was <span class="gemarra-regular">one cubit high, and the platform </span>on which the Levites stood on <span class="gemarra-regular">was placed upon i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and on it</span> were <span class="gemarra-regular">three stairs, each </span>with a height and depth of <span class="gemarra-regular">half a cubit,</span> for a total of twenty-two cubits.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that the <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span> in tractate <span class="it-text">Middot</span> are in accordance with the opinion of<span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Eliezer ben Ya’akov, that is</span> how it can be understood that <span class="gemarra-regular">the entrance was concealed. </span>The threshold of the entrance to the Sanctuary was more than twenty cubits higher than the threshold of the eastern gate of the Temple Mount. One looking through the Eastern Gate would be unable to see the entrance of the Sanctuary, because the gate was only twenty cubits high. In order to provide the priest performing the red heifer ritual on the Mount of Olives with a view of the entrance to the Sanctuary, the eastern wall had to be lowered. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, if you say </span>that the <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span> in tractate <span class="it-text">Middot</span> are in accordance with the opinion of<span class="gemarra-regular"> the Rabbis, </span>who do not add the two and a half cubits of the stair and the platform added by Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t there</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">half a cubit through which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the entrance can be seen? </span>Since the threshold of the Sanctuary is only nineteen and a half cubits higher than the threshold of the gate, the priest on the Mount of Olives could look through the eastern gate of the Temple Mount and see the bottom of the Temple entrance. There would be no need to lower the eastern wall. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>must one<span class="gemarra-regular"> not conclude from it </span>that that the <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span> in tractate <span class="it-text">Middot</span> are taught by<span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">akov?</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava said: </span>This is not a definitive proof, and it is still possible to interpret <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of this tractate in a different manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, whose is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>opinion that the Eastern Wall was lowered? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it was taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: The altar is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> centered and stands in the middle of </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>directly aligned with the entrances of the courtyards and the Sanctuary, and <span class="gemarra-regular">it was thirty-two cubits </span>long and thirty-two cubits wide. 

Daf 16b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Ten </span>of those <span class="gemarra-regular">cubits </span>stood<span class="gemarra-regular"> opposite the entrance to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Sanctuary.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Eleven </span>of those <span class="gemarra-regular">cubits </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">to the north</span> of the entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">and eleven</span> of those<span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the south </span>of the entrance. <span class="gemarra-regular">It follows </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">altar</span> was <span class="gemarra-regular">aligned </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Sanctuary and its walls. </span>According to this opinion, since the altar was directly aligned with the entrance of the Sanctuary, it blocked the entrance. The floor of Israelite courtyard was thirteen and a half cubits above the threshold of the Eastern Gate. Add nine cubits, which was the height of the altar, and the result is that the top of the altar was twenty-two and a half cubits higher than the threshold of the gate, rendering it impossible to see the entrance of the Sanctuary through the eastern gate of the Temple Mount. Therefore, it was necessary to lower the eastern wall to enable the priest standing on the Mount of Olives to see the entrance of the Sanctuary. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>to say that the <span class="it-text">mishnayot </span>in tractate <span class="gemarra-italic">Middot </span>are in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">do you find </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">altar </span>stood <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">middle of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in tractate <span class="it-text">Middot</span>?<span class="gemarra-regular"> But didn’t we learn</span> in a mishna there: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>dimensions<span class="gemarra-regular"> of the entire courtyard were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a lengt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of 187 </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">by a width of 135</span> cubits. That mishna elaborates: The length of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> east to west </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">187 </span>cubits, divided as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">The area of access </span>for the<span class="gemarra-regular"> Israelites, </span>known as the Israelite courtyard, was <span class="gemarra-regular">eleven cubits </span>long. <span class="gemarra-regular">The area of access </span>for<span class="gemarra-regular"> the priests to walk </span>and serve was <span class="gemarra-regular">eleven cubits </span>long, and the <span class="gemarra-regular">altar</span> itself was <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty-two </span>cubits long. There were <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-two </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">between the Entrance Hall and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the altar, and the Sanctuary </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred cubits </span>long. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there was an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">eleven cubits </span>of space <span class="gemarra-regular">behind </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Hall of the Ark Cover, </span>the Holy of Holies, which was at the western end of the Sanctuary. 
The Gemara provides the dimensions of the Temple’s width <span class="gemarra-regular">from south to north, </span>a total of <span class="gemarra-regular">135 </span>cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">The ramp and the alta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> together were <span class="gemarra-regular">sixty-two </span>cubits. The ramp and altar were each thirty-two cubits long, but two cubits of the upper part of the altar were subsumed in the base and ledge surrounding the altar. There were <span class="gemarra-regular">eight cubits from the altar to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rings </span>to the north of the altar, through which the heads of the sacrificial animals were placed for slaughter. <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">area of the rings </span>itself was <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-four </span>cubits, and <span class="gemarra-regular">from the rings to the tables </span>on which the animals were rinsed there were an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">From the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">table</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the pillars </span>on which the animals were suspended for flaying there were an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">From the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pillars to</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the courtyard wall</span> there were <span class="gemarra-regular">eight cubits. </span>The total to this point is 110 cubits. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the balance</span> of twenty-five cubits was <span class="gemarra-regular">between the ramp and the</span> southern <span class="gemarra-regular">wall,</span> along with the <span class="gemarra-regular">area </span>filled by<span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pillars </span>themselves, which was not included in the above tally. This yields a total of 135 cubits. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it enters your mind </span>to say that the <span class="it-text">mishnayot </span>in tractate <span class="gemarra-italic">Middot </span>are in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, do you find the altar in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">middle of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard? Most </span>of the<span class="gemarra-regular"> altar stands in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the southern </span>part of the courtyard. 

Daf 17a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>must one <span class="gemarra-regular">not conclude from it </span>that that the <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span> in tractate <span class="it-text">Middot</span> are in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov? </span>The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from it </span>that this is so. 
§ In an additional attempt to resolve the contradiction with regard to the Chamber of the Lambs, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda, son of Rav Yitzḥak, said: This chamber was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> remove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> from the corner, as it was not actually in the corner of the Hall of the Hearth but was located along the middle of the western side of the hall. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore, for one <span class="gemarra-regular">who comes from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">north, </span>the chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">appears to him </span>to be in the <span class="gemarra-regular">south </span>of the hall; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>for one <span class="gemarra-regular">who comes from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the south, </span>the chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">appears to him </span>to be in the <span class="gemarra-regular">north </span>of the hall. 
The Gemara comments: In any event, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is reasonable </span>to say that this chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>closer to the <span class="gemarra-regular">southwest </span>corner than it was to the northwest corner. <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>does one arrive at that conclusion? <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we raise a contradiction </span>between the mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Tamid</span>, where we learned that the chamber in which the <span class="gemarra-regular">shewbrea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> was prepared stood in the northeast corner, and the mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Middot</span>, where we learned that the chamber in which the <span class="gemarra-regular">shewbread </span>was prepared stood in the southeast corner. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we resolve </span>the contradiction based on what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: The Master </span>in tractate <span class="it-text">Middot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">envisions </span>the chambers as one coming <span class="gemarra-regular">via </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">right</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>from the south to the east, then to the north and then to the west. And <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master </span>in tractate <span class="it-text">Tamid</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">envisions </span>the chambers as one coming <span class="gemarra-regular">via </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">left</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> from the south to the west, then to the north and then to the east. Both agree with regard to the location of the chamber in which the shewbread was prepared; they merely describe that location from different perspectives. 

Daf 17b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that the Chamber of the Lambs <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>actually closer to the <span class="gemarra-regular">southwest </span>corner, that is how Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">resolves </span>the contradiction between one mishna discussing <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shewbread </span>and the other mishna discussing <span class="gemarra-regular">the shewbread. However, if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you say </span>that the Chamber of the Lambs <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">northwest </span>corner, <span class="gemarra-regular">ultimately, what is the resolution </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">shewbread? </span>Even if you envision the path from the other direction, the Chamber of the Seals interposes between the Chamber of the Lambs and the chamber where the shewbread is prepared. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>must one <span class="gemarra-regular">not conclude from it</span> that the Chamber of the Lambs <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> southwest? </span>The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from it </span>that this is so. 
The Gemara questions the assertion that one <span class="it-text">tanna</span> envisions the chambers as one coming via the left. <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t the Master say: All turns that you turn should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be only to the right, </span>which in certain cases is <span class="gemarra-regular">to the east? </span>Here the turns are to the left. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>restriction <span class="gemarra-regular">applies only in </span>the course of performing <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service; however, here, it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a mere reckoning, </span>and no priest actually proceeded that way from one chamber to the other. 
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">As the High Priest </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sacrifices </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">portion </span>that he chooses <span class="gemarra-regular">first and takes </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">portio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that he chooses <span class="gemarra-regular">first</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">How does </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrifice </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">portion </span>that he chooses <span class="gemarra-regular">first? </span>If the High Priest so desires, <span class="gemarra-regular">he says: This burnt-offering, I am sacrificing, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">This meal-offering, I am sacrificing. </span>That is sufficient, and the High Priest does not participate in a lottery. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">How does </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">portion </span>that he chooses <span class="gemarra-regular">first? </span>The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">says: This sin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offering, I am eating, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">This guilt-offering, I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">am eating. And he </span>may even <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">loaf </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">two loaves </span>offered on the festival of <span class="it-text">Shavuot</span>. He may take <span class="gemarra-regular">four or fiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the twelve <span class="gemarra-regular">shewbrea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">loaves </span>that are distributed to the priests every Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">always </span>takes <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>of the twelve shewbread loaves, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall be for Aaron and his sons </span>and they shall eat it in a sacred place” (Leviticus 24:9). From the fact that Aaron and his sons are listed separately, it is derived that <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of the loaves were given <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron, </span>or the High Priests who succeeded him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and half </span>were given <span class="gemarra-regular">to his sons. </span>Since, as explained below, only ten of the loaves were actually distributed, the High Priest received five.
<span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is itself difficult, </span>as it is self-contradictory. First <span class="gemarra-regular">you said: He takes </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">loaf </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">two loaves </span>offered on the festival of <span class="it-text">Shavuot</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is this? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">who said </span>that the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">takes half. Say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the middle clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as follows: The High Priest takes <span class="gemarra-regular">four or five </span>of the twelve <span class="gemarra-regular">shewbread loaves</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; we have come to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">does not take hal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f</span> but takes less than half. <span class="gemarra-regular">Say the last clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">always </span>takes <span class="gemarra-regular">five. </span>The Gemara asks: Is that to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause and the last clause</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> are in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the middle </span>clause is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis? </span>That conclusion is difficult.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: The first </span><span class="gemarra-regular">clause and the middle clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> are in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>and in the case of the two loaves, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis concede with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a piece </span>of a loaf <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is inappropriate</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to give it to the High Priest. </span>According to the Rabbis, the High Priest should actually receive less than one loaf, as in their opinion he is entitled to less than half; however, since it is inappropriate to give him a piece of the loaf, he takes an entire loaf as his portion. 

Daf 18a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">four or five; </span>i.e., when does the High Priest take four loaves and when does he take five? According <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Rabbis, who say: </span>The priestly watch that is <span class="gemarra-regular">incoming </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">takes six </span>of the loaves, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">outgoing </span>watch <span class="gemarra-regular">takes six, and </span>the incoming watch receives <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>greater portion as <span class="gemarra-regular">payment for closing the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">doors, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">from twelve </span>loaves that the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">must divide </span>and take his share, but he receives <span class="gemarra-regular">half</span> of the loaves <span class="gemarra-regular">less one, </span>meaning that <span class="gemarra-regular">he takes five</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>According to the Rabbis, the High Priest receives less than half; however, since it is inappropriate to give him a piece of a loaf, less than half is five whole loaves. 
According <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Yehuda, who said: </span>The priestly watch that is <span class="gemarra-regular">incoming </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">takes seven </span>of the loaves, <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>of which <span class="gemarra-regular">are payment for closing the doors; </span>and the <span class="gemarra-regular">outgoing</span> watch <span class="gemarra-regular">takes five </span>loaves, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">from ten </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must divide </span>the loaves. Those two of the twelve loaves are a separate payment and are not factored into the tally of those designated for distribution. <span class="gemarra-regular">Subtract one from half</span> of that total, as subtracting less than one loaf would lead to a situation where the High Priest receives a piece of a loaf, which is inappropriate. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore, the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">takes four. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should be explained differently. The <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>that only ten loaves are divided. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>then is the meaning of the statement that the High Priest takes <span class="gemarra-regular">four</span> loaves? According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">doesn’t he need</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to take five? </span>
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the High Priest takes four loaves is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is a watch that is detained</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>When the start of a Festival occurs on a Sunday night and one of the priestly watches was forced to arrive before Shabbat to ensure that they would arrive in time for the Festival; or, alternatively, if the Festival ended on a Thursday and one of the priestly watches was detained until the conclusion of Shabbat and only then departed, that priestly watch takes two loaves. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the High Priest takes five loaves is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is not a watch that is detained, </span>and the shewbread in divided only between the watch that concludes its service that Shabbat and the watch that begins its service that Shabbat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">If there is a watch that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is detained</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that detained watch takes two loaves, and the outgoing watch takes two loaves as payment for closing the doors. Therefore, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">from eight </span>that the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">must divide </span>the loaves, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">takes four. If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is not a watch that is detained, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">from ten </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he must divide </span>the loaves and the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">takes five.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>that even the middle statement of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is attributed to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and it is referring to a watch that is detained, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the meaning of the last clause in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">always </span>takes <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>loaves? That statement indicates that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi disagrees with the middle clause, while according to Rava’s interpretation Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi concedes that in certain circumstances the High Priest takes only four loaves. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult </span>to reconcile Rava’s interpretation with the language of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">provided </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> selected <span class="gemarra-regular">from the Elders of the court, and they </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">read before him the order </span>of the service <span class="gemarra-regular">of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day </span>of Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: My Master, High Priest. Read </span>the order of the service <span class="gemarra-regular">with your own mouth, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps you forgot </span>this reading <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps you did not learn </span>to read. <span class="gemarra-regular">On Yom</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Kippur eve </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">morning, </span>the Elders <span class="gemarra-regular">stand him at</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">eastern gate </span>of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and pass before him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bulls and rams and sheep so that he will be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> familiar </span>with the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>grow <span class="gemarra-regular">accustomed to the service</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as these were the animals sacrificed on Yom Kippur. Throughout <span class="gemarra-regular">all the seven days </span>that the High Priest was in the <span class="it-text">Parhedrin</span> chamber, <span class="gemarra-regular">they would not withhold from him </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">food or drink </span>that he desired. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">on Yom Kippur</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eve at nightfall, they would not allow him to eat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a great deal because food induces sleep </span>and they did not allow him to sleep, as will be explained. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara wonders about the depiction in the mishna of the Elders questioning the High Priest as to whether he forgot this reading or perhaps did not learn to read. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, perhaps he forgot, </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">fine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as it is conceivable that he is not accustomed to reading the Torah and might have forgotten this portion. <span class="gemarra-regular">However</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>is it conceivable that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learn </span>to read? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we appoint </span>a High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">of that sort </span>who never learned the Bible? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that it is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the priest who is greater than his brethren” </span>(Leviticus 21:10); this teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">be greater </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than his </span>priestly <span class="gemarra-regular">brethren in strength, in beauty, in wisdom, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and in wealth. </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Aḥerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: </span>Wealth is not a prerequisite for selecting a High Priest, but <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that if he does not have </span>property of his own <span class="gemarra-regular">that his brethren the priests elevate him </span>and render him wealthy from their own property? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And the priest who is greater [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">haggadol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] than his brethren”;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> elevate him [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gaddelehu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] from </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of his brethren. </span>In any event, there is a consensus that wisdom is a prerequisite for his selection.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. There, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that lists wisdom among the attributes of the High Priest is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the First Temple, </span>where this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> was observed and the High Priests possessed those attributes listed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>the mishna is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Second Temple, </span>where this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> was not observed, so a situation where the High Priest was not well-versed in the Bible was conceivable. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Asi said: </span>The wealthy <span class="gemarra-regular">Marta, daughter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Baitos, brought a half-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of dinars in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to King Yannai for </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that he appointed Yehoshua </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Gamla as High Priest. </span>This is an example of the appointment of High Priests by means of bribery and gifts. Since that was the practice, a totally ignorant High Priest could have been appointed.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">On Yom Kippur eve </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">morning, </span>the elders pass different animals before the High Priest. A <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught</span> in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even goats </span>were brought before him. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">our </span>mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not teach </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">goat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> were among the animals that passed before the High Priest? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>goats <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>as atonement <span class="gemarra-regular">for sins</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>passing them before the High Priest will evoke transgressions and he will <span class="gemarra-regular">become distraught. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, a bull </span>should be not be passed before him, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it too </span><span class="gemarra-regular">comes </span>to atone <span class="gemarra-regular">for sin. </span>The Gemara answers that there is a difference in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a bull, since</span> it is to atone <span class="gemarra-regular">for his </span>sins <span class="gemarra-regular">and for </span>the sins of <span class="gemarra-regular">his brethren the priests that it comes; among</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his brethren the priests, if there is a person who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has a </span>sinful <span class="gemarra-regular">matter, </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">would know </span>about it <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>lead <span class="gemarra-regular">him back to </span>the path of righteousness <span class="gemarra-regular">through repentance. </span>Therefore, passing a bull before the High Priest will not render him distraught, as it will merely remind him of his responsibility toward his priestly brethren. On the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the entire Jewish people, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he does not know </span>of their sinful matters and is unable to facilitate their repentance. Passing goats before the High Priest will evoke their sins as well as his inability to correct the situation, leaving him distraught. 
Apropos the High Priest being privy to the sinful behavior of his fellow priests, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>explains the folk saying <span class="gemarra-regular">that people say: If </span>the beloved <span class="gemarra-regular">son of your </span>beloved <span class="gemarra-regular">sister becomes a policeman [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dayyala</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> see </span>to it that <span class="gemarra-regular">in the marketplace you do not pass before him. </span>Be wary of him because he knows your sins.
§ We learned in the mishna: Throughout <span class="gemarra-regular">all the seven days </span>that the High Priest was in the <span class="it-text">Parhedrin</span> chamber, <span class="gemarra-regular">they would not withhold </span>from him any food or drink that he desired. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Nekosa says: </span>On Yom Kippur eve <span class="gemarra-regular">they feed him fine flour and eggs in order</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to loosen his </span>bowels, so that he will not need to relieve himself on Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to</span> Rabbi Yehuda ben Nekosa: In feeding him those foods, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so that you bring him to a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">state of arousal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Feeding him those foods is antithetical to the efforts to prevent the High Priest from becoming impure, as they are liable to cause him to experience a seminal emission.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Sumakhos said in the name of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Meir: One does not feed him </span>foods represented by the acrostic: <span class="gemarra-italic">Alef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yod</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and some say </span>that one does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>feed him foods represented by the acrostic: <span class="gemarra-italic">Alef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yod</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and some say neither </span>does one feed him <span class="gemarra-regular">white wine. </span>The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Not </span><span class="gemarra-italic">alef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yod</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">neither </span><span class="gemarra-italic">etrog</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, nor eggs [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beitzim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], nor old </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wine [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yayin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. And some say: Not </span><span class="gemarra-italic">alef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yod</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">neither </span><span class="gemarra-italic">etrog</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, nor eggs [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beitzim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], nor fatty </span><span class="gemarra-regular">meat [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">basar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], nor old wine [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yayin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. And some say neither </span>does one feed him <span class="gemarra-regular">white wine because white wine brings </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">man to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity </span>of a seminal emission. 
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught: </span>If a man experienced an emission that could render him <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one attributes </span>the emission not to his being a <span class="it-text">zav</span> but perhaps to a different cause, e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">to food</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or to all kinds of food, </span>i.e., he may have eaten too much food, which could have caused the emission. <span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar ben Pineḥas says in the name of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira: </span>During the days that a <span class="it-text">zav</span> is examining himself to determine whether or not he is impure, <span class="gemarra-regular">one feeds him neither </span>foods represented by the acrostic: <span class="gemarra-italic">Ḥet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gimmel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yod</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, nor </span>foods represented by the acrostic: <span class="gemarra-italic">Gimmel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor any </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">items </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>might <span class="gemarra-regular">bring him to impurity </span>caused by an emission. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Not </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gimmel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yod</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">neither</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> milk [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], nor cheese [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gevina</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], nor egg [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beitza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], nor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wine [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yayin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">].

The Gemara asks about the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">Nor any </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">items that </span>might <span class="gemarra-regular">bring </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him to impurity; what does it </span>come <span class="gemarra-regular">to include? It </span>comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to include that which the Sages taught: Five </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">items bring </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">man to </span>a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity </span>due to emission. <span class="gemarra-regular">And these are: Garlic, </span>

Daf 18b

<span class="gemarra-regular">cress</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> purslane</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eggs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and arugula</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Apropos the arugula plant, the Gemara cites a verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of them went out into the fields to collect </span><span class="gemarra-italic">orot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(II Kings 4:39). It was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught in the name </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Meir </span>with regard to <span class="it-text">orot</span> in this verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>the plant called <span class="gemarra-regular">arugula. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Why</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are </span>these arugula plants <span class="gemarra-regular">called </span><span class="gemarra-italic">orot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It is because <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enlighten [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">me’irot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the eyes. Rav Huna said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who finds arugula, if he can eat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it, he eats it, and if not, he passes it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">over his eyes, </span>as that too is beneficial. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Arugula </span>is most effective when it grows <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">border </span>of the field, where it is unadulterated by other plants. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Giddel said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: A guest </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">neither eat eggs, </span>because they lead to a seminal emission, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor sleep in a garment belonging </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the homeowner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> his host, because if he experiences a seminal emission and it gets on the garment, he will be diminished in the estimation of his host. Apropos conduct of a guest, theGemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">happen </span>to come <span class="gemarra-regular">to Darshis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he would declare: Who will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be </span>married to me <span class="gemarra-regular">for the day </span>that I am here so that I will not be unwed in this place, after which I will divorce her? Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman would come to Shekhantziv he would declare: Who will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be </span>married to me <span class="gemarra-regular">for the day </span>that I am here?
<span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> man should not marry a woman in one state and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> go and marry </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">woman in a different state</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lest </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">match be arranged </span>between the child of <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> wife <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the child of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>wife who are unaware of their relationship. This would <span class="gemarra-regular">lead to a brother marrying</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his sister </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">a father marrying his daughter, filling </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the whole world in its entirety with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mamzerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And concerning</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this it is stated: “And the land became filled with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lewdness” </span>(Leviticus 19:29). The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages generate publicity. </span>Since they were well-known, the identity of their children was also undoubtedly known. Therefore, there was no concern that errors of this kind would befall their children.
The Gemara raises a different problem with the practice of Rav and Rav Naḥman. <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rava say: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who proposed marriage to </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">and she agreed, </span>she <span class="gemarra-regular">is required to sit seven clean days, </span>as perhaps due to the anticipatory desire she might not notice that she experienced menstrual bleeding and she is therefore impure. How, then, could these <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> marry a woman on the day that they proposed? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages would inform</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them by sending messengers before </span>their arrival. The messenger would announce that the <span class="it-text">amora</span> sought to marry a local woman. The woman who agreed would in fact wait seven clean days before marrying him. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that these Sages were not actually proposing marriage; rather, they proposed so that they could <span class="gemarra-regular">be in seclusion with </span>the women, without consummating the relationship. Since the women knew that the marriage would not be consummated, they did not experience anticipatory desire. <span class="gemarra-regular">There is no similarity between one who has bread in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his basket and one who does not have bread in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his basket. </span>One who does not have access to bread experiences hunger more acutely than one for whom bread is available and can eat whenever he chooses. Similarly, an unmarried man experiences a more acute desire. In order to mitigate that desire, these Sages made certain that women would be designated for them. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Elders of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the court </span>who read the order of the service of the day before the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">passed him to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elders of the priesthood, and they took him up to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the House of Avtinas. And they administered him an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">oat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and took leave </span>of him <span class="gemarra-regular">and went on their way</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>When they administered this oath <span class="gemarra-regular">they said to him: My</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Master, High Priest. We are agents of the court, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you are our agent and the agent of the court</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. We administer an oath to you in </span>the name of <span class="gemarra-regular">Him who housed His name in this House, that you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will not change </span>even one <span class="gemarra-regular">matter from all that we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have said to you </span>with regard to the burning of the incense or any other service that you will perform when alone. After this oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would leave </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">and cry, and they would leave </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">and cry </span>in sorrow that the oath was necessary. 
They kept him occupied throughout the night to prevent him from sleeping. <span class="gemarra-regular">If he was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a scholar, he </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>Torah. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he was <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> a scholar, <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah scholars </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">before him. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>he was <span class="gemarra-regular">accustomed to read </span>the Bible, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">read</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and if </span>he was <span class="gemarra-regular">not, they </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">read </span>the Bible <span class="gemarra-regular">before him. And what </span>books would <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">read before him </span>to pique his interest so that he would not fall asleep? They would read <span class="gemarra-regular">from Job, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from Ezra, and from Chronicles. Zekharya, son of Kevutal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Many times I read before him from </span>the book of <span class="gemarra-regular">Daniel. </span>

Daf 19a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span>The Sages took the High Priest to the House of Avtinas, where the incense was prepared, <span class="gemarra-regular">to teach him </span>the method of <span class="gemarra-regular">taking handful</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of incense, which is a difficult and complex skill. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: The High Priest had two chambers. One </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Parhedrin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> chamber and one </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber of the House </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Avtinas. One </span>of them was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the north </span>of the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the south. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>was in <span class="gemarra-regular">the north, as we learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">There were six chambers in the </span>Israelite <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> three in the north and three in the south.</span>
The chambers <span class="gemarra-regular">in the south </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber of the Salt, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Parva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rinsers. </span>The Gemara explains the function performed in each chamber. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Chamber of the Salt </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place the salt for the offering </span>in storage <span class="gemarra-regular">The Chamber </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Parva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the hides, was <span class="gemarra-regular">where they salted the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> consecrated hides </span>that belonged to the priests, to prevent them from spoiling. <span class="gemarra-regular">And on the roof </span>of that chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Hall of Immersion for the High Priest for Yom</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Kippur. The Chamber of the Rinsers </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">where they would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rinse the innards of consecrated </span>animals, which were not taken up to the altar while dirty or with undigested food remaining in them. <span class="gemarra-regular">From there a circular staircase ascended </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the roof of the Chamber of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Parva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
The <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>chambers <span class="gemarra-regular">in the north </span>of the courtyard were <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber of the Wood, the Chamber</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Exile, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber of Hewn Stone</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber of the Wood, Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Ya’akov, </span>who is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span> in tractate <span class="it-text">Middot</span> in which this mishna appears, <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I forgot what </span>purpose that chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">would serve. Abba Shaul </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: The High Priest’s chamber was behind the two </span>chambers, the Chamber of the Exile and the Chamber of Hewn Stone, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the roofs of </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">three of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them were level. </span>As the three were attached, they shared a roof. 
In <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber of the Exile there was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the well </span>excavated by those returning from <span class="gemarra-regular">exile, </span>for which the chamber was named, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the wheel </span>with which water was drawn <span class="gemarra-regular">was positioned over it. And from there, </span>they would <span class="gemarra-regular">supply water for </span>use <span class="gemarra-regular">in the entire </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard </span>for washing and rinsing. In <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber of Hewn </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Stone, there </span>the great <span class="gemarra-regular">Sanhedrin of Israel convened and judged </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">the priests </span>were fit for service. A priest <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whom a disqualification was detected </span>due to a blemish or lineage <span class="gemarra-regular">would wear black and would wrap himself in black </span>in a display of sorrow and mourning <span class="gemarra-regular">and would emerge </span>from the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">and go </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">his way, </span>because he was not fit for service as a priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>any priest <span class="gemarra-regular">in whom a disqualification was not found would wear</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> white and wrap himself in white </span>in a display of joy <span class="gemarra-regular">and would enter and serve with his fellow priests</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
In any event, it was taught that there was a chamber of the High Priest in the north of the courtyard, and there is proof that he also had <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> south </span>of the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Seven gates were in the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> three </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the north and three in the south and one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the east. </span>The gates <span class="gemarra-regular">in the south </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gate of Fire; second to it </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">the Gate of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> third to it </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">the Gate of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Water. </span>The gate <span class="gemarra-regular">that was in the east </span>was called the <span class="gemarra-regular">Gate of Nicanor, and two chambers were there </span>next to the Gate of Nicanor, <span class="gemarra-regular">one to its right and one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to its left. One </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber of Pineḥas the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Dresser, </span>where the priestly vestments were stored, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber of the Preparers of the Griddle-Cake Offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>where the daily griddle-cake offering was prepared on behalf of the High Priest.
The gates <span class="gemarra-regular">that were in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the north: </span>The first was <span class="gemarra-regular">the Gate of the Spark</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which was <span class="gemarra-regular">a portico building, </span>meaning it had a roof but was not completely closed on every side. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a second story built atop it, and there </span>the honor guard of the Temple stood, with <span class="gemarra-regular">the priests </span><span class="gemarra-regular">guarding from above </span>and the <span class="gemarra-regular">Levites from below. Inside of </span>this gate was <span class="gemarra-regular">the rampart, </span>and an opening led from the gate to the rampart. <span class="gemarra-regular">Second to </span>this gate was <span class="gemarra-regular">the Gate </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the Offering; third to it was the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Gate of the Hall of the Hearth. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it was taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The High Priest would </span>perform <span class="gemarra-regular">five immersion</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and ten sanctifications </span>of his hands and feet <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that day, </span>Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">And each of these </span>was performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in the sacred </span>area of the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">roof of the Hall of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Parva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, except for this </span>first immersion, <span class="gemarra-regular">which was </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in the non-sacred </span>area outside the courtyard. The first immersion was not unique to Yom Kippur but was performed every day by any priest entering the Temple. That immersion was performed <span class="gemarra-regular">on the roof </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the Gate of the Water, </span>and that gate <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">alongside his chamber. </span>Apparently, the High Priest had a chamber next to the Gate of the Water, which was in the south of the courtyard.
The High Priest had use of two chambers, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we do not know whether the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Parhedrin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> chamber was in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the north and the Chamber of the House of Avtinas </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was in the south, or the Chamber of the House </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Avtinas was in the north and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Parhedrin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> chamber </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was in the south. And, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is reasonable </span>to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Parhedrin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> chamber was in the south </span>and the High Priest slept there. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the reason </span>for that assumption? Because if that is the case, the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">arises early </span>every morning of the seven days of sequestering <span class="gemarra-regular">and he covers his legs, </span>a euphemism for defecating, <span class="gemarra-regular">and immerses </span>alongside his chamber, which was in the south. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>then he <span class="gemarra-regular">walks to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">north </span>of the courtyard to the second chamber, which is the Chamber of the House of Avtinas, <span class="gemarra-regular">and learns </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>method of <span class="gemarra-regular">taking handfuls. And </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he comes to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Temple and performs the service for the entire day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Toward the evening they sprinkle </span>purification water <span class="gemarra-regular">upon him, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and he then walks </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">to the south and immerses </span>again alongside his chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">and rests </span>in his chamber. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">As, if you say </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">Chamber of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Parhedrin</span> was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the north, </span>this would mean that the High Priest would be forced to exert himself and walk significant distances. According to this understanding, <span class="gemarra-regular">he arises early, and he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> covers his legs. </span>However, since it was taught in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the place of his immersion was in the south, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">walks to the south and immerses. And</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">he learns </span>the method of <span class="gemarra-regular">taking handfuls. And </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he comes to the Temple and performs the service for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the entire day. Toward the evening they sprinkle </span>purification water <span class="gemarra-regular">upon him, and he then walks </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">south and immerses, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he needs to walk back </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the north and rest. Do we impose </span>upon <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to that extent? </span>Rather, it is reasonable to say that the <span class="it-text">Parhedrin</span> chamber, the High Priest’s private chamber, was in the south, which would limit the distance that he needed to walk.
The Gemara rejects this reasoning: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why not </span>impose upon him? On the contrary, <span class="gemarra-regular">we impose upon him </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">more, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that if he is a Sadducee, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will retire. </span>As he is not a God-fearing person, he would prefer to walk away rather than subject himself to that added exertion. That is a desirable result, ridding the High Priesthood of a Sadducee. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or, alternatively, </span>there is even value in imposing on a God-fearing Pharisee High Priest, as it <span class="gemarra-regular">so that he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will not become haughty </span>in his lofty position. Since he is occupied in performing his task, he does not have leisure to be impressed with his elevated status. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you do not say </span>that it is an intentional attempt to impose upon him, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us establish both of </span>the chambers of the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">next to one another; or, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">alternatively, one </span>chamber would be <span class="gemarra-regular">sufficient for him. </span>From the fact that neither of these alternatives is adopted, it is apparently an intentional attempt to impose upon him, and there is no proof as to the location of either of the chambers of the High Priest.
§ It was taught in the mishna that the Elders <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: My Master</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, High Priest. </span>We are agents of the court, and you are our agent and the agent of the court. The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that this is a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">conclusive refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehoshua, as Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">These priests </span>who sacrifice the offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">are the agents of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> They are not agents representing the Jewish people but are agents representing God, as He commanded them to perform the service. Proof is cited for this opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if you say they are our agents, </span>

Daf 19b

<span class="gemarra-regular">is there any matter that we are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unable to perform and our agents are able to perform? </span>The role of the agent is to perform a task on behalf of the one who commissioned him. The agent cannot perform a task that the one who commissioned him is unable to perform. Since it is prohibited for Israelites to enter the priests’ courtyard and to perform the sacrificial rites, clearly the priests are not agents representing the Israelites. The language of the mishna in which the court Elders address the High Priest as their agent apparently contradicts that understanding. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what they say to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: We administer an oath to you according to our </span><span class="gemarra-regular">understanding and the understanding of the court, </span>cautioning him that he cannot rationalize violating the oath by claiming that he took the oath based on his own interpretation. He is bound by the understanding of the court. The mishna does not address the nature of the High Priest’s agency. 
§ The mishna continues: After this oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would leave </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">and cry</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they would leave </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">and cry</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">He turned aside and cried </span>due to the indignity <span class="gemarra-regular">that they suspected him </span>of being <span class="gemarra-regular">a Sadducee; and they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> turned aside and cried, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: One who suspects the innocent </span>of indiscretion <span class="gemarra-regular">is afflicted in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his body. </span>The High Priest might in fact be beyond reproach and they may have suspected him falsely. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why</span> were the Elders <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>insistent that the High Priest take an oath? The Gemara explains: So that <span class="gemarra-regular">he would not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prepare </span>the incense and light it <span class="gemarra-regular">outsid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in the Sanctuary, before entering the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">and bring </span>the coal pan with the incense already burning on it <span class="gemarra-regular">into</span> the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">in the manner </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sadducees</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did. </span>Since the High Priest is alone inside the Sanctuary and there is no way to ascertain whether he is in fact performing the service in the proper manner, the Elders insisted that he take an oath to perform it according to their instructions. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving a </span>certain <span class="gemarra-regular">Sadducee </span>who was appointed as High Priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">who prepared the incense outside </span>and then <span class="gemarra-regular">brought </span>it into the Holy of Holies. <span class="gemarra-regular">Upon his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> emergence he was overjoyed </span>that he had succeeded. <span class="gemarra-regular">The father</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>that Sadducee <span class="gemarra-regular">met him and said to him: My</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son, although we are Sadducees </span>and you performed the service in accordance with our opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">we fear the Pharisees </span>and do not actually implement that procedure in practice. The son <span class="gemarra-regular">said to his </span>father: <span class="gemarra-regular">All my days I have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">been troubled over this verse: “For I will appear in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cloud above the Ark cover” </span>(Leviticus 16:2). The Sadducees interpreted this verse to mean that God will appear above the Ark cover, i.e., will enter the Holy of Holies, only after the incense cloud is already there. <span class="gemarra-regular">I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: When will </span>the opportunity <span class="gemarra-regular">become available to me, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I will fulfill it </span>according to the Sadducee interpretation? <span class="gemarra-regular">Now</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>the opportunity <span class="gemarra-regular">has become available to me, </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not fulfill it? </span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Not </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">a few days </span>passed <span class="gemarra-regular">until he died</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and was laid out in the garbage </span>dump, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">worms were coming out of his nos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in punishment for his actions. <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he was struck </span>as soon <span class="gemarra-regular">as he emerged </span>from the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: A type of sound was heard in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, as an angel came and struck him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the face. And his fellow priests came in </span>to remove him from there <span class="gemarra-regular">and they found the likeness of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a footprint of a calf between his shoulders. </span>That is the mark left by an angel striking, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is stated </span>with regard to angels: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And their feet were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> straight feet, and the sole of their feet was like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the sole of a calf’s foot” </span>(Ezekiel 1:7). 
§ It was taught in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zekharya ben Kevutal </span>says: Many times I read before the High Priest from the book of Daniel. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥanan bar Rava taught this to Ḥiyya bar Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Rav </span>in the following manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zekharya bar Kefutal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said, and Rav demonstrated with his han</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that the name should be pronounced <span class="gemarra-regular">Kevutal. </span>The Gemara asks: Why did Rav demonstrate his point with a gesture? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him </span>simply <span class="gemarra-regular">say it. </span>The Gemara answers: Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">was reciting </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shema</span> at that moment and could not interrupt <span class="it-text">Shema</span> by speaking. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is </span>interrupting in a manner <span class="gemarra-regular">of that sort, </span>by gesturing, <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>during <span class="it-text">Shema</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Marta say: One who is reciting </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shema</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should neither</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> make allusions with his eyes, nor open and close </span>his mouth <span class="gemarra-regular">with his lips </span>to convey a message, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gesture with his fingers? And it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar Ḥisma says: Concerning one who recites </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shema</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and makes allusions with his eyes, or opens and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">closes </span>his mouth <span class="gemarra-regular">with his lips, or gestures with his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fingers, the verse says: “And you did not call out </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Me, O Jacob” </span>(Isaiah 43:22). By signaling while reciting <span class="it-text">Shema</span> he behaves contemptuously toward God, and it is tantamount to not having recited <span class="it-text">Shema</span> before Him. How, then, could Rav gesture while reading <span class="it-text">Shema</span>? 
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>prohibition to interrupt one’s recitation of <span class="it-text">Shema</span> with a gesture applies <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the course of reciting the <span class="gemarra-regular">first paragraph </span>of <span class="it-text">Shema</span>, which is more fundamental; <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case where Rav gestured was <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the course of reciting the <span class="gemarra-regular">second paragraph </span>of <span class="it-text">Shema</span>, where gesturing to convey a significant message is permitted. 
Apropos interruptions in the course of reciting <span class="it-text">Shema</span>, the Gemara cites a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in which <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught: </span>“And these words, which I command you this day, shall be upon your heart; and you shall teach them diligently unto your children, <span class="gemarra-regular">and you shall talk of them </span>when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you arise” (Deuteronomy 6:6–7). This means that in the course <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>reciting <span class="gemarra-regular">them,</span> the study of Torah and the recitation of <span class="it-text">Shema</span>, it is permitted to interrupt to state a significant matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>in the course <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>reciting the <span class="it-text">Amida</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">prayer, </span>which may not be interrupted for any kind of speech. Another interpretation of the verse is: <span class="gemarra-regular">And you shall talk of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them </span>is to emphasize that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted </span>to interrupt <span class="it-text">Shema</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to speak these matters </span>of Torah, but not to speak <span class="gemarra-regular">other matters </span>that may lead to levity. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Aḥa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: Talk of them </span>means one must <span class="gemarra-regular">render them, </span>the words of Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">a permanent </span>fixture, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not render </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them a temporary </span>exercise. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: One who engages in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">idle chatte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> without Torah or any particular purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">violates </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">positive </span>commandment, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: And you shall talk</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of them; </span>talk <span class="gemarra-regular">of them and not of other </span><span class="gemarra-regular">matters. Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: </span>Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">violates a negative </span>commandment, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “All </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these matters are wearisome; no man can ever state them” </span>(Ecclesiastes 1:7). The phrase: No man can ever state them, is understood as a prohibition against engaging in idle chatter. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">sought to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">slee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> at night, <span class="gemarra-regular">the young priests </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">snap the middle [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzerada</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] finger </span>against the thumb <span class="gemarra-regular">before him, and they </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him</span> every so often: <span class="gemarra-regular">My Master, High Priest. Stand </span>from your bed <span class="gemarra-regular">and chill </span>yourself <span class="gemarra-regular">once on the floor </span>and overcome your drowsiness. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">engage him </span>in various ways <span class="gemarra-regular">until the time would arrive to slaughter the </span>daily offering. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span> is the <span class="gemarra-italic">tzerada</span> finger mentioned in the mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: It is the rival [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of that [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">da</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>one. Which finger <span class="gemarra-regular">is it? </span><span class="it-text">Tzerada</span> is the rival of <span class="gemarra-regular">the thumb; </span>it is the middle finger. The middle finger would be strongly positioned against the thumb, and when one separates them, the finger hits the palm, creating a sound. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna demonstrated </span>the loud noise that could be achieved by snapping with the middle finger, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the sound</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> traveled throughout Rav’s study hall. </span>The sound created was loud enough to keep the High Priest awake. 
It was taught in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">they said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: My Master, High Priest. </span>Stand from your bed and <span class="gemarra-regular">chill</span> yourself <span class="gemarra-regular">once on the floor </span>and overcome your drowsiness. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yitzḥak said </span>that they said to the High Priest: <span class="gemarra-regular">Introduce something new</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is it </span>that they asked him to introduce? <span class="gemarra-regular">They say to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Demonstrate </span>how to perform the ceremonial <span class="gemarra-regular">bowing </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">kidda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This was a form of bowing that was difficult to perform, in which the High Priest was expert. The thought was that the exercise would keep him awake. 
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And they</span> would <span class="gemarra-regular">engage him </span>in different ways <span class="gemarra-regular">until the time to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> slaughter the </span>daily offering <span class="gemarra-regular">would arrive. </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">They would not occupy him with a har</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lyre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which may not be played on a Festival, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>would sing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">mouths. And what would they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say? </span>They would say this verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Unless the Lord</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> builds the house, its builders labor in vain on it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchman keeps vigil in vain” (Psalms 127:1). The message to the High Priest was that his service must be performed for the sake of Heaven for it to be accepted by God; otherwise his efforts would be in vain. 
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">the prominent </span>men <span class="gemarra-regular">of Jerusalem would not sleep the entire night </span>but instead engaged in Torah study, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hear </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sound of noise </span>in the city <span class="gemarra-regular">and sleep</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would not overcome him </span>in the silence of the sleeping city. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Shaul</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: They would do so even in the outlying areas</span> and stay awake all night <span class="gemarra-regular">in acknowledgment of the Temple</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; however, </span>the result was <span class="gemarra-regular">that they would sin, </span>as the men and women would participate in games together to pass the time, leading to transgression. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</span> who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Interpret </span>that statement as referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Neharde’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as Elijah </span>the Prophet <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rav Yehuda, brother </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Salla Ḥasida: You have said </span>and wondered: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has the Messiah not come? </span>Why is that surprising? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t today Yom Kippur, and relations were had with several </span><span class="gemarra-regular">virgins in Neharde’a, </span>as the men and women stayed awake all night and that led to promiscuity? Rav Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What did the Holy One, Blessed be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He, say </span>about those sins committed by the Jewish people? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said: </span>This is what God said: 

Daf 20a

<span class="gemarra-regular">“Sin lies</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in waiting at the door” </span>(Genesis 4:7), and it is no wonder that men sin. He asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what did Satan </span>the prosecutor <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>about their sinning? <span class="gemarra-regular">Elijah </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Satan, on Yom Kippur, has no license</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to prosecute</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> From where </span>is that idea derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Ḥama said: The numerological value </span>of the letters that constitute the word <span class="gemarra-italic">HaSatan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is three hundred and sixty four</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span><span class="it-text">Heh</span> has a value of five, <span class="it-text">sin</span> has a value of three hundred, <span class="it-text">tet</span> has a value of nine, and <span class="it-text">nun</span> has a value of fifty. <span class="gemarra-regular">Three hundred and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sixty-four days </span>of the solar year, which is three hundred and sixty-five days long, Satan <span class="gemarra-regular">has license to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prosecute. </span>On the remaining day, <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur, he has no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> license to prosecute</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since that day is exalted above all others, there is no room for the accusations of Satan. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Every</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day </span>the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">would remove </span>the ashes <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">alta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> and place them on the east side of the ramp <span class="gemarra-regular">at the crow of the rooster or adjacent to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it, whether before it or after it, </span>as there was no insistence on a precise time. <span class="gemarra-regular">And on Yom Kippur</span> they would remove the ashes earlier, <span class="gemarra-regular">from midnight </span>onward. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the Festivals, </span>the ashes were removed even earlier, at the end of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first watch. And the call of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the rooster would not arrive </span>on Festivals <span class="gemarra-regular">until the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard was full with the Jewish people </span>who vowed to bring offerings and would fulfill their obligations on the Festivals. Those offerings were sacrificed immediately following the daily offering. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in tractate <span class="it-text">Zevaḥim</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">limbs</span> from offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">that were forced off the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">alta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> by the heat of the fire, if they fell <span class="gemarra-regular">before midnight, </span>these limbs remain sacred; the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">should return </span>them to the fire, and one is liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse of consecrated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> property </span>for deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from them. </span>If they fell <span class="gemarra-regular">after midnight, </span>the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">should not return </span>them to the fire, and one is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse of consecrated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">property </span>for deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from them; </span>they are considered like ashes. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these matters </span>derived that midnight determines the end of the burning period for limbs, after which they assume the legal status of ashes? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: One verse says: </span>“It is the burnt-offering that goes up on its firewood upon the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">all night </span>until morning” (Leviticus 6:2) <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he shall burn it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> indicating that the sacrificial limbs may be burned throughout the night. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one verse says: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">All night…and he shall remove </span>the ashes” (Leviticus 6:2–3), meaning that the ashes may be removed throughout the night. <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>can these texts be reconciled? Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">divide </span>the night into two sections: <span class="gemarra-regular">Half of it for burning </span>the limbs, <span class="gemarra-regular">and half of it for removal </span>of the ashes. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana raised an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">objection. </span>It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Every day </span>the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">would remove the ashes from the alta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> crow of the rooster or adjacent to it, whether before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it or after it, and on Yom Kippur from midnight</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and on the Festivals </span>from the end of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> watch. </span>

Daf 20b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enters your mind </span>to say that the time for removal of the ashes is <span class="gemarra-regular">from midnight by Torah law, how</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do we </span>perform it <span class="gemarra-regular">earlier and how do we </span>perform it <span class="gemarra-regular">later </span>than the time established by Torah law? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>The fact that midnight is the deadline after which the limbs may not be burned is derived from a different source. <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is stated </span>with regard to the burning of the limbs: <span class="gemarra-regular">All night, don’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I know that it </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">until morning? And </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span> purpose, then, <span class="gemarra-regular">does the verse state: Until morning? </span>It means: <span class="gemarra-regular">Add </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">morning to the morning of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">night. </span>Arise before dawn, and that is the time for removal of the ashes. Nevertheless, there is no specific hour fixed for performing this removal, and how much earlier than dawn it is performed depends on the need.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, every day </span>the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">remove the ashes from the altar at the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">crow of the rooster or adjacent to it, whether before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it or after it, </span>as on a typical day removing the ashes just before dawn is <span class="gemarra-regular">sufficient. On Yom Kippur,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when, </span>due to the fact that he performs the entire day’s service, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>an issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">the weakness</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the High Priest, </span>the ashes are removed earlier <span class="gemarra-regular">and we do so from midnight. And on the Festivals, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">when the Jewish people </span>in Jerusalem <span class="gemarra-regular">are numerous and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">offerings </span>that they bring to sacrifice during the Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">numerous, </span>the ashes are removed even earlier, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so from the first watch, in accordance with the reason </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is taught </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the call of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the rooster would not arrive </span>on Festivals <span class="gemarra-regular">until the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard was full with the Jewish people.</span>
§ The term <span class="it-text">keriat</span> <span class="it-text">hagever</span>, translated above as the call of the rooster, is mentioned in the mishna as an indication of a certain time. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the phrase <span class="gemarra-italic">keriat</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">hagever</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rav said: It is the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> call of the man; </span>the priest appointed for this task proclaimed that it was time for the priests to report for service. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Sheil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: It is the call </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the rooster</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is also called <span class="it-text">gever</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav happened </span>to come <span class="gemarra-regular">to the place </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Sheila </span>was the most prominent local Torah scholar and Rav was not yet known. <span class="gemarra-regular">There was no disseminato</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to stand before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Sheila </span>to disseminate his lecture to the public. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stood before him </span>to disseminate the lecture, in the course of which Rabbi Sheila mentioned <span class="it-text">keriat</span> <span class="it-text">hagever</span>. Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">interpreted </span>the concept for the audience and said: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-italic">keriat</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">hagever</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">the call of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">man. Rabbi Sheila said to him: And let the Master</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the call of the rooster. </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him, </span>quoting a folk saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">A flute </span>played <span class="gemarra-regular">for noblemen </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">music, but </span>when played for <span class="gemarra-regular">weavers, </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">receive no </span>pleasure <span class="gemarra-regular">from it, </span>due to their lack of sophistication. Similarly, the interpretation that I disseminated was accepted by Torah scholars greater than you. You, who lack their sophistication, cannot appreciate it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">When I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stood before Rabbi Ḥiyya and interpreted: What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-italic">keriat</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">hagever</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">the call of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">man, he did not say anything to me </span>in response, <span class="gemarra-regular">and you, </span>Rabbi Sheila, <span class="gemarra-regular">say to me: Say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the call of the rooster. </span>As soon as Rabbi Sheila heard that, he knew at once who had been disseminating his lecture. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: Is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Master Rav? Let the Master rest </span>and cease disseminating my lecture, as it is beneath your dignity to serve as my assistant. Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: People say </span>this aphorism: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you hired yourself to him, comb his wool</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Once one agrees to perform a task, he should bear its less pleasing aspects and complete the job. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, this is what </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: One elevates </span>to a higher level <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>matters of <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctity and one does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not downgrade</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since the task of interpreting was undertaken by a man of my stature, it is not fitting that a lesser man will replace me. That would be a display of contempt for the Torah.
The Gemara comments: A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav, </span>and a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Sheila</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara elaborates: A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught in accordance with</span> the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav: What did Gevin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">Crier, </span>who was an appointee in the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in his proclamation? <span class="gemarra-regular">Arise, priests, to your service, and Levites to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your platform, and Israelites to your </span>non-priestly <span class="gemarra-regular">watch. And </span>the Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">His voice was </span>so strong that it could <span class="gemarra-regular">be heard at </span>a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">three parasangs, </span>slightly more than eight miles.
There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving King Agrippa, who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was coming down the road and heard </span>Gevini the Crier’s <span class="gemarra-regular">voice at a distance of three parasangs. And when</span> the king <span class="gemarra-regular">came to his house he sent gifts to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him, </span>since he was so impressed with the man’s voice. The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And even so, </span>the voice of the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest </span>was stronger and <span class="gemarra-regular">superior to his</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as the Master said: And </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">already was </span>an incident where the High Priest recited, in his confession that accompanied the placing of hands on his bull on Yom Kippur: <span class="gemarra-regular">Please God, and his voice was heard in Jericho. And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabba bar bar Ḥana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>The distance <span class="gemarra-regular">from Jerusalem to Jericho </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">ten parasangs. </span>
And not only was the distance greater in the case of the High Priest than in the case of Gevini the Crier, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, there is </span>the issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">the weakness </span>of the High Priest due to the fast and his obligation to perform the entire service, while <span class="gemarra-regular">there, there is no </span>issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">the weakness of </span>Gevini. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in addition, <span class="gemarra-regular">here it was </span>during the <span class="gemarra-regular">day, </span>when sound does not travel as well, that the High Priest recited his confession; <span class="gemarra-regular">and there it was </span>during the <span class="gemarra-regular">night </span>when Gevini called the priests, Levites, and Israelites.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Levi said: Why is a person’s voice</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not heard during the day in the manner that it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is during the night? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that the sound of the <span class="gemarra-regular">sphere of the sun traversing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the sky </span>generates noise <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the noise generated by <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> carpenter sawing cedars, </span>and that noise drowns out other sounds. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that sawdust </span>that is visible during <span class="gemarra-regular">the day </span>in the rays of the sun, <span class="gemarra-italic">la</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is its name. This </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">Nebuchadnezzar said: “And all the inhabitants of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">world are considered like </span><span class="gemarra-italic">la</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Daniel 4:32), i.e., all inhabitants of the earth are equivalent to specks of dust.
Apropos sounds, the Gemara cites that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught: Were it not </span>for the sound of the <span class="gemarra-regular">sphere of the sun, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sound of </span>the bustle of <span class="gemarra-regular">the crowds of Rom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> would be <span class="gemarra-regular">heard </span>throughout the world; <span class="gemarra-regular">and were it not for the sound of</span> the bustle of <span class="gemarra-regular">the crowds of Rome, the sound of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the sun’s sphere </span>would be <span class="gemarra-regular">heard </span>throughout the world. And <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught: Three sounds trave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> end of the world to its </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">end</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these are: The sound of the sphere of the sun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sound of </span>the bustle of <span class="gemarra-regular">the crowds of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rome, and the sound of the soul at the moment</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that it leaves the body, </span>which should be audible throughout the world. <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say: Even </span>the sound of a woman giving <span class="gemarra-regular">birth. </span>

Daf 21a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">some say: </span>The sound of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ridy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as well. </span>Ridya is the angel tasked with irrigating the earth, who calls to the heavens and to the aquifers to provide their water. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Sages asked for merc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> so that the sound of <span class="gemarra-regular">the soul at the moment</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that it leaves the body </span>would no longer be heard to that extent, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>God <span class="gemarra-regular">eliminated it. </span>In any event, clearly this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> understands <span class="it-text">keriat</span> <span class="it-text">hagever</span> as the proclamation of the Temple crier, in support of the opinion of Rav.
A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Sheila: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sets out on the path </span>at night <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span><span class="gemarra-italic">keriat</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">hageve</span><span class="gemarra-italic">r</span> and is killed by demons, <span class="gemarra-regular">his blood</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is on his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">head, </span>i.e., he is at fault. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoshiya says: </span>The prohibition of traveling at night is in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the rooster crows <span class="gemarra-regular">twice. And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">some say: Until he </span>crows <span class="gemarra-regular">three times. And with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to what rooster did </span>these Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">state </span>this advisory? It is with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a rooster </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">medium </span>size. Clearly, this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> understands <span class="it-text">keriat</span> <span class="it-text">hagever</span> as the crow of the rooster. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: When the Jewish people</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ascend </span>to Jerusalem <span class="gemarra-regular">for the pilgrimage </span>Festivals <span class="gemarra-regular">they stand crowded</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but </span>when they <span class="gemarra-regular">bow </span>during confession they are <span class="gemarra-regular">spaced </span>so that no one hears the confession of another. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>due to the large crowd <span class="gemarra-regular">they extend eleven cubits behind the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Hall of the Ark Cover</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the Holy of Holies. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is he saying </span>in the reference to eleven cubits behind the Holy of Holies? The Gemara explains that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what he is saying: Even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">though </span>the crowd is so large that the people <span class="gemarra-regular">extend </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eleven cubits behind the Hall of the Ark Cover and </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">stand crowded, </span>still, <span class="gemarra-regular">when they bow, they bow spaced. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And that is one of the ten miracles that were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">performed in the Temple</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ten miracles were performed in the Temple. No </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woman miscarried from the aroma of the sacrificial meat, </span>as a pregnant woman craves various foods and occasionally that craving leads to miscarriage. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the sacrificial meat never putrefied</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And no fly was seen in the slaughterhouse, </span>although flies are generally attracted to a place where there is flesh and blood. <span class="gemarra-regular">And a seminal emission did not befall the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> High Priest on Yom Kippur. And no disqualification was found</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">omer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or the two loaves, </span>which are communal offerings, <span class="gemarra-regular">or in the shewbread. </span>And the Jewish people <span class="gemarra-regular">stand crowded but bow spaced. And neither a snake nor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a scorpio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ever harmed </span>anyone <span class="gemarra-regular">in Jerusalem. And a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">person never said to another: There is no room for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me to stay overnight in Jerusalem.</span>
The Gemara notes: This list <span class="gemarra-regular">opened </span>with miracles that occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Temple, and closed </span>with miracles that occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">in Jerusalem. </span>Apparently there were not actually ten miracles performed in the Temple. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There are two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> other </span>miracles <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Temple, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rain never extinguished the fire of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">arrangement of wood </span>on the altar, despite the fact that the altar stood in the courtyard, exposed to the elements. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the smoke of the arrangement</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even if all the winds in the world come and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">blow it, they do not move it from its place </span>and it rises directly heavenward. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And are there no more </span>miracles in the Temple? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rav Shemaya teach </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Kalnevo: Shards of earthenware vessels were swallowed</span> in the earth <span class="gemarra-regular">in their places, </span>and there was no need to dispose of them. The vessels used for cooking the meat of the offerings of the most sacred order absorbed some of the meat. The meat that was absorbed became <span class="it-text">notar</span> when the period during which the offering may be eaten concludes. One was required to break those vessels in which the meat was absorbed. The shards of those vessels were miraculously swallowed in the earth where they were smashed. And similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: The crop and feathers </span>of sacrificial birds, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the ashes of the inner altar, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the ashes of the candelabrum, </span>which were not removed to the place of ashes outside the Temple like the ashes of the outer altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">swallowed </span>in the earth <span class="gemarra-regular">in their places. </span>Apparently, there were more than ten miracles in the Temple. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The disqualifications </span>mentioned that never occurred in the Temple, in the <span class="it-text">omer</span>, the two loaves, or the shewbread, <span class="gemarra-regular">were three; consider them as on</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> miracle. <span class="gemarra-regular">Eliminate two </span>from the total <span class="gemarra-regular">and introduce </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span> to complete the list of ten miracles. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>similar miracles are combined and considered as one, <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> swallowing </span>of the earthenware, crops, feathers, and ashes <span class="gemarra-regular">are also</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two </span>similar miracles that should be <span class="gemarra-regular">considered as one, </span>the result being that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are lacking </span>one miracle to complete the total of ten. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">also another </span>miracle, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">great miracle was performed with regard to the shewbread </span>in the Temple, that the bread was as hot at <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">removal </span>on Shabbat, after a week on the table, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it was at <span class="gemarra-regular">its arrangement, as it is stated: “To </span><span class="gemarra-regular">put out hot bread on the day it was taken </span><span class="gemarra-regular">away” </span>(I Samuel 21:7).
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And were there no more </span>miracles in the Temple? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Levi say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> matter is a tradition </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>received <span class="gemarra-regular">from our ancestors</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: The place of the Ark </span>of the Covenant <span class="gemarra-regular">is not</span> included <span class="gemarra-regular">in the measurement </span>of the Holy of Holies. Based on that measurement, the Ark should not have fit inside the hall. The Holy of Holies measured twenty cubits by twenty cubits (see I Kings 6), and a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states that there were ten cubits of space on either side of the Ark. Therefore, it was only through a miracle that the Ark fit in the Holy of Holies. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbenai said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">through a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">miracle </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">cherubs </span>that Solomon placed in the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">would stand. </span>Their wingspan was twenty cubits, and since the length of the chamber was the same, there was no room for the bodies of the cherubs. There were additional miracles performed in the Temple. 
The Gemara responds: The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">counts miracles that </span>were performed <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>the Sanctuary and were visible to all, but he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not count miracles</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>were performed <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the Sanctuary and were not visible to all. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, the shewbread is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also a miracle </span>performed on the table <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the Sanctuary and is not visible to all, yet the miracle that the bread’s heat did not dissipate was listed among the miracles. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The shewbread was a miracle</span> performed <span class="gemarra-regular">outside, as Reish Lakish said: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: </span>“Place them <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pure tabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> before the Lord in two rows, six to a row” (Leviticus 24:6)? From the emphasis that the Torah places on the fact that the table was ritually <span class="gemarra-regular">pure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it can be learned <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that it indicates that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>could become <span class="gemarra-regular">impure </span>as well. 

Daf 21b

The Gemara asks: How is that possible? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is a wooden vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> designated to res</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in a fixed place and not to be moved. And it was taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any wooden vessel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">designated to rest </span>in a fixed place <span class="gemarra-regular">is not susceptible </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to ritual impurity, and it serves as a barrier before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">impurity, </span>preventing its transmission. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the fact that the table is described as pure <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">lift i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in order to display the shewbread <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Festival pilgrims</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and they say to them: See how beloved you are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before the Omnipresent, as </span>the bread is as hot at <span class="gemarra-regular">its removal </span>on Shabbat, after a week on the table, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it was at <span class="gemarra-regular">its arrangement, as it is stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “To put out hot bread on the day it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taken away” </span>(I Samuel 21:7). Since the table was moved on occasion, it was not considered a wooden vessel designated to rest and was therefore susceptible to impurity. At the same time, it is clear that the miracle of the shewbread was a miracle performed outside the Sanctuary, as it was visible to all.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And are there no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> more </span>miracles performed in the Temple? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Oshaya say: When Solomon built the Temple he planted all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sorts of precious golden fruit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there, and </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">brought </span><span class="gemarra-regular">forth their fruit in their </span>appointed <span class="gemarra-regular">season </span>like other trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">and when the wind blew them </span>the fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">would fall, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “May his fruits rustle like Lebanon” </span>(Psalms 72:16). This indicates that fruits grew in Lebanon, which the Sages interpreted as a reference to the Temple, which was built with cedar trees from Lebanon. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentiles entered the Sanctuary </span>the golden tree <span class="gemarra-regular">withered, as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: “And the blossoms of Lebanon wither” </span>(Nahum 1:4). <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Holy One, Blessed be He, will restore the </span>miraculous trees to Israel <span class="gemarra-regular">in the future, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: “It shall blossom abundantly, it shall also rejoice and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shout, the glory of Lebanon will be given to it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Isaiah 35:2). Apparently, there were additional miracles in the Temple. 
The Gemara responds: The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">does not count perpetual miracles </span>on the list. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now that you have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">arrived at this </span>solution, it can resolve an earlier difficulty as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Ark and the cherubs </span>are also not counted, since <span class="gemarra-regular">they too were perpetual miracles. </span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in listing the miracles that even strong winds were unable to displace <span class="gemarra-regular">the smoke </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the arrangement of wood. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> smoke </span>rise from <span class="gemarra-regular">the arrangement of wood </span>on the altar? <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: There were <span class="gemarra-regular">five matters stated with regard to the fire of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> arrangement of wood: It crouched </span>above the wood <span class="gemarra-regular">like a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lion</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and it was </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">clear </span>as the light of the <span class="gemarra-regular">sun; and it had substance </span>to the extent that it could be felt; it was powerful enough <span class="gemarra-regular">to consume wet </span>wood <span class="gemarra-regular">like dry </span>wood; <span class="gemarra-regular">and it did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not raise smoke. </span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When we said </span>that the smoke was not displaced, indicating that the wood produced smoke, that was in reference to the fire brought by a <span class="gemarra-regular">person, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the altar” </span>(Leviticus 1:7), indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">even though fire </span><span class="gemarra-regular">descends from the heavens, </span>still there is a special <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to bring fire by a person</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The fire that the priests brought produced smoke, and the miracle related to that smoke. 
The Gemara asks: And was the altar’s fire <span class="gemarra-regular">crouched like a lion</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanina, the deputy </span>High <span class="gemarra-regular">Priest, said: I saw </span>the fire in the Temple and it was <span class="gemarra-regular">crouched like a dog </span>and not a lion? The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. Here, </span>where the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> stated that the fire resembled a lion, it refers to the fire in the <span class="gemarra-regular">First </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Temple; there, </span>where Rabbi Ḥanina, the deputy High Priest, said that the fire resembled a dog, it refers to the fire in the <span class="gemarra-regular">Second Temple. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And was there </span>fire that descended from the heavens <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Second Temple? Didn’t Rav Shmuel bar Inya say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written </span>with regard to the Second Temple: “Go up to the hills and get wood and build the house; <span class="gemarra-regular">and I will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">look on it favorably and I will be glorified [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ve’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ekkaved</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>said the Lord” (Haggai 1:8)? Even though it is written <span class="it-text">ve’ekkaved</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">we read it </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ve’ikkavda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with an added letter <span class="it-text">heh</span>. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different</span> that the word is <span class="gemarra-regular">missing </span>the letter <span class="gemarra-italic">heh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? This </span>represents <span class="gemarra-regular">five, </span>the numerological value of <span class="it-text">heh</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">phenomena </span>that constituted the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">First Temple </span>and the <span class="gemarra-regular">Second Temple</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in that they were not in the Second Temple. <span class="gemarra-regular">And these are: The Ark </span>of the Covenant, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Ark cover </span>upon it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the cherubs </span>that were on the Ark cover; <span class="gemarra-regular">fire; and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Divine Presence; and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Divine Spirit; and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Urim</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">VeTummim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Apparently, there was no fire from heaven in the Second Temple. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, there was </span>fire from heaven in the Second Temple; however, <span class="gemarra-regular">it did not assist </span>in burning the offerings but was merely visible above the wood.
Apropos the fire on the altar, the Gemara cites a related <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there are six kinds </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of fire: There is </span>fire that <span class="gemarra-regular">consumes solids and does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not consume liquids; and there is </span>fire that <span class="gemarra-regular">consumes liquids </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and does not consume solids; and there is </span>fire that <span class="gemarra-regular">consumes solids and consumes liquids; and there is </span>fire that <span class="gemarra-regular">consumes wet </span>objects <span class="gemarra-regular">like dry </span>objects; <span class="gemarra-regular">and there is fire </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that repels </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">fire; and there is fire that consumes</span> other <span class="gemarra-regular">fire. </span>
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is fire that consumes solids and does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> consume liquids; that is our </span>standard fire that consumes dry items but does not dry liquids. <br>Fire that <span class="gemarra-regular">consumes liquids</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and does not consume solids </span>is the fever <span class="gemarra-regular">of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sick </span>that dehydrates the body but does not consume the flesh. <br>Fire that <span class="gemarra-regular">consumes solids and consumes liquids </span>is the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">of Elijah </span>the Prophet, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: </span>“And fire fell from the sky and consumed the offering and the wood and the stones and the earth, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it licked up the water that was in the trench” </span>(I Kings 18:38). <br>Fire that <span class="gemarra-regular">consumes wet </span>objects <span class="gemarra-regular">like dry</span> objects is the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">of the arrangement of wood. </span><br><span class="gemarra-regular">There is fire that repels </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">fire; </span>that is the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the angel <span class="gemarra-regular">Gabriel. </span>The book of Daniel relates that Gabriel was an angel of fire who descended to the fiery furnace, repelled the fire, and rescued Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, who had been cast inside. <br><span class="gemarra-regular">And there is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fire that consumes </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">fire; </span>that is the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Divine Presence, as the Master said </span>in another context: The Holy One, Blessed be He, <span class="gemarra-regular">extended His finger </span>between the angels, who are also made of fire, <span class="gemarra-regular">and burned </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them. </span>The fire of the Divine Presence consumed the fire of the angels. 
§ The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the smoke of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> arrangement, </span>is it so that <span class="gemarra-regular">even if all the winds</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the world come and blow it, they do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> move it from its place </span>and it rises directly heavenward? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avdimi say: At the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">conclusion of the final day of the festival </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone looks to the smoke of the arrangement of wood; </span>if the wind blew from the south and the smoke <span class="gemarra-regular">tends toward the north, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">poor were glad and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">homeowners were sad. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it was a sign <span class="gemarra-regular">that the year’s rains would be plentiful, </span>producing an abundant crop on the one hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>on the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">the fruit would rot </span>due to the humidity, rendering it impossible to store the abundant harvest. This forced the landowners to sell quickly at a lower price. And if a northern wind caused the smoke to <span class="gemarra-regular">tend toward the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> south, the poor were sad and the homeowners were glad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, because </span>it was an indication <span class="gemarra-regular">that the year’s rains</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would be sparse. </span>The yield would be low, and it would be easy <span class="gemarra-regular">to store the fruit </span>and sell it at a higher price. 
If a western wind caused the smoke to tend <span class="gemarra-regular">to the east, </span>that was an indication that there would be sufficient rainfall to ensure a substantial crop, and at the same time, it would be possible to store the fruit, and <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone was glad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If an eastern wind caused the smoke to tend <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the west </span>that was an indication that there would be a drought because eastern winds do not bring rain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> everyone was sad. </span>Apparently, wind causes the smoke rising from the arrangement of wood to move. The Gemara responds: The smoke <span class="gemarra-regular">comes and goes like a palm tree, </span>swaying in the wind, <span class="gemarra-regular">but it did not disperse. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>If a western wind caused the pillar of smoke to tend <span class="gemarra-regular">to the east everyone is glad; </span>if an eastern wind caused the smoke to tend <span class="gemarra-regular">to the west</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> everyone was sad. And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raised a contradiction, </span>as the Sages said: <span class="gemarra-regular">An eastern </span>wind <span class="gemarra-regular">is always good; a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> western </span>wind <span class="gemarra-regular">is always bad; a northern </span>wind <span class="gemarra-regular">is good</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for wheat when </span>it has <span class="gemarra-regular">reached one-third </span>of its potential growth, <span class="gemarra-regular">and bad for olives when they are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ripening; a southern </span>wind <span class="gemarra-regular">is bad for wheat when </span>it has <span class="gemarra-regular">reached one-third </span>of its potential growth, <span class="gemarra-regular">and good</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for olives when they are ripening. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yosef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said, and some say it was Mar Zutra </span>who said it: <span class="gemarra-regular">And your mnemonic </span>for which is good for wheat and which for olives is that in the Temple the <span class="gemarra-regular">table was in the north and the candelabrum was in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the south </span>of the Sanctuary. Bread made out of wheat was placed on the table, and oil made out of olives was burned in the candelabrum. The wind coming from <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>side, the north, <span class="gemarra-regular">increased its own </span>component, wheat; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the wind coming from <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>side, the south, <span class="gemarra-regular">increased </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its own </span>component, olives. In any event, there are contradictory opinions with regard to the effect of western and eastern winds. 
The Gemara responds: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: This </span>opinion that a wind from the east is good <span class="gemarra-regular">is for us, </span>in Babylonia. Babylonia is a land whose water is plentiful, and a dry east wind will not harm the crop at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>opinion that a wind from the east is harmful <span class="gemarra-regular">is for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them, </span>in Eretz Yisrael. That is a land where water is sparse, and the dry east wind will dry the land and ruin the crops. 


Daf 22a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Initially</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the practice among the priests was that <span class="gemarra-regular">whoever wishes to remove </span>the ashes from <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">alta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">removes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them. And when there are many </span>priests who wish to perform that task, the privilege to do so is determined by a race: The priests <span class="gemarra-regular">run and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ascen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the ramp </span>leading to the top of the altar. <span class="gemarra-regular">Any </span>priest <span class="gemarra-regular">who precedes another </span>and reaches within <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>of the top of the altar first <span class="gemarra-regular">is privileged </span>to remove the ashes. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if both of them were equal </span>and neither preceded the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">the appointed </span>priest says to all the priests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Extend </span>your <span class="gemarra-regular">fingers, </span>and a lottery was performed, as will be explained.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>fingers <span class="gemarra-regular">do they extend </span>for the lottery? They may extend <span class="gemarra-regular">one or two </span>fingers, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">do not extend</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a thumb in the Temple. </span>The reason is that the lottery was conducted by the appointee choosing a number and counting the extended fingers of the priests standing in a circle. As the count progressed, a priest could calculate and manipulate the result in his favor by surreptitiously extending his thumb and an additional finger. Since there is separation between the thumb and the forefinger it could appear as though they belonged to two different priests, skewing the results of the lottery.
Initially, that was the procedure; however, <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident </span>occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">where both of them were equal </span>as they were <span class="gemarra-regular">running </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and ascending on the ramp, and one of them shoved </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another and he fell and his leg was broken. And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">once the court saw that </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">were coming to </span>potential <span class="gemarra-regular">danger, they instituted that </span>priests <span class="gemarra-regular">would remove </span>ashes from <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> altar only </span>by means <span class="gemarra-regular">of a lottery. There were four</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lotterie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there, </span>in the Temple, on a daily basis to determine the priests privileged to perform the various services, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this, </span>determining which priest would remove the ashes, was <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lottery</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara questions the original practice of holding a race to determine which priest would remove the ashes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reason that the Sages did not initially institute a lottery</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>the removal of the ashes as they did for other parts of the service? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Initially </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">thought: </span>Since it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a service </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">at night it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would not be important to </span>the priests, and <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>many of them would <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>to perform it, so a lottery would be unnecessary. Then, <span class="gemarra-regular">when they saw that </span>many priests <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">come and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they were coming to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">danger </span>by racing up the altar’s ramp, <span class="gemarra-regular">they instituted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a lottery.</span>
The Gemara poses a question against the assertion that nighttime Temple services did not normally require a lottery: <span class="gemarra-regular">But there is </span>the burning of the <span class="gemarra-regular">limbs </span>of burnt-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">and the fats </span>of other offerings, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">service </span>that is performed at <span class="gemarra-regular">night, and </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">instituted a lottery </span>for that from the outset. The Gemara answers: The burning of those parts is not considered a nighttime service but <span class="gemarra-regular">the end of a daytime service, </span>as the main part of the sacrificial service, the slaughtering and the sprinkling of blood, took place during the day. 
The Gemara asks: If so, it could be argued that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>service of removing the ashes is <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>not a nighttime service but <span class="gemarra-regular">the start of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a daytime service, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>If a priest has <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctified his hands </span>at night by washing them <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the removal of the ashes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the next day, </span>i.e., after daybreak, if he remained in the confines of the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">he need not sanctify </span>his hands again, <span class="gemarra-regular">because he already sanctified </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">at the start of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the service. </span>Apparently, the removal of the ashes, though performed at night, is considered the start of the next day’s service.
The Gemara responds by emending Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>the following version of the end of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because he had already sanctified </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the outset for service. </span>According to this formulation, Rabbi Yoḥanan did not say that the removal of the ashes is considered the start of the following day’s service. Rather, he said that although the removal of the ashes is a nighttime service, since the priest sanctified his hands before performing that service, the sanctification remains in effect for the services performed after daybreak as well, since there is no interruption between the two activities.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>that the original practice should be explained as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Initially, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">thought </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>a likelihood of being <span class="gemarra-regular">overcome by sleep </span>at that time of night, <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>many priests <span class="gemarra-regular">would come. When </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they saw that they did </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">come and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were also coming to danger, the Sages instituted a lottery </span>for this task. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But there is </span>the burning of the <span class="gemarra-regular">limbs </span>of burnt-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">and the fats</span> of other offerings, a service for <span class="gemarra-regular">which there is </span>the same likelihood of being <span class="gemarra-regular">overcome by sleep, </span>and nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sages instituted a lottery </span>for that from the outset. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lying down </span>to go to sleep late <span class="gemarra-regular">is different from rising </span>in the middle of the night. It is not as difficult to stay up late in order to burn limbs on the altar as it is to rise before dawn to remove the ashes from the altar.
The Gemara addresses the substance of the mishna’s claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">But was the ordinance </span>to assign the removal of ashes by means of a lottery <span class="gemarra-regular">due to that reaso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> cited in the mishna, the matter of the dangerous incident? <span class="gemarra-regular">The ordinance </span>was instituted <span class="gemarra-regular">due</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to this reason: </span>There were other important tasks associated with the removal of the ashes that required a lottery in their own right, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The priest <span class="gemarra-regular">who was privileged to </span>perform <span class="gemarra-regular">the removal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the ashe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">privileged with laying out the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> arrangement of wood </span>on the altar and with placing <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two logs </span>that were placed on the altar each morning. Since these were inherently important tasks, the only way to assign them was through a lottery, which would also determine who removed the ashes.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: There were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">ordinances </span>instituted. <span class="gemarra-regular">Initially, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">thought </span>that priests <span class="gemarra-regular">would not </span>come forward to perform the task of removing the ashes. <span class="gemarra-regular">Once they saw that </span>many priests <span class="gemarra-regular">did come </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they were also coming to danger, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted a lottery </span>for this task. <span class="gemarra-regular">Once they established a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lottery </span>for removing the ashes, the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">did not come </span>anymore. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said: Who says </span>the lottery <span class="gemarra-regular">will fall in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> our favor? </span>Therefore, they did not bother to come. <span class="gemarra-regular">Then </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">instituted for </span>the priests that <span class="gemarra-regular">whoever was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">privileged with </span>performing <span class="gemarra-regular">the removal of the ashes would </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">be privileged with laying out the arrangement of wood </span>on the altar and with placing the <span class="gemarra-regular">two logs, so that </span>the importance of all these tasks combined would ensure that the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">would come and participate in the lottery.</span>
§ It was taught in the mishna that before the lottery was instituted, <span class="gemarra-regular">when there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were many </span>priests who sought to perform the removal of the ashes, the first priest to reach within four cubits of the top of the altar was privileged with performing the removal of the ashes. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious to me </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>the mishna is referring to are not the four cubits adjacent to the ramp <span class="gemarra-regular">on the ground, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the mishna that the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">run and ascend on the ramp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and not adjacent to the ramp. It is <span class="gemarra-regular">also not </span>referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>four cubits from the foot of the ramp, because <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>that the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">run and ascend on the ramp, and only afterward </span>it says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any </span>priest <span class="gemarra-regular">who precedes anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> and reaches within four cubits of the altar first, indicating that the competition begins only once they have ascended the ramp to some extent.
It is <span class="gemarra-regular">also not </span>referring to four cubits somewhere in the <span class="gemarra-regular">middle, </span>between the four on the bottom and the top of the altar, because <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> defined </span>and there is no clear indication which four cubits on the ramp are the determining cubits. In light of all this, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious to me </span>that the four cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the mishna are referring to the four cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">that are adjacent to the altar </span>itself. The priest who reaches those four cubits first is the one privileged to remove the ashes.
Rav Pappa <span class="gemarra-regular">raised a dilemma </span>based on the above clarification: Are the <span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits that they stated, </span>which are the four cubits adjacent to the altar, calculated <span class="gemarra-regular">including the cubit of the base </span>of the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the cubit of </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">ledge, </span>as the ramp continues and overlaps these two cubits at the top of the altar, 

Daf 22b

<span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>are they <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps calculated excluding the cubit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the base </span>of the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">and the cubit of</span> its <span class="gemarra-regular">ledge? </span>The altar’s edge can be considered to be at the end of the ramp, the point at which it meets the altar, or it can be considered the point on the ramp that is directly over the external base of the altar, which is two cubits away from the point where the ramp meets the altar. Which of these two calculations is the correct one? Rav Pappa’s question remains unanswered, and the Gemara concludes: The dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved.
§ It was taught in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">if both of them were equal </span>and neither preceded the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">the appointed </span>priest <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>to all the priests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Extend </span>your <span class="gemarra-regular">fingers </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">hatzbiu</span>], and a lottery was performed. A <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the meaning of the unusual term <span class="it-text">hatzbiu</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Put out your fingers for a count. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him count </span>the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">themselves </span>directly, rather than counting their fingers. The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">support for </span>a teaching of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: It is prohibited to count Jew</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> directly, <span class="gemarra-regular">even for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the purposes of a mitzva, as it is written </span>concerning King Saul and his count of his soldiers: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he numbered them with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bezek</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span>(I Samuel 11:8),meaning that he counted them through shards, one shard representing each man, rather than counting them directly.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ashi strongly objects to this </span>interpretation of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where </span>do you derive <span class="gemarra-regular">that this </span>word <span class="gemarra-italic">bezek</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> term </span>related to the verb meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">to break apart, </span>so that it means shards? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps it is the name</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a town, </span>and it means that Saul counted them in Bezek, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “And they found </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Adoni-bezek </span>in Bezek” (Judges 1:5), which shows that Bezek is the name of a place. The Gemara answers: Indeed, the proof is not from that verse <span class="gemarra-regular">but from here, </span>where it says: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Saul summoned the people and numbered</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them by sheep” </span>(I Samuel 15:4), meaning that Saul tallied his soldiers by having each one take a sheep and put it aside to represent him in the count.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Whoever counts </span>a group of <span class="gemarra-regular">Jews violates a negative </span>mitzva, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And the number of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> children of Israel will be like the sand of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sea, which cannot be measured” </span>(Hosea 2:1). Rabbi Elazar interprets the verse to be saying: Which may not be measured. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>One who counts a group of Jews in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">violates two negative </span>mitzvot, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is stated </span>in that verse: “Which <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot be measured</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and cannot be counted” </span>(Hosea 2:1).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel bar Naḥmani said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan raised a contradiction: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">It is written </span>in this verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the number of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the children of Israel will be like the sand of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the sea,” </span>suggesting that they will have a specific number, though it will be very large. On the other hand, it continues and says: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Which cannot be measured and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cannot be counted,” </span>which means they will not be countable at all. How can these two statements be reconciled? 
It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: Here, </span>in the second statement, it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a time when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Jewish people fulfill the will of God; </span>then they will be innumerable. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the first statement, it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a time when </span>the Jewish people <span class="gemarra-regular">do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fulfill the will of God; </span>then they will be like the sand of the sea, having a specific number. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span> Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>a different resolution <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abba Yosei ben Dostai: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: Here, </span>in the second statement, it is referring to counting <span class="gemarra-regular">by the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hand of man; </span>the Jewish people will be too numerous to count by man. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the first statement, it is referring to counting <span class="gemarra-regular">by the hand of God, </span>and He will find that they are like the number of the grains of the sand of the sea. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Nehilai bar Idi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: Once a man</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is appointed as a leader of the community, he becomes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wealthy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This is derived from the verses cited above. <span class="gemarra-regular">Initially, it is written </span>with regard to Saul: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he numbered them with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bezek</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>meaning pottery shards, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the end it is written: “And he numbered them with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sheep,” </span>indicating that he was able to provide enough of his own sheep to use them in counting the people. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps </span>the people provided these sheep <span class="gemarra-regular">from their own </span>flocks. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so, what is the novelty in the matter? </span>Why would the text tell us that the people were counted with sheep if not to illustrate incidentally the great wealth of Saul?
§ Having mentioned the verse about Saul, the Gemara proceeds to interpret more of that passage: “And Saul came to the city of Amalek <span class="gemarra-regular">and he strove in the valley” </span>(I Samuel 15:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Mani said: </span>This means that Saul strove with God, as it were, <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning the matter of the valley</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. At the time when the Holy One, Blessed be He</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, said to </span>Saul: “Now <span class="gemarra-regular">go and attack Amalek </span>and proscribe all that belongs to him; do not pity him, but kill men and women alike, infants and sucklings alike, oxen and sheep alike, camel and donkey alike” (I Samuel 15:3), Saul countered and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Now, if </span>on account of <span class="gemarra-regular">one life </span>that is taken, in a case where a slain person’s body is found and the murderer is unknown, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah said to bring a heifer whose neck </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is broken </span>to a barren valley, in the atonement ritual described in Deuteronomy 6:1–9, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>must I have pity and not take <span class="gemarra-regular">all these </span>Amalekite <span class="gemarra-regular">lives</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> he further reasoned: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the men have sinned, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span> way <span class="gemarra-regular">have the animals sinned? </span>Why, then, should the Amalekites’ livestock be destroyed? <span class="gemarra-regular">And if the adults have sinned, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">have the children sinned? A Divine Voice </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">came forth and said to him: “Do not be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">overly righteous” </span>(Ecclesiastes 7:16). That is to say: Do not be more merciful than the Creator Himself, Who has commanded you to do this, for to do so would not be an indication of righteousness but of weakness. At a later time, <span class="gemarra-regular">when Saul said to Doeg: “Turn around and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> strike down the priests, </span>and Doeg the Edomite turned around and struck down the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod, and he struck Nob the city of priests by the sword, man and woman alike, infants and sucklings alike, oxen and donkeys and sheep, by the sword” (I Samuel 22:18–19), <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Divine Voice came forth and said to him: “Do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be overly wicked” </span>(Ecclesiastes 7:17).
Apropos Saul’s contravention of God’s command to obliterate Amalek, the Gemara observes that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Huna said: How little does a person who has the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">support of his Lord have to worry or be concerned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The proof for this assertion is a comparison between Saul and David. <span class="gemarra-regular">Saul </span>failed <span class="gemarra-regular">with one </span>single sin <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was counted against him, </span>costing him the throne. <span class="gemarra-regular">David</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>however, failed <span class="gemarra-regular">with two </span>sins <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they were <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">counted against him, </span>as he retained his position. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What was Saul’s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>sin? <span class="gemarra-regular">The incident </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">Agag, </span>king of Amalek, whom Saul spared in defiance of God’s command (see I Samuel 15:9). <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>was this his sole sin? <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">the incident of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Nob, the city of priests, </span>in which Saul later slew many innocent people, as cited above. The Gemara answers: It was after <span class="gemarra-regular">the incident </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">Agag, </span>and even before the incident at Nob, that God said: <span class="gemarra-regular">“I regret that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I have crowned Saul to be king” </span>(I Samuel 15:11).
Rav Huna stated above that <span class="gemarra-regular">David </span>failed <span class="gemarra-regular">with two </span>sins. <span class="gemarra-regular">What were they? </span>One was the incident in which he had <span class="gemarra-regular">Uriah </span>killed. The other was the matter of <span class="gemarra-regular">the incitement </span>of David to conduct a census of the Jewish people (see II Samuel 24:1), which led to many deaths in a plague. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>were these his only two sins? <span class="gemarra-regular">There is also</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the incident of Bathsheba, </span>in which he took another man’s wife as his own. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">punishment was exacted from him </span>separately, so the matter is no longer listed among his sins, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written </span>with regard to this incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall restore the lamb fourfold” </span>(II Samuel 12:6). The lamb was a metaphor for Bathsheba, and ultimately David was indeed given a fourfold punishment for taking Bathsheba: The first <span class="gemarra-regular">child</span> born to Bathsheba and David died (see II Samuel 12:13–23); David’s son <span class="gemarra-regular">Amnon </span>was killed; <span class="gemarra-regular">Tamar, </span>his daughter, was raped by Amnon (see II Samuel 13); <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>his son <span class="gemarra-regular">Avshalom </span>rebelled against him and was ultimately killed (see II Samuel 15–18).
The Gemara asks: If sins for which was David was punished separately are not counted, one could ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, too, </span>with regard to the sin of the census, <span class="gemarra-regular">he was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">punished </span>separately, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “And the Lord sent </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a plague against Israel from the morning until the appointed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">time” </span>(II Samuel 24:15). The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>David <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not punished </span>personally, <span class="gemarra-regular">in his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">body; </span>rather, the punishment was inflicted on the Jewish people. 
The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, too, </span>in the incident with Bathsheba, David <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not punished </span>personally, <span class="gemarra-regular">in his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">body; </span>rather, it was his children who suffered punishment. The Gemara answers: That is <span class="gemarra-regular">not so; he was punished </span>personally, <span class="gemarra-regular">in his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">body</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>for that sin, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: David was stricken with leprosy </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">six months </span>after that incident, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Sanhedrin withdrew from him </span>in protest over his behavior, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Divine Presence </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">left him. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written </span>that David prayed: <span class="gemarra-regular">“May those who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fear You return to me, and they who know Your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> testimonies” </span>(Psalms 119:79). Since he prayed for the return of those who fear God and who know His testimonies, referring to the Sages of the Sanhedrin, it can be inferred that they had withdrawn from him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Restore to me the joy of Your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> salvation, </span>let a vigorous spirit support me” (Psalms 51:14), where David asks for the return of the Divine Spirit, which had left him.
The Gemara asks: And didn’t David commit other sins? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav say: David accepted a slanderous report </span>from Ziba about Mephibosheth, son of Jonathan, stating that the latter was pleased with David’s downfall? There was, in that case, this additional sin. The Gemara responds: Consequently, it is necessary to follow the approach of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, who said: David did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accept a slanderous report, </span>because Ziba’s claim was true. 
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And even</span> according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav, who said that David accepted a slanderous</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> report, </span>one could answer that that sin is not counted, as <span class="gemarra-regular">was he not punished </span>for it? <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: At the time when David said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Mephibosheth: “I say that you and Ziba should divide</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the field” </span>(II Samuel 19:30), <span class="gemarra-regular">a Divine Voice came </span><span class="gemarra-regular">forth and said to him: Rehoboam and Jeroboam will divide </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the kingship. </span>Because David believed Ziba’s slanderous report and awarded him half of Mephibosheth’s field, David was punished by having his kingdom divided into two. Following King Solomon’s death the Jewish people split into two kingdoms, Israel to the north and Judea to the south (see I Kings 12<span class="gemarra-regular">)</span>. Therefore, David was punished for that sin too.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of Saul and David. It is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Saul was one year old when he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">began to reign” </span>(I Samuel 13:1), which cannot be understood literally, as Saul was appointed king when he was a young man. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: </span>The verse means that when he began to reign he was <span class="gemarra-regular">like a one-year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">–old, in that he had never tasted the taste of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sin </span>but was wholly innocent and upright. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak strongly objects to this </span>interpretation of the verse, saying: You could just as well <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that he was <span class="gemarra-regular">like a one-year-old </span>in that he was always <span class="gemarra-regular">filthy with mud and excrement</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥman was shown a frightful dream </span>that night, and he understood it as a punishment for having disparaged Saul. <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: I humbly submit myself to you, O bones of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Saul, son of Kish, </span>and beg your forgiveness. But <span class="gemarra-regular">once </span><span class="gemarra-regular">again he was shown a frightful dream, </span>and he understood that he had not shown enough deference in his first apology. He therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>this time: <span class="gemarra-regular">I humbly submit myself</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to you, O bones of Saul, son of Kish, king</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Israel, </span>and beg your forgiveness. Subsequently, the nightmares ceased.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: Why did the kingship of the house </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Saul not continue </span>on to succeeding generations? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because there was no flaw </span>in his ancestry; he was of impeccable lineage. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak: One appoints a leader over </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the community only if he has a box </span>full <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">creeping animals hanging behind him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he has something inappropriate in his ancestry that preceded him. Why is that? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">so that if he exhibits a haughty </span><span class="gemarra-regular">attitude toward the community, one can say to him: Turn </span>and look <span class="gemarra-regular">behind you </span>and be reminded of your humble roots. This is why David’s kingdom lasted while Saul’s did not, as David descended from a family with problematic ancestry, namely Tamar (see Genesis, chapter 38) and Ruth the Moabite (see Ruth 4:18–22).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: Why was Saul punished </span>in that he was ultimately led to commit the sins described above? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because </span>at the very outset of his reign he inappropriately <span class="gemarra-regular">forwent </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>royal <span class="gemarra-regular">honor, as it is stated </span>with regard to Saul’s inauguration: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And some base fellows said: How can</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this man save us? So they disparaged him and brought</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him no present. But he made himself as if he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not hear” </span>(I Samuel 10:27). And it is stated immediately afterward: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Nahash the Ammonite marched up and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> encamped against Jabesh-gilead” </span>(I Samuel 11:1). The implication is that if Saul had forcefully assumed his throne, Nahash would not have dared to attack the people of Jabesh-gilead. In this way, his humility led to the crisis. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Any Torah scholar</span>

Daf 23a

<span class="gemarra-regular">who does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> avenge </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">and bear a grudge like a snak</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> when insulted <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a Torah scholar </span>at all, as it is important to uphold the honor of Torah and its students by reacting harshly to insults. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it written </span>explicitly in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall not take vengeance nor bear any grudge </span>against the children of your people” (Leviticus 19:18)? The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">is written with regard to monetary </span>matters and not personal insults, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is revenge and what is bearing a grudge? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Reveng</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> is illustrated by the following example: <span class="gemarra-regular">One said to</span> his fellow: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lend me your sickle, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: No</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. The next day he, </span>the one who had refused to lend the sickle, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the other person: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lend </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me your ax. </span>If he <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not lend to you, just as you did not lend </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to me, that is revenge.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And what is bearing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a grudge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> If <span class="gemarra-regular">one said to </span>his fellow: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lend </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me your ax, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: No, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the next </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day he, </span>the one who had refused to lend the ax, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the other man: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lend me your robe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>if the first one <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Here it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">I am not like you, who would not lend</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to me, that is bearing a grudge. </span>Although he does not respond to his friend’s inconsiderate behavior in kind, he still makes it known to his friend that he resents his inconsiderate behavior. This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> shows that the prohibition relates only to monetary matters, such as borrowing and lending. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>does the prohibition against vengeance really <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>relate also to matters of <span class="gemarra-regular">personal anguish </span>suffered by someone? <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Those who are insulted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but do not insult </span>others, <span class="gemarra-regular">who hear themselves </span>being <span class="gemarra-regular">shame</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but do not respond, who act out of love</span> for God, <span class="gemarra-regular">and who </span>remain <span class="gemarra-regular">happy in </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">suffering, about</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them the verse states: “They that love Him be as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the sun when it goes forth in its might” </span>(Judges 5:31). This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> shows that one should forgive personal insults as well as wrongs in monetary matters.
The Gemara responds that the prohibition against taking vengeance and bearing a grudge indeed applies to cases of personal anguish; however, <span class="gemarra-regular">actually, </span>the scholar may <span class="gemarra-regular">keep </span>resentment <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his heart</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> though he should not act on it or remind the other person of his insulting behavior. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rava say: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">whoever forgoes his reckonings </span>with others for injustices done to him, the heavenly court in turn <span class="gemarra-regular">forgoes </span>punishment <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all his sins? </span>The Gemara answers: Indeed, even a scholar who is insulted must forgive insults, but that is only in cases where his antagonist <span class="gemarra-regular">has sought to appease </span>him, in which case he should allow himself to <span class="gemarra-regular">be appeased </span>toward him. However, if no apology has been offered, the scholar should not forgive him, in order to uphold the honor of the Torah.
§ The mishna describes that the lottery between competing priests is conducted by the priests extending their fingers for a count. And the mishna elaborated: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>fingers <span class="gemarra-regular">do they extend </span>for the lottery? They may extend <span class="gemarra-regular">one or two </span>fingers, and the priests do not extend a thumb in the Temple. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>that the mishna states that the priest may extend <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>fingers, is it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state that they may also extend <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>finger? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here, </span>when the mishna speaks of extending one finger, it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a healthy person</span>, who has no difficulty extending just one finger without extending a second one. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>when the mishna mentions two fingers, it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a sick person, </span>for whom it is difficult to extend a single finger at a time. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">They </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">extend one </span>finger, but <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not extend two. In </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">a healthy person; however, a sick person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">extend even two </span>fingers. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the sick priests who sit or lie <span class="gemarra-regular">alone, </span>separately from the other priests, <span class="gemarra-regular">extend two</span> fingers, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>their two fingers are <span class="gemarra-regular">counted only as one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>are the sick priest’s two fingers really <span class="gemarra-regular">counted as only one?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The priests may <span class="gemarra-regular">not extend the third </span>finger, i.e., the middle finger, <span class="gemarra-regular">or the thumb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> together with the index finger, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>concern for <span class="gemarra-regular">cheaters. </span>One who sees that the count is approaching him might intentionally extend or withdraw an extra finger so that the lottery will fall on him. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he does extend the third </span>finger <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> counted for him. </span>This is because the third finger cannot be stretched very far from the index finger, so that it is easily recognizable that both fingers are from the same person, and this is not taken as an attempt to cheat. If he extends his <span class="gemarra-regular">thumb, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not counted for him, and moreover </span>he is punished with <span class="gemarra-regular">lashes </span>administered by <span class="gemarra-regular">the person in charge of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pakia</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The implication of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is that when the third finger is extended along with the index finger, both fingers are counted. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mean when it says that if the priest extended his middle finger along with his index finger, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is counted for him? </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>means, as stated earlier, that the two fingers are counted as <span class="gemarra-regular">one.</span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mentions lashes administered by the person in charge of the <span class="it-text">pakia</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pakia</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rav said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">madra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>However, the meaning of that term also became unclear over time, so the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">madra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rav Pappa </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: It is a whip [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">matraka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> used by <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Arabs, the end of which is split </span>into several strands. That is the <span class="it-text">pakia</span> mentioned above, which was used for punishing the priests. 
Apropos this discussion, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: At first </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I would say </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">When we learned </span>in a mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Beivai was in charge of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pakia</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I would say </span>that it means that he was in charge of producing <span class="gemarra-regular">wicks, as we learned </span>in another mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">They would tear </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">mafkia</span>] strips <span class="gemarra-regular">from the priests’ worn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-out trousers and belt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>make wicks out of them, <span class="gemarra-regular">with which they lit </span>the lamps for the Celebration of Drawing Water. But <span class="gemarra-regular">once I heard that which is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in the previously cited <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And moreover, </span>he is punished with <span class="gemarra-regular">lashes </span>administered by <span class="gemarra-regular">the person in charge of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pakia</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, I </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">say: What </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pakia</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">lashes. </span>Ben Beivai was in charge of corporal punishment in the Temple.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">An incident </span>occurred where <span class="gemarra-regular">both of </span>the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">were equal </span>as they were <span class="gemarra-regular">running and ascending on the ramp, </span>and one of them shoved the other and he fell and his leg was broken. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">An incident </span>occurred where there were <span class="gemarra-regular">two priests who were equal </span>as they were <span class="gemarra-regular">running and ascending the ramp. One of them </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reached the four cubits before his colleague, </span>who then, out of anger, <span class="gemarra-regular">took a knife and stabbed him in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> heart. </span>
The <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tzado</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">stood up on the steps of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Entrance Hall </span>of the Sanctuary <span class="gemarra-regular">and said: Hear </span>this, <span class="gemarra-regular">my brothers of the house of Israel. </span>The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">If one be found slain in the land... </span>and it be not known who had smitten him; <span class="gemarra-regular">then your Elders </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and your judges shall come forth </span>and they shall measure…and it shall be that the city which is nearest to the slain man…shall take a heifer” (Deuteronomy 21:1–3). And the Elders of that city took that heifer and broke its neck in a ritual of atonement. But what of <span class="gemarra-regular">us, </span>in our situation? <span class="gemarra-regular">Upon whom </span>is the obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">to bring the heifer whose neck is broken? </span>Does the obligation fall <span class="gemarra-regular">on the city, </span>Jerusalem, so that its Sages must bring the calf, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>does the obligation fall <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyards, </span>so that the priests must bring it? At that point <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire </span>assembly of <span class="gemarra-regular">people burst</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into tears.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The father of the boy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the young priest who was stabbed, <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and found that he was </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">convulsing. He said: May </span>my son’s death <span class="gemarra-regular">be an atonement for you. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">my son is still convulsin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> and has not yet died, and as such, <span class="gemarra-regular">the knife, </span>which is in his body, <span class="gemarra-regular">has not become ritually impure </span>through contact with a corpse. If you remove it promptly, it will still be pure for future use. The <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> comments: This incident comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to teach you that the ritual purity of utensils </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">of more concern to them than the shedding of blood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Even the boy’s father voiced more concern over the purity of the knife than over the death of his child. <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, it says: “Furthermore, Manasseh spilled innocent blood</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to another” </span>(II Kings 21:16), which shows that in his day as well people paid little attention to bloodshed.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Which incident came first, </span>the one about the broken leg reported in the mishna or the one about the slain priest in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that the incident of <span class="gemarra-regular">bloodshed </span>came first, this raises a problem: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, </span>if in response to a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">bloodshed they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not establish a lottery </span>but continued with the running competition, can it be that in response to an incident of a priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">leg being broken they did establish </span>a lottery? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>we must say that the case in which the priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">leg was broken </span>in the course of the race <span class="gemarra-regular">came first, </span>and as the mishna states, the establishment of the lottery was in response to that incident. 
The Gemara asks: If the running competition was abolished immediately after the incident of the broken leg and a lottery was instituted to replace it, <span class="gemarra-regular">once they established</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the lottery, what were they doing </span>still running to within <span class="gemarra-regular">the four cubits </span>in the incident that led to the priest’s murder? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, actually, </span>it is necessary to return to the approach suggested earlier, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the case involving <span class="gemarra-regular">bloodshed came first. Initially, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">thought that it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">merely a random, </span>i.e., isolated, <span class="gemarra-regular">event</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and because it was extremely unlikely for a murder to happen again they did not abolish the competition due to that incident. Then, <span class="gemarra-regular">once they saw that in any event </span>the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">were coming to danger, </span>as one of them was pushed and broke his leg, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages established a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lottery</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara returns to the incident of the slain priest and discusses several details of it. It was related that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tzadok stood up</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the steps of the Entrance Hall </span>of the Sanctuary <span class="gemarra-regular">and said: Hear </span>this, <span class="gemarra-regular">my brothers of the house </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Israel. </span>The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “If one be found slain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the land, </span>etc.” But what of <span class="gemarra-regular">us, </span>in our situation? <span class="gemarra-regular">Upon whom </span>is the obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">to bring </span>the heifer whose neck is broken? Does the obligation fall <span class="gemarra-regular">upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the city, </span>Jerusalem, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>does the obligation fall <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the</span> Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyards? </span>The Gemara asks: Is <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem subject to bringing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a heifer whose neck is broken? Wasn’t it taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ten things were said </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem </span>to distinguish it from all other cities in Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this is one of them: </span>

Daf 23b

Jerusalem <span class="gemarra-regular">does not bring </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a heifer whose neck is broken</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The reason for this is that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the heifer whose neck is broken applies only to land that was apportioned to a specific tribe of the Jewish people. Jerusalem alone was not divided among the tribes, but was shared equally by the entire nation. <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, it is written </span>that the heifer whose neck is broken is brought when <span class="gemarra-regular">“it be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not known who had smitten him,</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>here, in the case of the slain priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was </span>well <span class="gemarra-regular">known who had smitten him. Rather, </span>one must conclude that Rabbi Tzadok invoked the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the heifer whose neck is broken not because it actually applied in this case but only in <span class="gemarra-regular">order </span>to arouse the people’s grief and <span class="gemarra-regular">to increase weeping</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
In relating the above incident the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> said: <span class="gemarra-regular">The father of the boy came and found that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he was </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">convulsing. He said: May </span>my son’s death <span class="gemarra-regular">be an atonement for you. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">my son is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">still alive, </span>etc. This incident comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to teach you that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the ritual purity of utensils </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">of more concern to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them than the shedding of blood. A dilemma was raised</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before </span>the Sages: Should one conclude from this comment that <span class="gemarra-regular">bloodshed had become trivialized </span>in their eyes <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>their concern for <span class="gemarra-regular">purity of utensils remained where it was </span>originally, meaning that while they cared less than they should have about murder, they did not exaggerate the importance of purity of utensils; <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps </span>their concern for <span class="gemarra-regular">bloodshed remained where it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was </span>originally, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>their concern for <span class="gemarra-regular">purity of vessels </span>had become too <span class="gemarra-regular">strict, </span>to the extent that its importance was exaggerated beyond concern for human life? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>an answer to the dilemma: Since the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">adduces a biblical teaching </span>from the verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">“Furthermore, Manasseh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spilled innocent blood,” conclude from this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it was bloodshed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that had become trivialized</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the importance of <span class="gemarra-regular">purity</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of utensils remained where it had been.</span>
§ The Gemara returns to the mitzva of removing the ashes from the altar and associated issues. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The Torah states, after describing the removal of the ashes: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall put off </span>his garments, <span class="gemarra-regular">and put on other garments, and carry the ashes out </span>of the camp to a clean place” (Leviticus 6:4). <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>might <span class="gemarra-regular">understand </span>from here that this change of garments is a mitzva to change into a different kind of garment, <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>the change of garments performed on <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur,</span> when the High Priest changes back and forth from gold clothes to white clothes. Here, too, the Torah requires <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he remove his sacred garments and put on non-sacred</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> garments</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: To teach us otherwise, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And he shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> put off his garments, and put on other garments,” </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposing the garments he puts on to the garments he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> takes off. </span>This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as there, </span>the garments he removes, i.e., those in which he had performed the mitzva of removal of the ashes, are <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred garments</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, so too here, </span>the clothes he puts on to take the ashes out of the camp are <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred garments</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">If so, what </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: Other </span>garments, which implies that the second set of garments is different from the first? It means they are <span class="gemarra-regular">of lower quality than </span>the first set of garments. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says </span>a different interpretation of the words: Other garments. The verse states: “And put on <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>garments, <span class="gemarra-regular">and carry </span>the ashes <span class="gemarra-regular">out </span>of the camp,” in which the Hebrew juxtaposes the words “other” and “carry out.” This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that priests with </span>physical <span class="gemarra-regular">blemishes, </span>who are considered others in that they are not eligible to perform sacred tasks, <span class="gemarra-regular">are eligible to carry out the ashes. </span>
The Gemara now explains the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in detail. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The words: <span class="gemarra-regular">Other </span>garments, teach that they are to be <span class="gemarra-regular">of lower quality than </span>the garments worn during the removal of the ashes. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yishmael, as it was taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yishmael: Clothes </span>worn by a servant <span class="gemarra-regular">as he was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cooking food for his master </span>that became soiled in the process <span class="gemarra-regular">should not </span>be worn by him when <span class="gemarra-regular">he pours</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a cup for his master, </span>which is a task that calls for the servant to present a dignified appearance. Similarly, one who performs the dirtying task of carrying out the ashes should not wear the same fine clothes worn to perform other services.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> taught that Rabbi Eliezer derived from the word other that blemished priests are eligible for the task of carrying out the ashes, while the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> derived a different teaching from those words. The Gemara clarifies the scope of the dispute between the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> and Rabbi Eliezer. <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: Just</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a dispute </span>between Rabbi Eliezer and the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to carrying </span>the ashes <span class="gemarra-regular">out </span>of the camp, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, there is a dispute with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to the removal of the ashes </span>from the altar. Rabbi Eliezer maintains that the removal of the ashes may also be performed by blemished priests, while the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> disagrees. <span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>is only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to carrying </span>the ashes <span class="gemarra-regular">out </span>of the camp, <span class="gemarra-regular">but all agree that the removal </span>of the ashes <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span>bona fide Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service </span>that cannot be performed by blemished priests. 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the reason behind </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Reish Lakish? </span>Reish Lakish could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: If it enters your mind</span> that the removal of the ashes <span class="gemarra-regular">is a </span>bona fide Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service, </span>you are faced with the following difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you have </span>any Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service that may be performed with</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">two garments </span>rather than the full set of four vestments worn by the priests? In the Torah’s description of the garments worn to remove the ashes it says: “And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen trousers shall he put on his flesh” (Leviticus 6:3). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what is the explanation for <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan’s </span>opinion? In fact, the priest is required to wear all four priestly garments. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Merciful</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> One reveals </span>in the Torah that the priest must wear <span class="gemarra-regular">the tunic and the trousers </span>like any other service so that one would not think that taking out the ashes may be performed in regular, non-sacred clothes. Once the Torah has made this point and mentioned these two specific garments, <span class="gemarra-regular">the same is true </span>for the other two garments as well, i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">the mitre and the belt. </span>
The Gemara asks: If the Torah requires all four garments and mentions the tunic and trousers only as examples, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> different about these </span>two that the Torah mentioned them in particular? The Gemara answers that these two particular garments were mentioned in order to teach certain <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>. The Torah refers to the tunic as <span class="gemarra-regular">“his linen garment,” </span>with the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“his garment” [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">middo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>indicating that the tunic must conform <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>exact <span class="gemarra-regular">siz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">middato</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>and should fit the priest perfectly. As for the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“linen trousers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>they come to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">that which was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>as the priest gets dressed <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>garment <span class="gemarra-regular">should precede the trousers? As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated: “And his linen trousers shall he put </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on his flesh,” </span>which implies that the trousers should be donned when the priest has nothing but his flesh, i.e., when he has no other garments on him yet.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lakish, </span>who maintains that these two garments are mentioned because they are the only two that the priest wears when removing the ashes, from where does he derive these two <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>? The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>linen <span class="gemarra-regular">garment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the tunic, must be <span class="gemarra-regular">according to his size</span> is derived the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One uses the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> expression “his garment,” </span>i.e., his fitted garment, in the Torah, rather than calling it by its usual name, tunic. And the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that no </span>garment <span class="gemarra-regular">should precede the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">trousers </span>when the priest dresses is <span class="gemarra-regular">derived </span>from the fact that the Torah added the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“on his flesh.”</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish is <span class="gemarra-regular">parallel to</span> a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>As it was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the Torah states: “And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen trousers shall he put on his flesh” (Leviticus 6:3). The words “shall he put on” seem superfluous, since these same words were already stated earlier in the verse. Therefore, the Torah could have sufficed with saying: “And linen trousers <span class="gemarra-regular">on his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">flesh.” What </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">“Shall he put on”? </span>This extra expression comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">include </span>the donning of the <span class="gemarra-regular">mitre and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">belt, </span>which are not mentioned here explicitly, for <span class="gemarra-regular">the removal </span>of the ash; this is the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa says: </span>The extra expression comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to include the </span>permissibility of the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s clothes </span>that he wears <span class="gemarra-regular">on Yom Kippur, </span>which are linen garments identical to those of the common priest, to teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are acceptable </span>to be used afterward by <span class="gemarra-regular">common priests </span>in their service. In other words, the expression teaches that the High Priest’s garments need not be permanently retired from service after Yom Kippur, unlike the opinion of another Sage, as will be explained below.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: There are two refutations </span>against Rabbi Dosa’s interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the belt of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest </span>that he wears on Yom Kippur is made only of linen and <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>identical to <span class="gemarra-regular">the belt of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">common</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> priest, </span>which, in Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion, is made of wool and linen. Therefore, it is impossible for the High Priest’s Yom Kippur garments to be used by a common priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">garments that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you used </span>to perform the services of <span class="gemarra-regular">the most severe</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sanctity, </span>i.e., the services performed by the High Priest on Yom Kippur, can it be that <span class="gemarra-regular">you will </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">use them </span>to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">services of lesser sanctity </span>by a common priest? <span class="gemarra-regular">Instead </span>of this, a different interpretation must be said. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span>then, is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">states </span>the superfluous words <span class="gemarra-regular">“shall he put on”? </span>

Daf 24a

The phrase comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">include worn out </span>garments, teaching that as long as they have not become tattered they may be used for Temple services.
The Gemara continues with another <span class="it-text">baraita</span> connected to this debate. With regard to the garments of the High Priest, the Torah states: “And Aaron shall go into the tent of meeting, and he shall take off the linen garments that he had put on when he went into the Sanctuary, <span class="gemarra-regular">and shall leave them there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Leviticus 16:23). This verse <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that </span>the linen garments worn by the High Priest during the Yom Kippur service <span class="gemarra-regular">require storing away</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., they may not be used again. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa says: </span>They do not have to be stored away, because although they may not be used again by the High Priest on a subsequent Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are acceptable </span>for use <span class="gemarra-regular">for a common priest. And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what, </span>then, is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And shall leave them there,” </span>which implies that they are not to be used again? It means <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the High Priest himself <span class="gemarra-regular">may not use them </span>on a <span class="gemarra-regular">subsequent Yom </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Kippur </span>for service in the Holy of Holies; it does not mean that they may not be used at all.
The Gemara returns to the question of whether or not the removal of the ashes is considered a bona fide Temple service, requiring all four priestly garments, and whether or not this is the subject of debate between <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not with regard to this that </span>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Dosa <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree: One Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda, who derives from the phrase “he shall wear” that all four garments are required, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the removal of the ashes <span class="gemarra-regular">is a </span>bona fide <span class="gemarra-regular">service; and one Sage, </span>Rabbi Dosa, who derives a different teaching from “he shall wear,” <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not a </span>bona fide <span class="gemarra-regular">service, </span>and consequently only two of the four garments are required? Their dispute would therefore be identical to the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: It is possible to say that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the subject of debate between these two <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span>. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone </span>agrees that the removal of ashes <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a bona fide Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service </span>requiring all four garments, <span class="gemarra-regular">and here they disagree about </span>a different point, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">this: One Sage, </span>Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>derivation from the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse is necessary </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">include</span> the mitre and belt, which are not mentioned explicitly in the verse. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one Sage, </span>Rabbi Dosa, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds that </span>since the removal of the ash is a bona fide Temple service it is obvious that all four garments are required, so a derivation from <span class="gemarra-regular">a verse </span>to include the other two garments <span class="gemarra-regular">is not necessary. </span>Accordingly, both <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> are in agreement that the removal of ash is a bona fide service and requires all four priestly garments. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Avin raised a dilemma: How much </span>ash must be removed in order to fulfill the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">removal of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ashes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Do we derive it from the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the tithe, </span>the portion that the Levite sets aside for the priest, in which case one hundredth of the total is separated, <span class="gemarra-regular">or do we derive it from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">donations </span>that were set aside from the spoils of the war with <span class="gemarra-regular">Midian, where </span>one five-hundredth was taken from the spoils of war (see Numbers 31:28)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear</span> a teaching with regard to this dilemma. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Ḥiyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated here: “And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he shall take up </span>the ashes” (Leviticus 6:3), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is said elsewhere, </span>with regard to a meal-offering: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And he shall take up </span>a handful of the choice flour of the meal-offering” (Leviticus 6:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>the amount he removes is <span class="gemarra-regular">a handful </span>of flour, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span><span class="gemarra-regular">too, here, </span>he removes <span class="gemarra-regular">a handful </span>of ash. The amount of ashes removed from the altar is therefore not a fixed percentage of the total ash.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>Although a non-priest may not perform any Temple service, <span class="gemarra-regular">there are </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">services</span> for which <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-priest is liable to </span>receive the punishment of <span class="gemarra-regular">deat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> by God’s hand for doing so. They are: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sprinkling </span>sacrificial blood on the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> burning </span>incense or parts of sacrificial animals on the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>pouring out <span class="gemarra-regular">the water libation </span>on the altar on the festival of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>pouring out <span class="gemarra-regular">the wine libation</span> on the altar. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Lev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>This is true <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the removal of the ashes. And similarly, Levi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught in his </span>collection of <span class="gemarra-italic">baraitot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: The removal of ashes </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>included among those services for which a non-priest incurs the death penalty if he performs them. 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav’s </span>opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “And you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">everything pertaining to the altar and to that within the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">veil; and you shall serve; I give you the priesthood </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as a service of gift; and the common man that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">draws near shall be put to death” </span>(Numbers 18:7). Rav interprets this verse as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">“A service of gift” </span>indicates a service that involves giving, i.e., placing something on the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not a service </span>that involves <span class="gemarra-regular">removal</span> from the altar, to the exclusion of removing the ashes. <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall serve [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">va’avadtem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>is interpreted as referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a service that is complete [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">avoda</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tamma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>on its own, such as sprinkling the blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not </span>a service that is not complete, i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">a service </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is only a preparatory step and <span class="gemarra-regular">has another service </span><span class="gemarra-regular">after it </span>that completes its purpose, such as slaughtering the animal or collecting its blood, which are only preparatory steps leading up to the sprinkling of the blood on the altar.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what is the reason for the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Levi? </span>Why does he include the removal of ashes? According to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One includes </span>this service by adding <span class="gemarra-regular">“in everything pertaining to the altar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>which teaches that all actions performed on the altar, including the removal of ashes, are significant and are prohibited to a non-priest on pain of death. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>learn from the phrase “in everything pertaining to the altar”? The Gemara answers: According to him, the word “everything” in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>phrase comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to include the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seven sprinklings that are </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the Sanctuary, when the blood of certain offerings is sprinkled on the veil of the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the seven sprinklings of oil <span class="gemarra-regular">of the leper, </span>which are also performed inside the Sanctuary. Rav learns from the word “everything” that if a non-priest were to perform any of these actions he would be liable to receive the death penalty, despite the fact that they are not performed on the altar.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> from where does <span class="gemarra-regular">Levi </span>derive these cases? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He derives </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the superfluous wording of the text. As the entire phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“pertaining </span>to the altar” is superfluous, he derives from this the inclusion of the removal of the ashes. Additionally, the expression <span class="gemarra-regular">“everything pertaining” </span>implies a further inclusion, from which he derives the internal sprinklings mentioned above. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>learn from this superfluous wording? Rav does <span class="gemarra-regular">not derive </span>anything particular from the distinction between the expressions <span class="gemarra-regular">“pertaining </span>to the altar” and <span class="gemarra-regular">“everything pertaining </span>to the altar.”
The Gemara asks about Levi’s position: <span class="gemarra-regular">But say </span>that the verse should be interpreted as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">“In everything</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pertaining” </span>is a <span class="gemarra-regular">generalization, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">“a service of gift” </span>is a <span class="gemarra-regular">specification, </span>indicating a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a generalization </span>followed by <span class="gemarra-regular">a specification. </span>One of the principles of hermeneutics states that in such cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">the generalization includes only what </span>is mentioned explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">in the specification. </span>Following that rule, one would conclude: <span class="gemarra-regular">A service of giving, </span>i.e., placing on the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>this is included, but <span class="gemarra-regular">a service of removal </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>included. This presents a difficulty for Levi. The Gemara responds that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: </span>

Daf 24b

<span class="gemarra-regular"> “To that within the veil; and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you shall serve; </span>I give you the priesthood as a service of gift” (Numbers 18:7), indicating that it is only with regard to services that are performed <span class="gemarra-regular">within the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">veil, </span>i.e., in the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">that there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a distinction between services, and a non-priest who performs <span class="gemarra-regular">services of giving </span>there, such as sprinkling the blood inside the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur, is subject to the death penalty, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>one who performs <span class="gemarra-regular">services </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of removing </span>there, such as the removal of the censer from the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>leads to the conclusion that when it comes to services performed <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>of the Holy of Holies, a non-priest would be liable if he performed any service, <span class="gemarra-regular">even a service</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of removal, </span>such as the removal of ashes from the altar.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>that the limitations of the verse apply only to those services performed in the Holy of Holies, one should say that the phrase: “<span class="gemarra-regular">And you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall serve [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">va’avadtem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>from which it is derived that one is liable only for a service that is complete [<span class="it-text">avoda</span> <span class="it-text">tamma</span>] on its own and not incomplete, should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be similarly limited to services performed <span class="gemarra-regular">to what is within</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the veil. </span>In that case, the liability of the non-priest, which is limited to cases where he performs <span class="gemarra-regular">a complete service and </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>apply if he performs <span class="gemarra-regular">a service that </span>is only preparatory and <span class="gemarra-regular">has another service </span><span class="gemarra-regular">after it </span>that completes its purpose, should apply only to services performed in the Holy of Holies. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>for services performed <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>the Holy of Holies, a non-priest should be liable <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a service that </span>is incomplete and <span class="gemarra-regular">has a service after it.</span>
The Gemara answers: The phrase: “<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you shall serve [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">va’avadtem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>which begins with the conjunction <span class="it-text">vav</span>, meaning: And, indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse goes back and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> combines </span>the service performed within the veil to services performed outside of it. This teaches that with regard to this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> there is no difference between a service performed outside and a service performed inside.
According to Levi, if a non-priest performs a service involving removal within the veil, i.e., in the Holy of Holies, he does not incur the death penalty, but if he performs a service involving removal outside, such as the removal of the ashes from the external altar, he is liable to the death penalty. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised a dilemma </span>relating to Levi’s approach: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>would be the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a service of removal </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Sanctuary </span>chamber that is before the Holy of Holies, such as removing the burnt incense from the inner altar, or removing burnt wicks and leftover oil from the candelabrum? Do <span class="gemarra-regular">we compare </span>such an act <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a service performed <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the Holy of Holies, so that he would be exempt from the death penalty, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">we compare </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the outer </span>service? 
Rava himself <span class="gemarra-regular">went back and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> resolved </span>the dilemma: Had the Torah said only: <span class="gemarra-regular">Within </span>the veil, it would have been understood that it is referring only to actions performed in the Holy of Holies. But since the Torah says: <span class="gemarra-regular">And to what is within </span>the veil, the added conjunction: And, teaches that it is referring to something else besides the Holy of Holies, i.e., the Sanctuary.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">so</span> that a non-priest is liable for performing a service that is complete on its own that takes place in the Sanctuary, one should say that <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-priest who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> arrange</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>loaves on the shewbread <span class="gemarra-regular">table should be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>The Gemara answers: After arranging the bread <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>still the <span class="gemarra-regular">arranging of the vessels </span>of frankincense on the table that remains to be done, so the arrangement of the bread is not a service that is complete on its own. The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-priest </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who arranges the vessels </span>of frankincense on the table <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be liable. </span>The Gemara rejects this: After arranging the vessels, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>still the <span class="gemarra-regular">removal </span>of these vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">burning </span>of their frankincense on the altar that remain to be done; therefore, arranging the vessels is not considered a service that is complete on its own.
The Gemara asks further with regard to the notion that a non-priest is liable for performing a service that is complete on its own that takes place in the Sanctuary: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">non-priest who arranges the </span>lamps of the <span class="gemarra-regular">candelabrum should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be liable. </span>The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>still the <span class="gemarra-regular">placing of the wicks </span>in the lamps that remains to be done, so arranging the lamps is not considered a service that is complete on its own. The Gemara asks: If so, a non-priest who <span class="gemarra-regular">placed a wick </span>in the candelabrum’s lamps <span class="gemarra-regular">should be liable. </span>The Gemara answers: That too is not a service that is complete on its own, as <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>still the necessity of <span class="gemarra-regular">placing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the oil. </span>
The Gemara asks: If so, a non-priest who <span class="gemarra-regular">placed the oil should be liable. </span>The Gemara answers: That too is not a service that is complete on its own, as <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>still the service of <span class="gemarra-regular">lighting </span>that needs to be done. The Gemara asks: If so, if a non-priest <span class="gemarra-regular">who lit </span>the lamps <span class="gemarra-regular">should be liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lighting </span>the lamps <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered a bona fide Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service, </span>since in doing so nothing is done to the candelabrum itself.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is </span>kindling a fire really <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered a Temple service? <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fire upon the altar and lay out wood in order </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upon the fire” </span>(Leviticus 1:7), which <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that the kindling</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of chips [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">alita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> added to keep the altar’s fire going must <span class="gemarra-regular">be performed only by a proper priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>that he must be wearing <span class="gemarra-regular">the priestly garments? </span>This shows that kindling is considered a service. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Kindling </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">chips is a </span>bona fide <span class="gemarra-regular">service</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but <span class="gemarra-regular">lighting </span>the candelabrum is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>a bona fide <span class="gemarra-regular">service</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara further asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>that a non-priest is liable for performing any service involving placing, as established above, <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-priest who set up the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">arrangement </span>of wood on the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">should be liable, </span>since that is a service involving placing. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>mitzva of the <span class="gemarra-regular">arrangement of two log</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> on the altar that remains to be done, so that setting up the arrangement of wood is not a service that is complete on its own. The Gemara asks: If so, a non-priest who <span class="gemarra-regular">arranged the two logs</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should be liable. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> arrangement of limbs </span>of offerings on the fire that remains to be done, so placing the two logs is also not considered a service that is complete on its own. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rav Asi say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: A non-priest who arranged the two pieces of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wood is liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> This shows that placing the two logs is a complete service and contradicts Rav’s statement that a non-priest is liable only if he performs the four services that he mentioned above. The Gemara answers: Indeed, Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree on this </span>point. <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sage, </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the placement of the two logs <span class="gemarra-regular">is a service that is complete </span>on its own, as the arrangement of limbs that follows is not considered a continuation of the setting up of the wood; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one Sage, </span>Rav, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the placement of the two logs <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a service that is complete</span> on its own, since it is followed by the arrangement of the limbs on the wood.
The Gemara returns to the disagreement between Rav and Levi and notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught </span>in a second <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Levi. It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav: </span>These are the <span class="gemarra-regular">services for which a non-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">priest </span>who performs them <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable to </span>receive the penalty of <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>by God’s hand: One who performs <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling of blood, whether inside </span>the Sanctuary; on the golden altar or at the veil; <span class="gemarra-regular">or inside the innermost </span>chamber, the Holy of Holies, on Yom Kippur; or outside on the main altar; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who sprinkles </span>blood in the case of a <span class="gemarra-regular">bird sin-offering; and one who squeezes</span> the blood of <span class="gemarra-regular">a bird burnt-offering </span>on the wall of the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">or burns </span>the bird on the altar; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who pours out three </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of water </span>on the altar for the <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> water libation <span class="gemarra-regular">or three </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of wine </span>on the altar for an ordinary libation. The removal of ashes from the altar is not listed here.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Levi: </span>These are the <span class="gemarra-regular">services for which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a non-priest </span>who performs them <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable to </span>receive the penalty of <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>by God’s hand: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> removes the ashes </span>from the altar; one who performs <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seven sprinklings that are </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the Sanctuary <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>the sprinklings <span class="gemarra-regular">of the leper; and one who raises up </span>an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">onto the altar, whether it is </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">proper </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified </span>one. In this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the removal of ashes is listed.
§ The Gemara returns to its interpretation of the mishna. The mishna states that there were four lotteries held in the Temple every day. One of the Sages asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why did </span>the Temple authorities <span class="gemarra-regular">hold lotteries? </span>Before answering the question, the Gemara expresses astonishment at the question itself: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why did they hold lotteries? </span>The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we said </span>clearly in the mishna: To prevent quarrels among the priests. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this is the meaning of the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why did they </span>assemble all the priests together and <span class="gemarra-regular">hold a lottery, and once again </span>gather them together to <span class="gemarra-regular">hold another lottery, </span>four times, when the priests could be gathered one time and all the necessary lotteries held at that time? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>It was done this way <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to create a commotion throughout </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, </span>as the priests would converge from all over to assemble there, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “We took sweet counsel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> together, in the House of God we walked with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> throng” </span>(Psalms 55:15). This verse teaches that it is proper to stir up a commotion and to cause public excitement in the course of the Temple services and the preliminary steps leading up to them, such as the assignment of tasks to the priests.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what </span>garments were the priests clothed when <span class="gemarra-regular">they held the lottery</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Naḥman said: </span>The priests were clothed in their own <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred garments. And Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sheshet</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>The priests were dressed in the priestly <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred </span><span class="gemarra-regular">garments</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara explains the two approaches. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>The priests were dressed in <span class="gemarra-regular">non</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-sacred garments, because if you say </span>the lottery was to be held when they were dressed in their <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred garments</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, there are </span>strong-<span class="gemarra-regular">armed men who might act with force</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and perform the service </span>even if they did not win the lottery. Since they were already wearing the sacred garments, they would simply force their way into performing the service. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: </span>They were wearing the <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred garments, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, if you say </span>they wore their <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred garments, due</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the fact that the service was so <span class="gemarra-regular">beloved </span>to them, in their excitement over having been granted the privilege to perform the service, <span class="gemarra-regular">it may happen </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> perform the service </span>immediately, forgetting to don their sacred garments, thereby disqualifying the service. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman said: From where do I state </span>my opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we learned </span>in a mishna: After the lottery <span class="gemarra-regular">they gave</span> the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">over to the attendants</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> take their clothes off them and they would leave only</span> their <span class="gemarra-regular">trousers on them. </span>

Daf 25a

<span class="gemarra-regular">What, is </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>talking <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span><span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>priests <span class="gemarra-regular">who won the lottery, </span>describing how their non-sacred garments were removed from them before they were dressed in the priestly garments? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said, </span>rejecting that interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is possible to explain that all the priests at the lottery were wearing sacred garments and that, on the contrary, the mishna speaks <span class="gemarra-regular">about those </span>priests <span class="gemarra-regular">who did not win the lottery</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The text describes how the sacred garments they wore during the lottery were removed from them.
The Gemara supports this latter interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, it is reasonable </span>to follow Rav Sheshet’s interpretation of the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it were to enter your mind </span>to say that the mishna is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with those who won the lottery </span>and describes how their non-sacred garments were removed and sacred garments put on, how would one understand the statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would leave only their trousers on them? </span>One would have to explain that the priests subsequently donned the sacred clothes on top of the non-sacred trousers; then they would remove the non-sacred trousers and replace them with the sacred trousers. <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that nothing should precede the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">trousers </span>when the priest dresses? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “And he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall have linen trousers upon his flesh” </span>(Leviticus 16:4)? However, according to the proposed interpretation of the mishna, the priests donned the other sacred garments and put on the trousers after them.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how would <span class="gemarra-regular">the other</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one, </span>Rav Naḥman, resolve this difficulty? He would respond that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is not difficult, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: While the non-sacred garments are still </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on them they put the sacred trousers on them, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">they remove </span>from them <span class="gemarra-regular">the non-sacred clothes, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they left </span>them wearing <span class="gemarra-regular">only the </span>sacred <span class="gemarra-regular">trousers. </span>Therefore, it is possible to interpret the mishna either way.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: From where do I say </span>that the priests wore sacred garments when the lottery was held? <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Chamber of Hewn </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Stone was </span>built <span class="gemarra-regular">in the style of a large basilica [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">basileki</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the lottery </span>is held <span class="gemarra-regular">in the east </span>of the chamber, <span class="gemarra-regular">and an Elder </span>of the court <span class="gemarra-regular">sits in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its wes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> to provide instruction and adjudicate any doubtful cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the priests stand in a circle in the shape</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a bracelet [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bekholyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the appointed </span>priest <span class="gemarra-regular">comes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and removes the mitre from the head of one of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them, and </span>everyone thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">knew that the count began from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him. And if it were to enter your mind </span>to say that the priests wore <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred garments </span>during the lottery, <span class="gemarra-regular">is there </span>such a thing as <span class="gemarra-regular">a mitre among</span> one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred garments? </span>This shows that the priests were wearing their sacred garments when the lottery took place.
The Gemara rejects this reasoning: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>indeed, there is such a thing as a mitre that one wears as non-sacred apparel, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Yehuda, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Yehuda, taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> A priest whose mother made a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tunic for him, </span>to show her love for her son and her love for mitzvot, <span class="gemarra-regular">may perform an individual service</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with it on, </span>but not communal services. Therefore, it is possible that the priests had non-sacred mitres in the style of the sacred mitres, just as they sometimes had non-sacred tunics.
Apropos the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that was just cited, <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Conclude from this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Hewn Ston</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> was built <span class="gemarra-regular">half in the sacred </span>area, within the consecrated Temple grounds, <span class="gemarra-regular">and half in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> non-sacred </span>part of the Temple grounds. <span class="gemarra-regular">And conclude </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from it </span>as well that the chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">had two doorways, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">opened to the sacred </span>area of the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">opened to the non-sacred </span>area. Abaye explains these inferences: <span class="gemarra-regular">As, were it to enter your mind</span> that the Chamber of Hewn Stone stood <span class="gemarra-regular">entirely in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sacred </span>area, how could one say that <span class="gemarra-regular">an Elder </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sat in its west? Didn’t the Master say: There </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is no sitting </span>allowed <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard except for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">kings of the house of Davi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> alone? </span>The Elder must therefore have been sitting in an area external to the Temple courtyard area.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it were to enter your mind </span>to say the opposite, that the chamber stood <span class="gemarra-regular">entirely in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> non-sacred </span>area, how could <span class="gemarra-regular">the lottery </span>be held <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the east? Aren’t we required </span>to fulfill the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“In the House of God we walked with the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">throng” </span>(Psalms 55:15), from where it was derived earlier that it is desirable that the lotteries cause a commotion in the House of God, i.e., in the sacred area of the Temple? If the lottery were held in a non-sacred area, <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">not be </span>a fulfillment of this verse. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>one must <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the chamber was situated <span class="gemarra-regular">half in the sacred </span>area of the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">and half in the non-sacred </span>area.
Abaye continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And were it to enter your mind </span>that the chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">had </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">one doorway, which opened to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sacred </span>area, how could the <span class="gemarra-regular">Elder sit in its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">west? Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Chambers that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are built in the non-sacred </span>area of the Temple Mount, but that <span class="gemarra-regular">open up into the sacred </span>area, <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">interior is </span>considered entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred, </span>despite the fact that they also occupy land outside the sacred area? <span class="gemarra-regular">And if,</span> on the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">it were to enter your mind</span> that the chamber had just one doorway, <span class="gemarra-regular">which opened to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the non-sacred </span>area, how could the <span class="gemarra-regular">lottery </span>be held <span class="gemarra-regular">in its east? Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna: With regard to chambers that are <span class="gemarra-regular">built in the sacred</span> area but which <span class="gemarra-regular">open up into the non-sacred </span>area, the space <span class="gemarra-regular">within them is </span>considered entirely <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred, </span>despite the chambers’ location on sacred territory. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, isn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>correct to <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from this </span>that the Chamber of Hewn Stone <span class="gemarra-regular">had two doorways, one that opened up into </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the sacred </span>area <span class="gemarra-regular">and one that opened into the non-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">sacred </span>area?
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The second </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lotter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> conducted daily among the priests determines the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who slaughters</span> the daily morning offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">who sprinkles </span>its blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">who removes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the ashes </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">the inner altar, and who removes the</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">ashe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> and burnt wicks from <span class="gemarra-regular">the candelabrum, and who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">takes the limbs </span>of the daily offering <span class="gemarra-regular">up to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ramp </span>to be burned later. 
This is how the limbs were divided before taking them up to the altar: <span class="gemarra-regular">The head and the </span>right <span class="gemarra-regular">leg </span>were carried by one priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the two forelegs </span>were carried by a second priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">The tail, </span>including the lower vertebrae of the spinal column and the fat tail, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span>left <span class="gemarra-regular">leg </span>were carried by a third priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the breast</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the throat </span>and some of the inner organs attached to it were carried by a fourth priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two flanks </span>were taken by a fifth priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> intestines </span>by a sixth priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the fine flour </span>of the meal-offering accompanying the daily offering was carried by a seventh priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span>High Priest’s daily <span class="gemarra-regular">griddle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-cake offering </span>was carried by an eighth priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wine </span>for libation was carried by a ninth priest. Altogether <span class="gemarra-regular">thirteen priests prevailed in this </span>lottery: Nine priests who carried the daily offering and its accompanying elements, and four who performed the slaughter, sprinkling, and removal of ashes from the inner altar and the candelabrum. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ben Azzai</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said before Rabbi Akiva in the name of RabbiYehoshua</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>That was not the sequence of taking the limbs up to the ramp; rather, the order in which <span class="gemarra-regular">it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sacrificed </span>was according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the way it walks </span>when alive, as will be explained in the Gemara. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">When the priests</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> performed the lottery, did they perform a lottery for </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">one service, </span>such as the slaughtering, and the other twelve tasks were divided among the priests adjacent to the chosen one; <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps they performed a </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">lottery for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">each and every service </span>of the thirteen acts listed? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from that which was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">There were four lotteries there. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And if it were to enter your mind </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">performed a lottery </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">each and every service </span>separately, <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would be many </span>more than four lotteries. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yitzḥak said: </span>That is not a conclusive proof, because one could argue that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">issaying: </span>The priests <span class="gemarra-regular">gathered four times for a lottery, but each </span>gathering involved <span class="gemarra-regular">many lotteries </span>for many individual services. 

Daf 25b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>When the third lottery was held to determine who would perform the burning of the incense, <span class="gemarra-regular">there was no </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">lottery </span>held for carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">the coal pan, </span>although a second priest was required to rake up coals from the outer altar, carry them in a coal pan, and put them on the inner altar, where the priest assigned the task of burning the incense would then place the incense onto the coals. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">priest who won </span>the privilege <span class="gemarra-regular">of the incense said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the one who was next to him: Be privileged along</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with me with </span>the task of carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">the coal pan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This shows that each individual service did not have its own lottery; rather, the other priests adjacent to the winner of the lottery were automatically chosen for the ancillary tasks. 
The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>tasks of carrying the <span class="gemarra-regular">coal pan and </span>burning the <span class="gemarra-regular">incense are different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, because </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">they are </span>considered as <span class="gemarra-regular">a single service, </span>so that a single lottery determined the participants for the two tasks.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are</span> those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> was brought to derive the opposite conclusion: It was <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>concerning the case of carrying <span class="gemarra-regular">the coal pan and </span>burning <span class="gemarra-regular">the incense, which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>considered as two parts of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>and the same <span class="gemarra-regular">service, </span>that Rabbi Yehuda said one lottery can be used to assign the two tasks. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>the implication is that <span class="gemarra-regular">other services, </span>which are not interrelated in this manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">require</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a lottery </span>for each and every separate task. If Rabbi Yehuda had meant this to be a general principle, why did he mention the specific example of the coal pan and the incense?
This argument is rejected: That is not a proof that other services require their own lotteries. The reason Rabbi Yehuda mentioned this specific example is that <span class="gemarra-regular">it was necessary for him </span>to teach explicitly that the coal pan and the burning of the incense do not have separate lotteries but a single, combined lottery. It might <span class="gemarra-regular">have entered your mind to say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that since </span>the burning of incense <span class="gemarra-regular">is infrequent, </span>being performed only twice a day, unlike other offerings, which may be donated by private individuals and brought many times a day, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also since <span class="gemarra-regular">it brings about wealth </span>for whoever performs it, as the Gemara teaches later, <span class="gemarra-regular">we should institute a</span> separate <span class="gemarra-regular">lottery for </span>bringing in the coal pan <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, </span>as many priests wished to perform this task. Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that despite this, the bringing in of the coal pan does not have its own lottery. Consequently, there is no proof either way from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya taught </span>explicitly in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A lottery is not held for each individual service; rather, </span>beginning with the <span class="gemarra-regular">priest who won the lottery of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">daily offering, twelve of his fellow priests, </span>those standing next to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">are drawn in along with hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> to perform the other acts of the daily offering. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from this </span>that it is so.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The second lottery </span>determines who slaughters, who sprinkles the blood, etc. The task of collecting the blood in a vessel, which is between slaughtering and sprinkling, is not mentioned. Therefore, it must be assumed that either the priest who slaughtered or the priest who sprinkled the blood was assigned this task as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who collects </span>the blood? Is it the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughters </span>the offering who also <span class="gemarra-regular">collects </span>the blood? The reason to support this conclusion is <span class="gemarra-regular">that if you say </span>that the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkles </span>the blood is the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">collects </span>it, a situation might arise in which, <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>his enthusiasm and <span class="gemarra-regular">his love </span>for the mitzva of sprinkling, a service that is considered more important than collecting because it directly involves the altar, the priest might <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">collect all the bloo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> as the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> requires but would hurry to go on and sprinkle it after he has collected only some of the blood. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>one should draw the opposite conclusion, that it is the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkles </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">collects</span> the blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">as, if you say </span>that the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughters </span>is the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">collects, </span>this principle could not be universally applied, as <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes a non-priest slaughters </span>the offering. Slaughtering offerings is not a sacred service and may be performed by anyone, unlike the collection of the blood, which is performed by a priest. In those cases when a non-priest slaughtered the daily offering, he would not be able to collect the blood.
The Gemara cites a source as evidence for one side of the argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear</span> from that which was taught in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ben Katin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> made twelve spigot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the </span>large <span class="gemarra-regular">laver </span>to replace the original two spouts that were there, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">twelve fellow priests who were engaged in </span>the sacrifice of <span class="gemarra-regular">the daily offering could </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctify their hands and feet </span><span class="gemarra-regular">at one time. </span>Although there are thirteen participants listed in the mishna, the slaughterer of the offering was not required to sanctify his hands and feet because, as mentioned above, slaughtering is not a sacred service. Therefore, only twelve spigots were needed. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it should enter your mind </span>to say that the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughters </span>is the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">collects </span>the blood, then <span class="gemarra-regular">there are </span>sometimes <span class="gemarra-regular">thirteen </span>participants, so thirteen spigots should be needed. On those occasions when a non-priest slaughtered the daily offering, an extra priest would be required to come and collect its blood. Since the collection of blood is a sacred service, it too requires sanctification of the hands and feet. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>since there were only twelve spigots, <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it </span>correct to <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>that it is the one who <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkles, </span>and not the one who slaughters, who <span class="gemarra-regular">collects </span>the blood? The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from this </span>that it is so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, said to Rav Ashi: We too have learned </span>a support for this conclusion in a mishna that gives the sequence of the services for the daily offering: <span class="gemarra-regular">The slaughterer </span>of the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered, the collector </span>of its blood <span class="gemarra-regular">collected, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to sprinkle </span>the blood. The wording indicates that the one who collects the blood is also the one who subsequently sprinkles it. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>that it is so.
§ The mishna states that <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Azzai said before Rabbi Akiva </span>in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua that the sequence for carrying up the animal’s limbs was based on the way it walks when alive, meaning that its front parts are taken up first. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what manner </span>is the animal brought up according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the way it walks? </span>It is in this manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">head and the </span>right hind <span class="gemarra-regular">leg </span>are brought up first. The other parts follow this sequence: <span class="gemarra-regular">The breast and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">neck, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the two forelegs, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">flanks, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the tail and the </span>left hind <span class="gemarra-regular">leg. Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosei says: It was sacrificed </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the way it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was skinned. In what manner </span>is the animal brought up according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the way it was skinned? </span>It is in this manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">The head and the </span>right <span class="gemarra-regular">leg </span>are brought first, then <span class="gemarra-regular">the tail and the </span>left <span class="gemarra-regular">leg </span>together, then the <span class="gemarra-regular">two flanks, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the two forelegs, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">breast and the neck.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says: It was sacrificed </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the way it was cut up </span>into limbs after the skinning. <span class="gemarra-regular">In what manner </span>is the animal brought up according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the way it was cut up? </span>It is in this manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">The head and the </span>right <span class="gemarra-regular">leg </span>first, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the two forelegs, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the breast and the neck, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the two flanks, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the tail and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>left <span class="gemarra-regular">leg. Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: It was sacrificed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">quality </span>of its various sections, so that the best pieces were taken up first. <span class="gemarra-regular">In what manner </span>is the animal brought up according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the quality </span>of the pieces? It is in this manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">The head and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>right <span class="gemarra-regular">leg, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the breast and the neck, and</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">the two flanks, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the tail and the </span>left <span class="gemarra-regular">leg, and </span>then the <span class="gemarra-regular">two forelegs.</span>
The Gemara poses a question with regard to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s position: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: “Every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder” </span>(Ezekiel 24:4), indicating that these are the best cuts of the animal? Why doesn’t Rabbi Yosei HaGelili say that these are offered first (Rabbeinu Ḥananel)? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>verse is speaking of a <span class="gemarra-regular">lean </span>sheep, whose thigh and shoulder are indeed the best pieces. However, in the sheep brought for the daily offering, which were of the finest quality, there were other parts that were of higher quality.
The Gemara explains the reason behind the order of the pieces in the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Both the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">our </span>mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosei </span>HaGelili agree that <span class="gemarra-regular">we follow the </span>relative <span class="gemarra-regular">quality </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the meat </span>in the various pieces. The difference in opinion between them is that one <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of this mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">follows the limb, </span>i.e., the amount, <span class="gemarra-regular">of the meat; </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Yosei, <span class="gemarra-regular">follows the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fattiness of the meat.</span>
The Gemara asks: According to all opinions, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason that </span>the right <span class="gemarra-regular">leg goes up </span>to the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">together with the head? </span>What is the connection between these two pieces? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> head has much bone in it, the leg is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">offered</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara asks further: Although the Sages disagree as to the order of bringing up the various pieces, <span class="gemarra-regular">at any rate everyone agrees </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">head is sacrificed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first. From where do we </span>derive this? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> when sacrificing an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">the head and the fat precede</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">limbs? The verse states: </span>“And he shall cut it up into its pieces <span class="gemarra-regular">and its head </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and its fat, and </span>the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">shall arrange </span>them on the wood that is on the fire upon the altar” (Leviticus 1:12). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the other </span>mention of <span class="gemarra-regular">fa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> before this, where the verse states: “The pieces, the head and the fat” (Leviticus 1:8), 

Daf 26a

<span class="gemarra-regular">what does </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>to teach us? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what manner would </span>the priest placing the pieces on the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>so? <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">place the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fat </span>right <span class="gemarra-regular">over the place of slaughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that is, on the cut neck, <span class="gemarra-regular">and bring it up </span>that way, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that is the </span>most <span class="gemarra-regular">respectful way toward the Most</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> High, </span>that the bloody point of slaughter not be exposed.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Before <span class="gemarra-regular">the third </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lottery</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the appointee declared: Let only those priests who are <span class="gemarra-regular">new to </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">the incense </span>come and <span class="gemarra-regular">participate in the lottery </span>for the incense. <span class="gemarra-regular">The fourth </span>lottery was open to those <span class="gemarra-regular">new </span>to the service along <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">old </span>hands who had already performed it,to determine <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">take the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">limbs up from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ramp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where they had been placed earlier, <span class="gemarra-regular">to the altar. </span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">No person ever performed </span>the service of the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">twice, </span>as a new priest was always found for this service. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the reason </span>that they were insistent that no priest should be assigned this task more than once in his life? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it brings wealth</span> to the one who performs it. Since bringing the incense was a blessing for wealth, it was decided that as many different priests as possible should have an opportunity to do this service.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to Abaye: What is the reason </span>for this assertion that the one who burns the incense becomes wealthy? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we say it is because it is written: “They shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">put incense before You </span>and whole burnt-offerings on Your altar” (Deuteronomy 33:10), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written </span>immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">after that: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Bless, O Lord, his substance” </span>(Deuteronomy 33:11), <span class="gemarra-regular">if so, </span>we should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>make the same assertion concerning those who perform the sacrifice of <span class="gemarra-regular">a burnt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> since it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written </span>in that same verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And whole burnt-offerings </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on Your altar.” </span>
Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>There is a difference between the two: <span class="gemarra-regular">This, </span>the sacrifice of a burnt-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">is frequent, and that, </span>the burning of incense, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">infrequent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> There were many burnt-offerings, both obligatory and voluntary, brought during the course of a day, whereas the incense was burned only twice a day. It is logical to assume that the blessing of riches was not extended to the many priests who participated in the burnt-offerings, but to the few priests who performed the burning of the incense.
Apropos this passage in Deuteronomy, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: You do not find a young Torah scholar who gives</span> halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">instructio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> unless he comes from the tribe of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Levi or from the tribe of Issachar. </span>The assertion with regard to the tribe of <span class="gemarra-regular">Levi </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written: “They shall teach Jacob Your ordinances </span>and Israel Your law” (Deuteronomy 33:10). And the assertion with regard to the tribe of <span class="gemarra-regular">Issachar </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And of the children of Issachar, men that had understanding </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the times, to know what Israel should do” </span>(I Chronicles 12:33). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And say </span>that scholars come from the tribe of <span class="gemarra-regular">Judah also, as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written: “Judah is my lawgiver” </span>(Psalms 60:9). Rava answers: While it is true that the tribe of Judah also taught Torah, in my statement <span class="gemarra-regular">I was speaking </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> those who </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">draw conclusions according to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Although Judah produces great scholars, men capable of translating abstract analysis of the Torah into legal principles come from the two tribes mentioned.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">They did not hold </span>a separate <span class="gemarra-regular">lottery </span>for the slaughtering and sacrifice of the <span class="gemarra-regular">daily afternoon offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rather, </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">priest who won </span>a particular privilege for <span class="gemarra-regular">the morning </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">wins </span>the privilege for the corresponding task in the <span class="gemarra-regular">evening, </span>i.e., for the <span class="gemarra-regular">afternoon </span>service. In this way, the morning lottery covered both services. The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as they hold a lottery </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the morning, so too, they hold a lottery in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the afternoon. </span>This shows that there was a separate lottery for the daily afternoon offering. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When that</span> <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught, </span>it referred only <span class="gemarra-regular">to the incense, </span>which, as stated above, was given to a different priest each time it was offered. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as they hold a lottery for it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] in the morning, so too, they hold a lottery</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for it [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] in the afternoon. </span>The masculine pronoun <span class="it-text">lo</span> indicates that it is not referring to the incense, which is a feminine noun in Hebrew, but to the daily afternoon offering, which is described by a masculine noun. The Gemara answers: Change the wording of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Lah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>using the feminine pronoun instead of the masculine <span class="it-text">lo</span>, so that it is indeed referring to the incense.
The Gemara asks further: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it taught</span> in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as they hold a lottery for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the morning, so too, they hold a lottery</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for it [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] in the afternoon; and just as they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hold a lottery for it [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] in the morning, so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> too, they hold a lottery for it [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> afternoon. </span>This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> makes the statement twice, once using the masculine pronoun and once using the feminine pronoun, which shows that there was a separate lottery in the afternoon not only for the incense but also for the daily offering. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>There is no contradiction. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>in this last <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing with Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> when a second lottery in the afternoon was necessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">since the priestly rotations </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are renewed </span>each Shabbat. On Shabbat the outgoing watch of priests performs the morning service, and the incoming watch performs the afternoon service. Therefore, the same priest could not perform the service of both the morning and afternoon offerings, necessitating a second lottery on that day to designate priests for the various afternoon tasks.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to what we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thought initially, </span>that there was a separate lottery each day for the daily afternoon offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">there would be </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">many </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lotteries, </span>as the mishna states that there were just four lotteries daily. How was it conceivable even to consider such a possibility? The Gemara answers: The thought was that <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">would come </span>and assemble just once, <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the morning</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> for both lotteries, and the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">who would win </span>the lottery for sacrificing <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>daily <span class="gemarra-regular">morning </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">would win </span>that privilege for the morning only, and the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">who would win </span>the lottery for sacrificing <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span> daily <span class="gemarra-regular">afternoon </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">would win </span>the privilege for the afternoon.
§ The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">The fourth </span>lottery was open to those <span class="gemarra-regular">new </span>to the service along <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">old </span>hands who had already performed it, to determine who would take the limbs up from the ramp to the altar. The Gemara states: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov. As we learned </span>in a mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Tamid</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The priest <span class="gemarra-regular">who takes the limbs up to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ramp is the one who takes them up </span>from the ramp <span class="gemarra-regular">to the altar. </span>In contrast, according to the mishna discussed here, it is implied that a different priest won the privilege for the latter service in the lottery.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what do they disagree? One Sage, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna discussed here, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that it is proper to follow the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“In the multitude of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">people is the king’s glory” </span>(Proverbs 14:28). It is a glorification of God for many priests to participate in the service, so different priests were assigned the task of taking the limbs to the ramp, and others were tasked with carrying them up the ramp to the altar. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one Sage, </span>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not proper conduct </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the place of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Divine Presence </span>to have two sets of priests for these tasks, as it gives the appearance that the first set does not want to be bothered to take the limbs up to the altar.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, </span>who holds that the same priest who brought the limbs to the ramp also brought them up to the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>the same opinion as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who holds that there is no separate lottery for the privilege of carrying the coal pan for the incense. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not of </span>the same opinion as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ya’akov. </span>As, <span class="gemarra-regular">if it would be so </span>that these two Sages agreed with each other, <span class="gemarra-regular">there would be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">too few lotteries; </span>there would be only three lotteries rather than four. Rather, one must say that according to Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, who maintains that there was no lottery held for taking the limbs up to the altar, there was a fourth lottery to determine who would carry the coal pan; and according to Rabbi Yehuda, who maintains that there was no lottery for carrying the coal pan, there must have been a lottery for carrying the limbs up to the ramp. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you find a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">who teaches </span>that there were <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>lotteries for the Temple service, 

Daf 26b

the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">tanna</span> would be <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with neither </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eliezer ben Ya’akov nor </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as these five lotteries would include one for carrying the coal pan and another one for taking the limbs up to the altar.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The <span class="gemarra-regular">daily offering is sacrificed </span>and its limbs are carried <span class="gemarra-regular">by nine </span>priests, as mentioned in a previous mishna. These nine carry the limbs and the accompanying libations and meal-offerings. Occasionally, the service is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by ten </span>priests, occasionally <span class="gemarra-regular">by eleven, </span>and sometimes <span class="gemarra-regular">by twelve</span> priests; <span class="gemarra-regular">no fewer </span>than nine <span class="gemarra-regular">and no more </span>than twelve. <span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>The daily offering <span class="gemarra-regular">itself </span>is sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">by nine</span> priests, as explained earlier. <span class="gemarra-regular">On the festival </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>whose <span class="gemarra-regular">hand </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a jug of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> for the water libation is added, and <span class="gemarra-regular">there are ten </span>priests. On <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, a water libation is poured on the altar in addition to the standard wine libation. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">In </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>daily <span class="gemarra-regular">afternoon </span>offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">eleven </span>priests participate in the service. How so? The daily offering <span class="gemarra-regular">itself </span>is sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">by nine, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there are an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>priests <span class="gemarra-regular">in whose hands </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">two logs </span>that are placed on the altar. The mitzva of placing the two logs in the morning was assigned in the first lottery, as the Gemara explained earlier. <span class="gemarra-regular">On Shabbat, eleven </span>priests participate. How so? The daily morning offering <span class="gemarra-regular">itself </span>is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by nine, and </span>there are an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>priests <span class="gemarra-regular">in whose hands </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">two vessels </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of frankincens</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that accompany <span class="gemarra-regular">the shewbread. </span>This frankincense is burned on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">And on Shabbat that </span>occurs <span class="gemarra-regular">within the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">festival </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> there is an additional priest <span class="gemarra-regular">in whose </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hand </span>is a <span class="gemarra-regular">jug of water </span>for the water libation, for a total of twelve priests.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan, said: On the festival </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">they pour the water libation only </span>during the sacrifice of <span class="gemarra-regular">the daily morning offering </span>and not in the afternoon. <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is this derived? It is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is taught </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shabbat that </span>occurs <span class="gemarra-regular">within the festival </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> there is a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">in whose hand </span>is a <span class="gemarra-regular">jug of water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>bringing the number of participating priests to twelve. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it should enter your mind </span>to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">they pour</span> water <span class="gemarra-regular">during the daily afternoon offering </span>also, if <span class="gemarra-regular">so, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you find </span>that there were twelve priests on <span class="gemarra-regular">a weekday </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>that is, during the intermediate days of the Festival: Nine priests for the daily offering, two to carry the logs, and one to pour the water.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">We too have learned </span>this in a different mishna, that the water libation was offered only in the morning, as it was taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">And they would say to the pourer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Raise your han</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> so everyone will see as you pour the water into the aperture on the altar, in accordance with the proper procedure. This was done <span class="gemarra-regular">because one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">time </span>a Sadducee priest, who did not accept that there is a mitzva of water libation, <span class="gemarra-regular">poured </span>the water <span class="gemarra-regular">onto </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his feet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whereupon <span class="gemarra-regular">all the people pelted him with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">etrogim</span> in anger. Since the episode involved <span class="it-text">etrogim</span>, it is apparent that it took place in the morning, when people have their <span class="it-text">etrogim</span> with them. Since the mishna mentions the fact that it was <span class="it-text">etrogim</span> that were used to pelt the priest, it is apparently coming to teach that the water libation takes place only in the morning. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from this </span>that it is so.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon ben Yoḥai says: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the daily afternoon offering requires </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">two logs </span>be brought along with it, and that they must be brought <span class="gemarra-regular">by two priests? As it is stated </span>with regard to the burnt-offering: “The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">and lay out woo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> [<span class="gemarra-italic">etzim</span>] in order upon the fire” (Leviticus 1:7). The word <span class="it-text">etzim</span> is plural, which teaches that two logs are called for. <span class="gemarra-regular">If this is not applicable to the daily morning</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> offering, as it is </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">written about </span>the morning offering explicitly: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the priest shall burn wood on it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">every morning, and arrange </span>the burnt-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">on it” </span>(Leviticus 6:5), <span class="gemarra-regular">apply it to the daily afternoon offering. </span>The verse therefore teaches us that two logs should be added before that offering.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this and this, </span>i.e., both verses cited above, are dealing with <span class="gemarra-regular">the daily morning offering, and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perform </span>the arrangement of wood <span class="gemarra-regular">and then return and perform </span>it again. In other words, perhaps the Torah’s intention is that two logs be arranged on the altar twice in the morning, and that accounts for the two verses. The Gemara rejects this possibility: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it were <span class="gemarra-regular">so, </span>the text <span class="gemarra-regular">should</span> use the same expression both times and <span class="gemarra-regular">say: “And he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall burn </span>wood on it,” and again: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall burn </span>wood on it.” Since the text does not do so, but instead employs two different verbs, saying: “They shall lay out wood” once and: “He shall burn wood” the second time, this indicates that the Torah is describing two different times. 
The Gemara rejects this inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the Merciful One had written </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall burn </span>wood on it” twice, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have said </span>it means that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>priest should arrange the wood, <span class="gemarra-regular">not two. </span>The change of terminology to a plural verb is therefore necessary because <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches us </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>priest <span class="gemarra-regular">should perform </span>it the first time <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>priests <span class="gemarra-regular">should perform </span>it the second time, but they are both performed in the morning.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>if this were what the Torah wished to indicate, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: “And he shall burn </span>wood” in the singular, and then, in the second verse, say: <span class="gemarra-regular">And they shall burn</span> wood, in the plural, using the same verb both times, changing only the number of the verb. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or, alternatively, </span>the verse should say: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he shall lay out </span>wood, in the singular, and then, in the second verse, say: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they shall lay out </span>wood,” in the plural. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the reason the Torah uses two different verbs in the two verses, stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall burn </span>wood” <span class="gemarra-regular">and then: “And they shall lay out </span>wood”? <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from this as we have said, </span>that the Torah in these two verses is referring to two separate times of day, and the verse: “They shall lay out wood [<span class="it-text">etzim</span>]” is referring to the daily afternoon offering, mandating that at that time “they,” i.e., two priests, shall lay out <span class="it-text">etzim</span>, the plural term for wood, referring to two logs.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sometimes thirteen </span>priests were involved in sacrificing the daily offering, all these tasks being assigned in the second lottery, as the mishna taught earlier. But <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes fourteen </span>priests are chosen in this manner to participate, since on <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> an additional priest is chosen to pour the water libation. And <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fifteen </span>priests are chosen, on Shabbat, when two priests are tasked with burning the frankincense in the vessels. And <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sixteen </span>priests are chosen, on Shabbat that occurs during <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, when three extra priests are added: One to pour the water and two to burn the frankincense. 
The Gemara asks with regard to Rabbi Ḥiyya’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that sometimes there are <span class="gemarra-regular">seventee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> priests involved in the daily offering? 
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. </span>The seventeenth task of the daily morning offering referred to in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is taking up the pieces of the offering from the ramp to the altar. According to Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, this task was not assigned to a new priest but was performed by the same priests who had brought the pieces to the ramp. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which does assign this task to a seventeenth priest, is therefore not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov. As the Gemara explained earlier, the opinions of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov are mutually exclusive; consequently, since the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, it must be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Ḥiyya, however, adopted the view of Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov, and for this reason he taught that the maximum number of tasks assigned through the second lottery is only sixteen.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A ram </span>that is brought for a communal burnt-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">is sacrificed by eleven </span>priests. <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> flesh </span>on the various limbs is taken <span class="gemarra-regular">by five </span>priests, as in the case of the sheep of the daily offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">The intestines, and the fine flour </span>of the meal-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the wine </span>of the libation are carried by <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>priests <span class="gemarra-regular">each, </span>because the meal-offering and wine libation that accompany a ram are larger than those that accompany a sheep. <span class="gemarra-regular">A bull </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificed by twenty-four </span>priests. How so? <span class="gemarra-regular">The head and the </span>right <span class="gemarra-regular">leg </span>are sacrificed first, but due to its size <span class="gemarra-regular">the head </span>is carried <span class="gemarra-regular">by one </span>priest <span class="gemarra-regular">and the leg by two. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The tail and the </span>left <span class="gemarra-regular">leg </span>are carried as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">The tail </span>is sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">by two and the leg by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two. The breast and the neck </span>are carried as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">The breast </span>is offered <span class="gemarra-regular">by one and the neck </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by three </span>priests. The <span class="gemarra-regular">two forelegs </span>are carried <span class="gemarra-regular">by two </span>priests, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the two flanks </span>are carried <span class="gemarra-regular">by two. The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> intestines and the fine flour and the wine </span>are carried <span class="gemarra-regular">by three each, </span>because the meal-offering and wine libation that accompany a bull are larger than those that accompany a ram.
<span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said, </span>that this is the sequence followed? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">communal offerings. However, in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> individual offerin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> brought to fulfill a vow or an obligation, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>a single priest <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes to sacrifice </span>it alone <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrifice </span>it alone, or if he chooses he may include other priests in the service. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the flaying and the cutting of </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">these, </span>individual offerings, and <span class="gemarra-regular">those, </span>communal offerings, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are equal, </span>as will be explained in the Gemara.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught</span> in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: The individual offerings and communal offerings are <span class="gemarra-regular">equal </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">their flaying and cutting, </span>in that these may be performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">non-priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> They are not considered services that require priests. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥizkiya said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: From where </span>is it derived that they are <span class="gemarra-regular">equal </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">their flaying and cutting? </span>From where is it derived that flaying and cutting of offerings, whether individual or communal, may be performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by a non-priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> At first it is stated with regard to the burnt-offering: “And he shall flay the burnt-offering and cut it into its pieces” (Leviticus 1:6), and following that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: “The sons of Aaron the priest shall place fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the altar” </span>(Leviticus 1:7). The fact that the sons of Aaron are mentioned in the verse about putting fire on the altar but not in the verse about flaying and cutting teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">placing fire </span>on the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">requires priesthood, </span>i.e., it must be performed by priests, but <span class="gemarra-regular">flaying and cutting do not require priesthood. </span>

Daf 27a

The Gemara asks: But <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>verse about putting fire on the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">is needed for its own sake</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> to teach that the wood must be brought by a priest; it should not be interpreted as an inference that other services, such as flaying and cutting, may be performed by non-priests. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: I found Abaye explaining </span>Hizkiya’s derivation <span class="gemarra-regular">to his son </span>based on the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. It is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall slaughter </span>the bull before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:5), with no mention of a priest, which teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter by a non-priest is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> acceptable. </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, from where would you come</span> to think otherwise? Why would one even suspect that a priest should be required to slaughter the offering, so that a specific verse is required to tell us otherwise? <span class="gemarra-regular">From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the fact that it is stated: “And you and your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sons with you shall keep your priesthood” </span>(Numbers 18:7), <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>that no part of the sacrificial service may be performed by a non-priest, not <span class="gemarra-regular">even slaughtering. </span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall slaughter the bull before the Lord, and the sons</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Aaron…shall sacrifice the blood” </span>(Leviticus 1:5), from which it is inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span>sacrificing of blood, which begins with the <span class="gemarra-regular">collection </span>of the blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">and onward</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a mitzva </span>exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">of priesthood. </span>Just prior to this the Torah states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall place his hands</span> upon the head of the burnt-offering…<span class="gemarra-regular">and he shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> slaughte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> the bull before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:4–5). In this verse the Torah is referring to the donor of the offering when it says: He shall place his hands, and therefore when it continues: And he shall slaughter, it is also referring to the donor. The Torah thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the slaughter </span>of the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">is acceptable </span>if performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by a non-priest. </span>
Abaye asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since, </span>as this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> establishes, <span class="gemarra-regular">from the collection </span>of the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">and onward</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a mitzva </span>exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">of priesthood, why do I </span>need the Torah to say afterward: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The sons of Aaron </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall put </span>fire on the altar” (Leviticus 1:7)? Since the verse about putting the fire on the altar follows the verse about collection of blood, it is clear that it must be done by priests, and the verse’s stipulation of this fact appears superfluous. This is why Ḥizkiya concluded that the verse is not required for its own sake but is needed to teach the following inference: It is only the placing of fire on the altar that requires priests, <span class="gemarra-regular">to the exclusion of flaying and cutting up </span>the animal, which may be performed by a non-priest.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But still, </span>the verse about the placement of wood by priests <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>for its own sake. As <span class="gemarra-regular">it might have entered your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>placing the wood is <span class="gemarra-regular">not a service that is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">indispensable </span>for obtaining <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement, </span>as atonement is achieved solely through the blood of the offering, it should <span class="gemarra-regular">not be required </span>to be performed by <span class="gemarra-regular">priests. </span>And one might have thought that the principle that all tasks from the collection of the blood and onward require a priest applies only to services relating to the blood. Therefore, the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">priesthood is required. </span>Consequently, it cannot be asserted that the verse is written for the purpose of excluding other services. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Hizkiya’s derivation must be rejected, and the acceptability of non-priests for flaying and cutting the animal must be learned <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: </span>It is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Aaron’s sons, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> priests, shall lay out the pieces, the head and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fat” </span>(Leviticus 1:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">Since, </span>as the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> above establishes, <span class="gemarra-regular">from the collection </span>of the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">and onward is a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mitzva </span>exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">of priesthood, why do I </span>need the verse to specify: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span>Aaron’s sons <span class="gemarra-regular">shall lay out </span>the pieces”? Since the specification of priesthood here appears superfluous, one must conclude that it is written not for its own sake but <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude flaying and cutting up </span>the animal, to teach that those acts need not be performed by a priest.
The Gemara asks: Granted, the verse comes to convey the inference that another act does not require priesthood, <span class="gemarra-regular">but say </span>that it comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the arrangement of the two logs, </span>to teach that this activity may be done by a non-priest. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">reasonable </span>that the verse, which deals with laying out the pieces of the offering on the altar, would <span class="gemarra-regular">exclude a service </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> itself, </span>i.e., something related to the body of the sacrificial animal, such as flaying it and cutting it up, rather than the arrangement of the wood, which is not related to the animal itself.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, </span>one should say that <span class="gemarra-regular">it excludes </span>something relevant to <span class="gemarra-regular">arrangement, </span>i.e., the placement of the logs, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is similar </span>to the laying of the pieces of the offering in that both pertain to the placement of an item on the altar. Perhaps, then, the verse is coming to convey the inference that the arrangement of the logs, unlike the arrangement of the pieces of the offering, may be performed by a non-priest. 
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">It cannot enter your mind </span>to say this, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Master said: </span>After mentioning the mitzva to collect the blood, the Torah states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the priest shall bring </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all of it near and burn it on the altar” </span>(Leviticus 1:13), where bringing near is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> limbs to the ramp. </span>The specification of priesthood in this verse is not required for its own sake, since all services following the collection of blood require priesthood. Therefore, it must be that it comes to convey the inference that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying the limbs to the ramp that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> requires priesthood, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying woo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not require priesthood. This, </span>in turn, implies that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>actual <span class="gemarra-regular">arrangement of the two logs, </span>which was not excluded, <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">require priesthood.</span>
The Gemara returns to the derivation presented above, where the question was raised: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“and </span>Aaron’s sons <span class="gemarra-regular">shall lay out </span>the pieces”? The conclusion was that the specification of priesthood here comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span><span class="gemarra-regular">flaying and cutting up </span>the animal, to teach that these acts may be performed by a non-priest. The Gemara now rejects this derivation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But say that this </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">too </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">for its own sake</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> to teach the lesson that the Gemara will shortly derive from these words (Maharsha), and one can no longer assert that the verse comes solely for the purpose of conveying the inference that other, similar acts, i.e., flaying and cutting up the animal, do not require priesthood.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this derivation must be rejected as well, and another verse must be found from which to prove that non-priests may flay and cut up the animal. The Torah states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the priest shall burn all of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it on the altar” </span>(Leviticus 1:9). Since this is an act following the collection of the blood, the specification of priesthood is not needed for its own sake. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">for what </span>purpose does that verse <span class="gemarra-regular">come? </span>It comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exclude flaying and cutting up </span>the animal, which may be performed by a non-priest.
The Gemara reviews the lessons taught by the other verses cited above. When the Torah writes: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The priest </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall bring all of it near…the altar” </span>(Leviticus 1:13), <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying the limbs to the ramp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and the verse comes to exclude other, similar actions, teaching that although <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying the limbs to the ramp requires priesthood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, carrying wood </span>to the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">does not require priesthood. Therefore</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is derived from here as well that the <span class="gemarra-regular">arrangement</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the two logs does require priesthood, </span>as explained above. And when the Torah writes: “The sons of Aaron <span class="gemarra-regular">shall put </span>fire on the altar” (Leviticus 1:7), this is necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">for its own sake, </span>to teach that this service must be done by priests. 
When the Torah states: “And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall lay out the pieces, the head and the fat” (Leviticus 1:8), it comes to teach the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall lay out,” </span>through the use of the plural, teaches that it must be done by <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>priests, as the minimum number implied by a plural word is two. <span class="gemarra-regular">“The sons of Aaron,” </span>also in plural, indicates an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">two; “the priests,” </span>also in plural, indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>more. <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>from this verse <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the sacrificial <span class="gemarra-regular">lamb </span><span class="gemarra-regular">requires six </span>priests to carry its limbs to the altar.The flesh is taken by five priests, and the innards by one, as described in an earlier mishna.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Hamnuna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar posed a difficulty: This </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>about a young bull, not a lamb; and a <span class="gemarra-regular">bull requires twenty-four </span>priests. How, then, can this verse be used as the source that six priests are required to carry the limbs of a lamb? And <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">resolved </span>the difficulty himself as follows: The same verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“On the wood that is on the fire upon the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> altar” </span>(Leviticus 1:8), all of which apparently teaches nothing new about the sacrifice. Therefore, it is seen as an allusion to the daily offering, which was a lamb, as <span class="gemarra-regular">what is an item about which it is stated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>specially prepared <span class="gemarra-regular">wood and fire </span>on an <span class="gemarra-regular">altar </span>must be provided, and that pre-existing wood and fire do not suffice? 

Daf 27b

<span class="gemarra-regular">You must say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the lamb </span>of the morning daily offering, concerning which the Torah commands that a new woodpile be prepared every day and that the altar must be lit anew each morning. Therefore, although the verse is ostensibly speaking of a bull, it also alludes to the lamb of the daily offering and to the fact that it should be brought by six priests.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">A non-priest who set up the arrangement of woo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> on the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>to receive the death penalty by God’s hand for having performed an act that is restricted to priests, and the woodpile that he placed is invalid. <span class="gemarra-regular">What should he do </span>to repair the woodpile? <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">dismantle it and then rearrange it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara is surprised at this: <span class="gemarra-regular">What good would this do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>the woodpile? How would it help for the non-priest himself to rearrange the wood? It would be just as invalid as it was the first time. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>one must say that the <span class="gemarra-regular">non-priest </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">dismantle </span>it, as there is nothing wrong with a non-priest dismantling the woodpile, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a priest </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">rearranges it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Zeira strongly objects </span>to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s teaching: <span class="gemarra-regular">And do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you have any service that is valid if performed at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">night and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">is invalid </span>if performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by a non-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">priest? </span>A bona fide Temple service must be performed during the day. That the wood on the altar may be arranged while it is still nighttime shows that it is not a bona fide service, and therefore it should be permitted for non-priests to perform it. 
The Gemara expresses wonder at Rabbi Zeira’s equation of the two issues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is there really <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>such thing as a service that may be performed at night but which is prohibited for a non-priest to perform? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t there </span>the burning <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the limbs and the fats </span>of offerings on the altar, which continues throughout the night, and yet it was taught earlier in this chapter that a non-priest who participates in that service incurs the death penalty? The Gemara rejects this objection: The burning of sacrificial limbs and fats, though it may be done at night, is not considered a nighttime service but <span class="gemarra-regular">the end of the daytime service, </span>as it is merely the culmination of the sacrificial service that began during the day.
The Gemara asks further: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the removal of the ashe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> from the altar, which may be performed at night, and yet may not be done by a non-priest? The Gemara rejects this too: The removal of ashes is also not considered a nighttime service but <span class="gemarra-regular">the start of the daytime service</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> And the proof for this is <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Asi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan said: </span>If a priest has <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctified his hands </span>at night by washing them <span class="gemarra-regular">for the removal of the ashes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the next day, </span>i.e., after daybreak, <span class="gemarra-regular">he need not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sanctify </span>his hands again, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he already sanctified </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the start of the service. </span>Rabbi Zeira’s equation between services performed at night and services that may be performed by non-priests therefore remains intact. <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>the objection that he raised to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan remains <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement must be revised, and one must posit that <span class="gemarra-regular">when it was stated, this is how it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was stated. Rabbi Asi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> non-priest who arranges the two logs </span>on the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>to receive the death penalty by God’s hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it is a daytime service. Rava strongly objects</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to this: But if </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">so, </span>if arranging the two logs is a bona fide daytime service and is prohibited to non-priests on pain of death, it <span class="gemarra-regular">should require a lottery; </span>and yet in practice this service is not assigned by a lottery. The Gemara comments that <span class="gemarra-regular">it must have escaped </span>Rava’s mind <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>explicitly in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The priest <span class="gemarra-regular">who was privileged</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>perform the <span class="gemarra-regular">removal of the ashes was </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">privileged</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with setting up the arrangement of wood </span>on the altar and with placing the <span class="gemarra-regular">two logs. </span>
Another difficulty is raised with regard to Rava’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say that a daytime service </span><span class="gemarra-regular">requires a lottery </span>and, conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">a nighttime service does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> require a lottery? Isn’t there </span>the burning of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> limbs and the fats </span>on the altar, which is done at night and yet is assigned through a lottery? The Gemara responds: That is not difficult, since the burning of the limbs and the fats <span class="gemarra-regular">is the end of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> daytime service, </span>as explained above. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t there the removal of the ashes </span>from the altar, which is a nighttime service and yet requires a lottery? The Gemara answers: Indeed, a lottery should not have been required for that service, but one was instituted <span class="gemarra-regular">due to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the incident that occurred, </span>when the priests came to danger, as related in the mishna.
The Gemara asks further: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that to say that </span>any service that is a <span class="gemarra-regular">daytime</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> service and </span>for which <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-priest </span>would be <span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span> to receive <span class="gemarra-regular">the death penalty requires a lottery, </span>and conversely, a daytime service for which <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-priest </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span> be <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to receive <span class="gemarra-regular">the death penalty does not require</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a lottery? But isn’t there </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtering </span>of the daily offering, which may be performed by a non-priest and yet requires a lottery? The Gemara rejects this point: <span class="gemarra-regular">Slaughtering is different, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">it is the beginning of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> service </span>of the daily offering and is therefore considered important enough to warrant a lottery.
The Gemara asks with regard to the revised version of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and some say Rav Ashi, said: But didn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learn </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not so </span>that arranging the logs must be done during the day, as it was taught in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The appointed </span>priest <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Go out and see if the time for slaughtering has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">arrived. </span>The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">does not teach </span>that the appointee said: Go and see if <span class="gemarra-regular">the time for </span>arranging <span class="gemarra-regular">the two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">logs </span>has arrived. This shows that the logs need not be placed after daybreak but may be arranged while it is still night. 
The Gemara rejects this argument: The reason the mishna mentions slaughtering is that it prefers to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>this statement with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which has no rectification </span>if it is done at night, such as slaughtering the offering, which is rendered irreparably invalid if done before daybreak. <span class="gemarra-regular">It does not </span>want to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach something that has rectification </span>if done at night, such as arranging the two logs, which can always be removed and replaced properly. However, the proper time for arranging the logs is indeed daytime.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>a different version of Rabbi Zeira’s objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira strongly objects to </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that a non-priest who arranged the woodpile incurs the death penalty: <span class="gemarra-regular">And do you have any service that is </span>not complete on its own but is <span class="gemarra-regular">followed by a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">different service, </span>such as the arrangement of the two logs, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet is <span class="gemarra-regular">invalid </span>and is punishable by death if performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by a non-priest? </span>It was taught earlier in the chapter that a non-priest incurs the death penalty only for performing a service that is complete, i.e., a service that is not followed by other services that complete the task being performed. 

Daf 28a

The Gemara expresses wonder at Rabbi Zeira’s equation of these two issues: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t there </span>the burning of <span class="gemarra-regular">the limbs and the fats</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The Gemara answers: That is not difficult, because the burning of the limbs and the fats <span class="gemarra-regular">is the end of the daytime service. </span>The Gemara asks further: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t there the removal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the ashes? </span>The Gemara rejects that argument: Removing the ashes is <span class="gemarra-regular">the start of the daytime service, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan said: </span>If a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctified his hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> at night by washing them <span class="gemarra-regular">for the removal of the ashes, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the next day, </span>i.e., after daybreak, <span class="gemarra-regular">he need not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sanctify </span>his hands again, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he already sanctified </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the start of the service. </span>Rabbi Zeira’s equation between services that are incomplete by themselves and services for which a non-priest does not incur the death penalty therefore remains intact. <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>the question that he asked concerning Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement remains <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement must be revised, and one must posit that <span class="gemarra-regular">when it was stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, this is how it was stated: Rabbi Asi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A non-priest who arranges the two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> logs is liable </span>to receive the death penalty, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is a service that is complete, </span>i.e., it is not followed and completed by a subsequent service. Although the burning of the limbs upon the altar follows the placement of the logs, that is considered to be an independent act, not the completion of the service of placing the logs. This is because the placing of the logs is done while still night, while the burning of the limbs cannot be done until daybreak. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> strongly objects to this: However, if </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">so, </span>the service of placing the two logs <span class="gemarra-regular">should require a lottery</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara expresses surprise at Rava’s comment: <span class="gemarra-regular">And doesn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t it require a lottery? Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whoever was privileged </span>to perform the <span class="gemarra-regular">removal of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the ashes </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">also privileged </span>to perform the <span class="gemarra-regular">arrangement of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the two logs? </span>There was in fact a lottery for arranging the two logs.
Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>Rava actually <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>If placing the logs is considered a complete service and is therefore a task important enough to warrant the death penalty for a non-priest who performs it, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">hold a </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">lottery for it by itself. </span>The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we sai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> at the beginning of the chapter, that the task of placing the logs was added to the lottery for the removal of ashes as an incentive for the priests to rise before dawn (Rabbeinu Ḥananel). 
Based on Rava’s comments, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say that </span>any service that is <span class="gemarra-regular">a complete service and </span>for which <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">non-priest </span>would be <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to receive <span class="gemarra-regular">the death penalty </span><span class="gemarra-regular">requires a lottery, </span>but if <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-priest </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to receive <span class="gemarra-regular">the death penalty it would not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">require a lottery? But isn’t there slaughtering, </span>which may be performed by non-priest and yet requires a lottery? The Gemara rejects this point: <span class="gemarra-regular">Slaughtering is different, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the beginning of the daytime service, </span>which gives it added importance.
The Gemara asks further on Rava’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to sa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that a service that is complete</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> requires a lottery, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">a service which is followed by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span>subsequent <span class="gemarra-regular">service </span>that completes it <span class="gemarra-regular">does not require a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lottery? But isn’t there </span>the burning of <span class="gemarra-regular">the limbs</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the fats? </span>The Gemara answers: That is not difficult because the burning of the limbs and the fats <span class="gemarra-regular">is the end of the daytime service. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t there the removal of the ashes? </span>The Gemara answers: A lottery was established for that service only <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the incident that occurred </span>when the priests came to danger.
As explained above, the reason Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that the arrangement of the logs is a complete service, and is not considered a prelude to the burning of limbs, is because the former is a nighttime service and the latter is a daytime service. <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra, and some say Rav Ashi, said: We too</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have learned </span>in a mishna that the arrangement of the two logs is a nighttime service. As we learned: <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> appointed </span>priest <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Go out and see if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the time for slaughtering has arrived, whereas </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not teach: </span>See whether <span class="gemarra-regular">the time for arranging the two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> logs </span>has arrived. This shows that arranging the logs may be done while it is still night; it is therefore not considered to be connected to, and complemented by, the placing of the limbs the following day. 
The Gemara rejects this proof: The reason the mishna mentions slaughtering is that it prefers to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>this statement with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which has no rectification </span>if it is done at night, such as slaughtering the offering, which is rendered irreparably invalid if performed before daybreak. <span class="gemarra-regular">It does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>want to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>it with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">something that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has rectification </span>if done at night, such as arranging the two logs, which can always be removed and replaced properly. However, it is possible that the proper time for arranging the logs is daytime, and therefore it may be regarded as a service that is completed by the subsequent burning of limbs on the altar.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">appointed </span>priest <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the other priests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go out and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> observe if </span>it is day and <span class="gemarra-regular">the time for slaughter</span> has <span class="gemarra-regular">arrived</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If </span>the time has <span class="gemarra-regular">arrived, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">observer says: There is light [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">barkai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Matya ben Shmuel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that the appointed priest phrased his question differently: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the entire eastern sky illuminated even to Hebron</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And</span> the observer <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Yes. And why did they need to</span> ascertain whether or not it is day, which is typically evident to all? It was necessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">as once, the light</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the moon rose, and they imagined that the eastern</span> sky <span class="gemarra-regular">was illuminated </span>with sunlight, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they slaughtered the daily</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> offering </span>before its appropriate time. The animal was later <span class="gemarra-regular">taken</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out to the place </span>designated for <span class="gemarra-regular">burning </span>and burned because it was slaughtered too early. In order to prevent similar errors in the future, the Sages instituted that they would carefully assess the situation until they were certain that it was day. 
After the priests announced the start of the day, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">led the High Priest down to the Hall of Immersion. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">This was the principle in the Temple: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Anyone who covers his legs, </span>a euphemism for defecating, <span class="gemarra-regular">requires </span><span class="gemarra-regular">immersion </span>afterward; <span class="gemarra-regular">and anyone who urinate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> requires sanctification of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hands and feet </span>with water from the basin afterward. 

Daf 28b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the Sages disputed the precise expression that was employed in the Temple. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael says </span>that the formula is: <span class="gemarra-regular">The light</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> flashed; Rabbi Akiva says: The light has risen, </span>which is brighter than a mere flash. <span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥuma ben Apakshiyon says: </span>There is <span class="gemarra-regular">even light in Hebron. Matya ben Shmuel says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the appointed </span>priest in charge of <span class="gemarra-regular">the lotteries says: The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> entire eastern sky is illuminated </span>all the way <span class="gemarra-regular">to Hebron</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says </span>that this is what the appointed priest said: <span class="gemarra-regular">The entire eastern sky is illuminated </span>all the way <span class="gemarra-regular">to Hebron and the entire nation has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gone out, each and every person to </span>engage in <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">labor. </span>
The Gemara questions Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira’s version of the formula: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>that the people have gone to work, it has <span class="gemarra-regular">grown considerably lighter. </span>People go to work after it is light. Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira is referring to a time after sunrise, not a time adjacent to dawn. The Gemara answers: It is that people have gone out <span class="gemarra-regular">to hire workers </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> saying. </span>Owners of fields rose early, adjacent to dawn, to hire workers so that they could begin working when it is light. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Safra said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> The time for the afternoon <span class="gemarra-regular">prayer of Abraha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> begins <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">when the walls </span>begin to <span class="gemarra-regular">blacke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> from shade. When the sun begins to descend from the middle of the sky, producing shadows on the walls, that marks the beginning of the setting of the sun and then the afternoon prayer may be recited. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>And will <span class="gemarra-regular">we arise and derive </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abraham? </span>Didn’t Abraham live before the Torah was given to the Jewish people, and therefore <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> cannot be derived from his conduct? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> derived </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from Abraham’s </span>conduct, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we do not derive</span> a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from his </span>conduct? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> circumcised” </span>(Leviticus 12:3), this verse <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that the entire </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day is suitable for </span>performance of the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumcision</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> However, the vigilant are early </span>in their performance of <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot </span>and circumcise in the morning, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated </span>with regard to the binding of Isaac: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Abraham arose</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> early in the morning and saddled </span>his donkey” (Genesis 22:3). He awakened early to fulfill the mitzva without delay. Apparently, <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is derived from the conduct of Abraham. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef, </span>it was not the matter of deriving <span class="it-text">halakha</span> from the conduct of Abraham that is difficult. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is difficult for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him, as we learned </span>in a mishna: When <span class="gemarra-regular">Passover </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eves occur on Shabbat eves</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the daily afternoon offering is slaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">at six and a half hours </span>of the day <span class="gemarra-regular">and sacrificed </span>on the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">at seven and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">half hours. </span>The afternoon offering was slaughtered as early as possible to enable all the Paschal lambs, which were slaughtered after the daily afternoon offering was sacrificed, to be slaughtered and roasted before sunset, so that no labor would be performed on Shabbat. Now, if indeed this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is derived from the conduct of Abraham, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us slaughter </span>the offering even earlier, <span class="gemarra-regular">from when the walls </span>begin to <span class="gemarra-regular">blacken, </span>just after the end of the sixth hour of the day. Apparently, <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is not derived from the conduct of Abraham. 
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the difficulty? </span><br><span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">walls of the Temple </span>begin to <span class="gemarra-regular">blacken </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">at six and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a half </span>hours of the day <span class="gemarra-regular">because they are not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> perfectly aligned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Temple walls were broad at the bottom and gradually narrowed as they reached the top; therefore, the upper part of the wall did not cast a shadow on the wall opposite it until six and a half hours of the day. <br><span class="gemarra-regular">Or, alternatively, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">different</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Abraham </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">there was great </span>knowledge of <span class="gemarra-regular">astronomy [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">itztagninut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] in his heart. </span>He was able to precisely calculate the movements of the heavenly bodies and was therefore able to discern immediately after noon that the sun had begun its descent. Others require a half hour to be certain that the descent of the sun has begun. <br><span class="gemarra-regular">Or, alternatively </span>Abraham was different <span class="gemarra-regular">because he was an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elder and sat </span>and studied Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">in a yeshiva, </span>where the Divine Presence rests. There he developed the expertise to determine the precise hour. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Ḥama, son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina, said: From the days of our ancestors, yeshiva </span><span class="gemarra-regular">never left them. </span>Our ancestors were leaders of their generations, who taught Torah to students who came to them. 
When <span class="gemarra-regular">they were in Egypt </span>there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a yeshiva </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with them, as it is stated: “Go and gather the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elders of Israel” </span>(Exodus 3:16), indicating that there were Sages among them who studied Torah. And similarly, when <span class="gemarra-regular">they were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the desert, </span>there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a yeshiva with them, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is stated: “Gather for me seventy men from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Elders of Israel” </span>(Numbers 11:16). <span class="gemarra-regular">Abraham our Patriarch </span>was himself <span class="gemarra-regular">an Elder and would sit in yeshiva, as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is stated: “And Abraham was old, advanced in years” </span>(Genesis 24:1). From the apparent redundancy of the terms old and advanced in years, it is derived that old means that he was a wise Elder and prominent in Torah, and advanced in years means that he was elderly. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Isaac</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> our Patriarch was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is stated: “And it came to pass when Isaac</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was old </span>and his eyes were dim” (Genesis 27:1). Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Jacob our Patriarch was an Elder and sat in yeshiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is stated: “And Israel’s eyes were heavy</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with age” </span>(Genesis 48:10). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Eliezer, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">servant of Abraham, was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And Abraham said to his servant, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the elder of his household, who ruled over all he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">had” </span>(Genesis 24:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: </span>The verse means that <span class="gemarra-regular">he had mastery over the Torah of his master, </span>having gained proficiency in all of the Torah of Abraham. That is the meaning of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He is Damascus [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Dammesek</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] Eliezer” </span>(Genesis 15:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: </span>The word <span class="it-text">Dammesek</span> is a contraction of he <span class="gemarra-regular">who draws [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">doleh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] and gives</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> drink [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mashke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to others from his master’s Torah. </span>
Apropos the previous statement, the Gemara cites that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Abraham our Patriarch fulfilled the entire Torah </span>before it was given, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Because [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ekev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] Abraham hearkened to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">My voice and kept </span>My charge, My mitzvot, My statutes and My Torahs” (Genesis 26:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav: And say </span>that the verse means that he fulfilled only the <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>Noahide <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot </span>and not the entire Torah. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t there also circumcision</span> that Abraham clearly observed, which is not one of the Noahide laws? Apparently, Abraham fulfilled more than just those seven. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And say </span>that he fulfilled only <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seven mitzvot and circumcision. </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, why do I </span>need the continuation of the verse, that Abraham kept: <span class="gemarra-regular">My mitzvot and myTorah? </span>That is a clear indication that he fulfilled mitzvot beyond the seven Noahide mitzvot, and apparently fulfilled the entire Torah. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said, and some say Rav Ashi </span>said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abraham our Patriarch fulfilled </span>the entire Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">the joining of cooked foods</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a rabbinic ordinance instituted later, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: MyTorahs. </span>Since the term is in the plural, it indicates that Abraham kept two Torahs; <span class="gemarra-regular">one, the Written Torah, and one, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Oral Torah. </span>In the course of fulfilling the Oral Torah, he fulfilled all the details and parameters included therein. 
§ It was taught in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Matya ben Shmuel says </span>that the appointed priest asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is the entire eastern sky illuminated even to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Hebron? And he says: Yes. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">yes? If we say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">standing on the roof, </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">he dream and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">interpret </span>his dream? Is it reasonable that the one asking the question answers it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>say that it was <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who is standing on the ground </span>who said yes. <span class="gemarra-regular">From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where does he know </span>that the sky is illuminated such that he is able to answer yes? 
The Gemara suggests two possible solutions: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is standing on the ground </span>who answered yes, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you wish, say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who is standing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the roof </span>who answered. <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say that</span> the person <span class="gemarra-regular">who is standing on the roof said: The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> entire eastern sky is illuminated. And that </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> standing on the ground said to him: </span>Has it illuminated <span class="gemarra-regular">even to Hebron? And he </span>who is standing on the roof <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Yes. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the person <span class="gemarra-regular">who is standing on the ground said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Is the entire eastern sky illuminated? And he </span>who is standing on the roof <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Do you mean that it is illuminated even <span class="gemarra-regular">to Hebron? And he </span>who is standing on the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Yes, </span>that is what I mean.
§ The mishna asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why did they need to </span>ascertain <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The mishna answered that there was an incident where they confused the light of the moon with the light of the rising sun and slaughtered the daily morning offering too early. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And are </span>sunlight and moonlight <span class="gemarra-regular">mistaken</span> for one another? <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: A column of </span>the light of the <span class="gemarra-regular">moon is not similar to a column </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the light of the <span class="gemarra-regular">sun; a column of </span>the light of the <span class="gemarra-regular">moon rises like a sta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> in one column while <span class="gemarra-regular">a column of </span>the light of the <span class="gemarra-regular">sun diffuses to here and to there? </span>The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">was a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cloudy day, and </span>then even the moonlight <span class="gemarra-regular">diffuses to here </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and to there, </span>which caused them to err and believe that it was the rising sun. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Learn</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from this </span>statement of Rabbi Yishmael that <span class="gemarra-regular">a cloudy day</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>similar to <span class="gemarra-regular">a completely sunny </span>day because the sunlight is further diffused by the clouds. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the </span>practical <span class="gemarra-regular">ramifications </span>of the statement that a cloudy day is similar to a completely sunny day? The Gemara explains: The ramifications are with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to spreading hide</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to dry them. On a cloudy day, wherever the hides are placed they will be exposed to sunlight. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>the ramifications are according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rava taught </span>with regard to <span class="it-text">matza</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woman </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">neither knead </span>dough for <span class="it-text">matz</span><span class="it-text">a</span> for Passover <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span> the light of <span class="gemarra-regular">the sun nor </span>may she prepare the dough <span class="gemarra-regular">with hot water </span>heated <span class="gemarra-regular">in the sun. </span>On a cloudy day, one may not knead the dough anywhere outside since the light of the sun is diffused everywhere. 
Apropos a cloudy day, the Gemara cites that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: The hazy </span>light <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the su</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> through the clouds <span class="gemarra-regular">is more damaging than the</span> light of the <span class="gemarra-regular">sun </span>itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">And your mnemonic </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span> cover of <span class="gemarra-regular">a jar of vinegar: </span>As long as the jar is tightly closed, the odor of the vinegar does not spread and it intensifies. Even the slightest opening in the lid releases an odor more powerful than the odor generated by vinegar that was not sealed in a jar. The same is true with regard to the rays of the sun. With regard to sunlight that is obscured behind clouds, when it escapes through breaks in the clouds it is more powerful than direct sunlight. <span class="gemarra-regular">Dazzling sunlight</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which shines through cracks in the clouds, <span class="gemarra-regular">is more harmful </span>to the eyes <span class="gemarra-regular">than </span>direct <span class="gemarra-regular">sunlight. And your mnemonic is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a drip; </span>water that drips on a person is more bothersome than water in which one completely immerses his body. 

Daf 29a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Thoughts of transgression are worse than </span><span class="gemarra-regular">transgressio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and your mnemonic is the odor of meat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The smell of roasting meat is more appetizing than actually eating the meat. The heat of <span class="gemarra-regular">the end of summer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is more oppressive than the </span>heat of the <span class="gemarra-regular">summer </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and your mnemonic is a heated oven. </span>After an oven has been heated several times in the course of a day, lighting it again, even slightly, will produce powerful heat. So too, at the end of the summer, since everything is hot, the heat is more oppressive. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">A fever in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">winter is more powerful</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than </span>a fever <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">summer, and your mnemonic is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a cold oven. </span>Heating a cold oven requires greater heat than heating a hot oven. A fever that succeeds in raising the body temperature in the winter must be more powerful than a fever that raises the body temperature in the summer. <span class="gemarra-regular">Relearning old </span>material that was known and forgotten <span class="gemarra-regular">is more difficult than learning from new </span>material. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your mnemonic is </span>mixing <span class="gemarra-regular">mortar from mortar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> It is harder to take hardened mortar, crush it, and mix new mortar than it is to simply mix new mortar. 
Apropos moonlight and sunlight discussed previously, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu said: What is the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rationale </span>for the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi that sunlight diffuses and in that sense is dissimilar to moonlight? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “For the leader, about </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the morning hind” </span>(Psalms 22:1); <span class="gemarra-regular">just as the antlers of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a hin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> branch out to here and to there, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>the light of <span class="gemarra-regular">dawn diffuses to here and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to there. </span>
In tractate <span class="it-text">Megilla</span>, the Gemara states that Queen Esther prophetically recited this Psalm in reference to her situation as she was about to come before King Ahasuerus without being summoned. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: Why is Esther likened to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a hind? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">to tell you: Just as </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a hind its womb is narrow and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is desirable to its mate at each and every</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hour like </span>it is at <span class="gemarra-regular">the first hour, so too</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Esther was desirable to Ahasuerus at each and every hour</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like </span>she was at <span class="gemarra-regular">the first hour. Rabbi Asi said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Why was Esther likened to the dawn? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tell you: Just as the dawn is the conclusion of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the entire night, so too, Esther was the conclusion of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all miracles </span>performed for the entire Jewish people. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t there </span>the miracle of <span class="gemarra-regular">Hanukkah, </span>which was performed many years later? The Gemara answers: It is true that additional miracles were performed after the miracle of Purim; however, it is with regard to miracles for which permission <span class="gemarra-regular">was granted to write </span>them in the Bible that <span class="gemarra-regular">we are saying </span>that the miracle of Purim was the last one. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">That</span> works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well according to the one who said: </span>Permission <span class="gemarra-regular">was granted to write </span>the Scroll of <span class="gemarra-regular">Esther </span>in the Bible as a book whose sanctity equals that of the other books of the Bible. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to the one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who said: </span>Permission <span class="gemarra-regular">was not granted to write </span>the Scroll of <span class="gemarra-regular">Esther </span>in the Bible, and its sanctity does not reach the level of the other books of the Bible, <span class="gemarra-regular">what can be said? </span>
The Gemara answers: Actually, Purim was not the conclusion of all miracles performed for the entire Jewish people, and the one who holds that permission was not granted for the Scroll of Esther to be written <span class="gemarra-regular">establishes </span>the analogy between Esther and the hind <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Binyamin bar Yefet </span>said <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Elazar said; as Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Binyamin bar Yefet said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: Why are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the prayers of the righteous likened to a hind? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">to tell you: Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hind, as long as it grows its antlers they </span>continue to <span class="gemarra-regular">branch out; so too, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the righteous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as long as they </span>engage <span class="gemarra-regular">more in prayer their prayer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is heard. </span>
§ The mishna relates that as a result of the confusion, <span class="gemarra-regular">they slaughtered the daily offering </span>before dawn. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>did this incident occur? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">during the rest of the days of the year, is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there no alternative </span>to having the service performed by <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> High Priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The mishna states that after slaughtering the daily offering, they led the High Priest down to the Hall of Immersion. On all the other days of the year, the High Priest need not perform the service and it may be performed by a common priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that this incident occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">on Yom Kippur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> when the service is performed exclusively by the High Priest. However, in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">is there moonlight</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> According to the lunar cycle, the moon never rises in the east adjacent to dawn on Yom Kippur. 
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>The incident occurred during the rest of the year, at which point they instituted that the appointed priest announce the arrival of dawn in the Temple. <span class="gemarra-regular">And on Yom Kippur, when </span>the appointed priest <span class="gemarra-regular">said: The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">light flashed, they </span>immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">led the High Priest down to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Hall of Immersion.</span>
Apropos this fundamental <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">the father of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Avin taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Not only this, </span>that a daily offering slaughtered before dawn is disqualified and burned, <span class="gemarra-regular">did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they say; rather, even </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the pinching</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the </span>neck of <span class="gemarra-regular">a bird and the taking of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the handful of a meal-offering </span>that are performed <span class="gemarra-regular">at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> night, </span>these items must <span class="gemarra-regular">be burned. </span>The Gemara analyzes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, a bird </span>sacrificed as <span class="gemarra-regular">a burnt-offering </span>is disqualified if pinched before dawn; <span class="gemarra-regular">what was, was. </span>The situation can no longer be remedied, and the bird must be burned. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>why should <span class="gemarra-regular">the handful </span>of a meal-offering be burned? 

Daf 29b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Let us restore </span>the handful that was removed from the meal-offering at night, <span class="gemarra-regular">and let </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us again take a handful during the day. </span>Why must the meal-offering be burned? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">He taught </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that he received through tradition, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>explanation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Service vessels, </span>which are sacred, <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrate </span>their contents <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>when those contents are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>placed in the vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span>the appointed <span class="gemarra-regular">time </span>for that service. Once the handful is placed in the sacred vessel, the sanctity of the handful immediately takes effect and the situation can no longer be remedied.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from that which was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the principle: Any </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">that is sacrificed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> during the day is consecrated </span>by being sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">during the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day; and any </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">that is sacrificed at night is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> consecrated </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">at night; and any </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">that is sacrificed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> both during the day and at night is consecrated both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> during the day and at night</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> In any case</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is teaching </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">that is sacrificed during</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the day is consecrated during the day. </span>One learns by inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">During the day, yes, </span>it is consecrated; <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">night, no, </span>it is not consecrated. Apparently, the handful of the meal-offering is not consecrated before dawn, which poses a difficulty to the explanation of Rabbi Avin’s father. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>the inference from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> means that when it is not sacrificed at its appointed time <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not </span>sufficiently <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated to be sacrificed </span>on the altar; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, it is </span>sufficiently <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated to be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira raised an objection </span>to the principle of the father of Rabbi Avin based on what was taught in a mishna: If a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">arranged </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bread </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the vessels </span>of frankincense that accompany the shewbread on the golden table <span class="gemarra-regular">after Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> on Sunday instead of on Shabbat, then even though <span class="gemarra-regular">he burned the </span>frankincense that was in the <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels on Shabbat, </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> That is because the bread was not arranged at its appointed time and therefore will not be arranged on the table for the requisite seven days. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">How shall he proceed </span>to prevent its disqualification? <span class="gemarra-regular">He should </span>not remove it, but rather he should <span class="gemarra-regular">leave </span>the shewbread on the table <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>be removed <span class="gemarra-regular">the following Shabbat, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as even if </span>the bread <span class="gemarra-regular">remained on the table for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">many days, that </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not matter. </span>Then, on the following Shabbat, he arranges and places the shewbread in the appropriate manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to the opinion of the father of Rabbi Avin, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>is this remedy effective? If service vessels consecrate their contents even when those contents are not placed there at the appointed time, once the bread was placed on the table after Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">it is consecrated and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>Rabbi Zeira, <span class="gemarra-regular">who raises the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">objection, raises the objection well. And the father of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Avin is also stating a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Therefore, his opinion cannot be dismissed. At the same time, the contradiction between the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and the mishna must be resolved. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains: </span>A service performed at <span class="gemarra-regular">night </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">premature. </span>If there is a requirement to perform a certain action during the day but one performed it the night before, it is not considered as though he did not perform it at its appointed time, because the day and the night before it are considered a single unit. Therefore, placing the shewbread on the table before dawn disqualifies it. However, a service performed <span class="gemarra-regular">a day </span>earlier is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">premature. </span>Therefore, the table does not consecrate shewbread placed on it a day before Shabbat, and all the more so a week before Shabbat.
If a service performed at night is not considered premature, <span class="gemarra-regular">when Shabbat evening </span>arrives, the arrangement of bread remaining on the table should <span class="gemarra-regular">be consecrated and disqualified </span>when morning comes, because it was arranged at night. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>It is referring to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">one removed </span>the shewbread from the table <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>nightfall on Friday night to prevent consecration and disqualification. <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Zutra, and some say Rav Ashi, said: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say that one did not remove </span>the shewbread <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>nightfall, <span class="gemarra-regular">since he arranged </span>the shewbread <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the procedure dictated by <span class="gemarra-regular">its mitzva </span>as it was not at its appointed time, its legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes as </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">monke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> arranged </span>the shewbread. At dawn, the priest will remove it from the table and replace it in accordance with the procedure dictated by its mitzva. However, with regard to a meal-offering whose handful was placed into a sacred vessel and shewbread that was placed on the table before dawn, they are not considered premature. They are therefore consecrated and disqualified.
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">This was the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">principle in the Temple: </span>Anyone who covers his legs, a euphemism for defecating, must immerse afterward; and anyone who urinates requires sanctification of the hands and feet with water from the basin afterward. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>one who urinates is required to sanctify his <span class="gemarra-regular">feet, due to drops </span>of urine that drip on his feet. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to his <span class="gemarra-regular">hands, what is the reason </span>that he is required to sanctify them? His hands did not come into contact with anything filthy. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said: That is to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that one learns appropriate conduct from this, namely that

Daf 30a

it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to brush </span>the drops of urine from one’s legs so that they cannot be seen. Since one rubs it with his hands, his hands require sanctification as well. The Gemara comments: This <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Ami said: It is prohibited for a man to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> go out with the drops </span>of urine <span class="gemarra-regular">that are on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his legs, because he appears as one whose penis has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> been severed. </span>A man with that condition is incapable of fathering children. People who see urine on his legs might suspect that he is suffering from that condition <span class="gemarra-regular">and spread</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rumors about his children that they are </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mamzerim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Therefore, one must be certain to brush the drops of urine from his legs. 
Apropos the above discussion the Gemara cites that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> For one with <span class="gemarra-regular">excrement in its place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in the anus, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prohibited to recite </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shema</span> until he removes it. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are the circumstances? If </span>it is excrement <span class="gemarra-regular">that is visible, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that he cannot recite <span class="it-text">Shema</span>, as there is excrement on his skin. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is excrement <span class="gemarra-regular">that is not visible, </span>and it is inside his body, how can Rav Pappa rule that he may not recite <span class="it-text">Shema</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">The Torah was not given to the ministering angels, </span>and one’s body cannot be totally free of excrement. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to prohibit the recitation of <span class="it-text">Shema</span> only in a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is sitting it is visible, </span>and when <span class="gemarra-regular">he is standing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is not visible. </span>
The Gemara asks: If so, in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">different from excrement on his flesh? As it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>in a case where one has <span class="gemarra-regular">excrement on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his flesh or that his hands were </span>placed <span class="gemarra-regular">into a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bathroom </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: </span>It is nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">recite </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shema</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And Rav Ḥisd</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> recite </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shema</span> in those cases. The Gemara rejects this: The situations are not comparable. There is no dispute that excrement <span class="gemarra-regular">in its place </span>is more severe, as in the anus <span class="gemarra-regular">the filth is great </span>because it is new and malodorous. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in its place, its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">filth is not great, </span>as it is dried and less malodorous. It is with regard to that situation that there is an amoraic dispute. 
The Gemara proceeds to discuss a related topic. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a mea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">exits </span>a meal <span class="gemarra-regular">to urinate washes one </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">his hands, </span>the one that he used to brush off drops of urine, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enters </span>to resume the meal. If one left, <span class="gemarra-regular">spoke with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> another, and lingered </span>outside, he <span class="gemarra-regular">washes both of his hands</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and enters </span>to resume the meal. Presumably, during the lengthy conversation he was distracted from maintaining the cleanliness of his hands, requiring him to wash his hands again. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one washes </span>his hands for the meal he should <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wash </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">outside and then enter, due to </span>the concern that doing so will arouse <span class="gemarra-regular">suspicion </span>that he did not wash his hands. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, he enters and sits in his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> place and washes both his hands, and returns the ju</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> of water <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>pass among <span class="gemarra-regular">the guests </span>and ask if anyone requires water, to make certain that everyone is aware that he washed his hands. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: We said </span>this principle with regard to making certain that one washes his hands in public <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>when he enters <span class="gemarra-regular">to drink; however, </span>if he enters and intends <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat </span>he may even <span class="gemarra-regular">wash </span>his hands <span class="gemarra-regular">outside and enter. </span>Why is this so? It is because <span class="gemarra-regular">it is well known that he is fastidious </span>and would not handle food without cleaning urine and the like off his hands. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: And I </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>wash my hands outside when I intend only <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> drink, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">they know that I am fastidious </span>and that I certainly washed my hands before I entered to eat. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A person does not enter the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard for the</span> Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if he is <span class="gemarra-regular">pure, until </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">immerses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Five </span><span class="gemarra-regular">immersion</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and ten sanctifications </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">High</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Priest immerses and sanctifies </span>his hands and feet, respectively, <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the day </span>of Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">And all </span>of these immersions and sanctifications take place <span class="gemarra-regular">in the sacred </span>area, the Temple courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the roof of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Hall of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Parva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, except for this </span>first immersion <span class="gemarra-regular">alone</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> As that immersion is not unique to Yom Kippur, it may be performed outside the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">They spread a sheet of fine </span><span class="gemarra-regular">linen between him and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">peopl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in the interest of modesty, and then the High Priest immersed and <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctified his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hands and feet. </span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">They asked ben Zoma </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this immersion: Why </span>is it a requirement for anyone who enters to perform the Temple service? <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Just as one who moves from </span>service in one <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred </span>area <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>service in another <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred </span>area, i.e., the High Priest on Yom Kippur, who moves from one service to another in the Temple courtyard and the Sanctuary; and likewise one who moves <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>service in <span class="gemarra-regular">an area that </span>one who enters while impure <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">punished by </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>service in another <span class="gemarra-regular">area </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one who enters impure <span class="gemarra-regular">is punished by </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the Sanctuary or the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">requires immersion; </span>so too, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who moves from a non-sacred</span> area <span class="gemarra-regular">to a sacred </span>area, <span class="gemarra-regular">and from a place that</span> one who enters while impure <span class="gemarra-regular">is not punished by </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a place that </span>one who enters while impure <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> punished by </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, is it not right that he require</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> immersion? </span>This first immersion was instituted for purposes of sanctity rather than purity.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda says: It is an ancillary immersion, </span>which is not a mitzva, instituted <span class="gemarra-regular">so that one will remember any old</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> impurity that he </span>contracted <span class="gemarra-regular">and withdraw. </span>In the course of immersion, he will remember if he was exposed to a source of seven-day impurity and will refrain from serving in the Temple. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>ben Zoma and Rabbi Yehuda, who provided two different rationales for the immersion, <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? </span>

It is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>whether the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service is desecrated</span> and disqualified if the priest failed to immerse before its performance that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree. </span>According <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Zoma, </span>this immersion is for the purpose of sanctification and is an integral part of the service; consequently, if the priest failed to immerse <span class="gemarra-regular">he desecrates the service. </span>According <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda he does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">desecrate </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">service, </span>because the immersion is merely a precautionary measure. 
The Gemara wonders: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to ben Zoma, is </span>the service <span class="gemarra-regular">desecrated? But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a High Priest who did not immers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and did not sanctify </span>his hands and feet <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>donning the golden <span class="gemarra-regular">garments and </span>the white linen <span class="gemarra-regular">garments, </span>and similarly, with regard to a High Priest who did not immerse <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>performance of one <span class="gemarra-regular">service and </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">service, his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">service is valid. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">both a High Priest and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">common priest who did not sanctify his hands and feet </span>at all <span class="gemarra-regular">in the morning and performed the service, his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">service is disqualified. </span>If the High Priest’s failure to immerse between services does not desecrate the service, all the more so that failure to perform the first immersion would not desecrate the service, as ben Zoma derives the first immersion from the immersion of the High Priest. Apparently, that is not the basis of their dispute.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> whether one who fails to immerse before service <span class="gemarra-regular">stands in</span> violation of <span class="gemarra-regular">a positive mitzva </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree. </span>According <span class="gemarra-regular">to ben Zoma, he stands in </span>violation of a <span class="gemarra-regular">positive</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mitzva </span>because there is a special requirement to perform this immersion for the purpose of sanctification. According to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he does not stand in </span>violation of <span class="gemarra-regular">a positive </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva. </span>
The Gemara wonders: <span class="gemarra-regular">And does Rabbi Yehuda hold </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning? Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A leper </span>on the eighth day of his purification, after he has already immersed at the end of the seventh day, <span class="gemarra-regular">immerse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> again <span class="gemarra-regular">and stands at the Gate of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Nicano</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> in the Temple to bring his purification offerings and to have the priest sprinkle the blood of the guilt-offering and the oil that accompanies his purification offerings on his thumbs and big toes to complete the purification process. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: He does not require </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">immersion, as he already immersed the </span>previous <span class="gemarra-regular">evening. </span>Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda does not require a special immersion in the morning to remind the leper of old impurity.
The Gemara answers: In <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case of the leper, the reason that no immersion is required in the morning is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the reason was taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he already immersed the </span>previous <span class="gemarra-regular">evening. </span>That immersion purified him and reminded him of any old impurity that he might have. This is in no way connected to the matter of ancillary immersion. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who grasps </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as a contradiction to Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion, in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>manner <span class="gemarra-regular">does he grasp</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The rationale for the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is explicit. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">wants to raise a contradiction</span> between <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> and this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, and the question will be clarified through combination of the sources. As it was taught: Why was the chamber called <span class="gemarra-regular">the Chamber of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Lepers? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the lepers immerse there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">not only leper</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">they said </span>immerse there; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, all people </span>immersed there. Rabbi Yehuda states that lepers and others immersed in this chamber in the Temple, contradicting his statement in the first <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that a leper does not require immersion in the Temple, as he immersed the evening before. 
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult; this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the leper <span class="gemarra-regular">immersed </span>the evening before and need not immerse again; <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the leper <span class="gemarra-regular">did not immerse. </span>In that case, there was a special chamber where lepers could immerse. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the leper <span class="gemarra-regular">did not immerse </span>at all the previous evening, <span class="gemarra-regular">he requires the sun to set </span>after his immersion to be sufficiently purified to enter the Temple. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, both </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> refer to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the leper <span class="gemarra-regular">immersed, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that requires a second immersion is in a case where he <span class="gemarra-regular">was distracted </span>from his efforts to avoid impurity imparted by a corpse; <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that does not require a second immersion is in a case where he <span class="gemarra-regular">was not distracted. </span>
The Gemara asks: If he <span class="gemarra-regular">was distracted </span>from his efforts to avoid impurity imparted by a corpse, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling </span>of purification waters on <span class="gemarra-regular">the third and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seventh </span>days that <span class="gemarra-regular">he requires, </span>not merely immersion. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Dostai bar Matun said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Distraction </span>from efforts to avoid impurity <span class="gemarra-regular">requires sprinkling </span>of purification waters on <span class="gemarra-regular">the third and the seventh </span>days.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, both this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> refer to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the leper <span class="gemarra-regular">was not distracted, and </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult; this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the leper <span class="gemarra-regular">immersed </span>the evening before with <span class="gemarra-regular">the intention </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of entering the Temple; that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the leper <span class="gemarra-regular">did not immerse </span>in the evening with <span class="gemarra-regular">the intention of entering the Temple. </span>In that case, he requires a second immersion for purification even to enter the sacred area. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">Teach</span> the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with a slight emendation: It was <span class="gemarra-regular">not lepers</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">they said </span>immerse there; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, all people </span>immersed there. Rabbi Yehuda does not qualify the statement of the Rabbis but disputes it. In his opinion, lepers do not require immersion in the morning at all. 
In an alternative resolution of the contradiction between the statements of Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>In the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda is stating </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">to them according to the statement of the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>His statement does not reflect his opinion. Rather, it is a contention that he raised in the framework of his dispute with the Rabbis. According <span class="gemarra-regular">to my </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">leper does not require </span>a second <span class="gemarra-regular">immersion </span>to enter the Temple. However, according <span class="gemarra-regular">to your </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">concede to me then [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">izi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">not only lepers </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>immerse there; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, all people </span>immersed there. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how do <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>explain their opinion? It answers that there is no comparison: <span class="gemarra-regular">A leper is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accustomed to impurity; </span>therefore, he could overlook other impurities that he may have contracted. The immersion reminds him to purify himself for those as well. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">people, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">are not accustomed to impurity, </span>will certainly be sensitive to and conscious of any impurity that they may have encountered and do not require a special immersion. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosef: Let us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, who disagree </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>with regard to immersions, <span class="gemarra-regular">hold in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Zoma, </span>who maintains that this immersion is an obligation by Torah law for anyone entering the courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the dispute in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>with regard to a <span class="gemarra-regular">leper, </span>contrary to the opinion of ben Zoma, comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to convey the far-reaching</span> nature of the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> that even a leper does not require immersion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>fundamentally the Rabbis agree with Rabbi Yehuda; however, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">leper is different </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">he is accustomed to impurity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and that is why a second immersion was instituted for him. Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: A leper is different</span> because <span class="gemarra-regular">he is accustomed to impurity. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav Yosef: </span>According to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who said </span>the immersion is not an actual obligation but <span class="gemarra-regular">it is an ancillary immersion </span>to remind the individual of old impurity, 

Daf 31a

do items that are generally considered interpositions that invalidate an immersion <span class="gemarra-regular">interpose</span> in this immersion, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>do they <span class="gemarra-regular">not interpose, </span>since the immersion is only ancillary and serves as a reminder? Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: All </span>ordinances <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Sages instituted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they instituted parallel to Torah law. </span>Therefore, this immersion by rabbinic law has the same basic parameters as immersion by Torah law. There may be no interposition. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav Yosef: </span>Is <span class="gemarra-regular">partial</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> entry</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> when one enters a certain place with only part of his body, <span class="gemarra-regular">considered entry or not? </span>Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: The thumbs </span>of the leper <span class="gemarra-regular">will prove</span> this point, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the leper reaching his thumbs into the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">constitutes partial entry, and it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A leper immerses and stands at the Gate of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Nicanor, </span>indicating that immersion is required before even partial entry. <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>; may an impure person <span class="gemarra-regular">craft </span>a very <span class="gemarra-regular">long knif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and slaughter </span>an animal in the Temple courtyard while remaining outside the courtyard? Is it the essence of the service that requires immersion, or is it entry into the courtyard that requires immersion? 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Raise the dilemma </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to ben Zoma, </span>who rules stringently with regard to immersion; and <span class="gemarra-regular">raise the dilemma </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda </span>and do not obligate all people in this immersion. The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Raise</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the dilemma </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to ben Zoma: </span>Does <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Zoma require</span> immersion <span class="gemarra-regular">only for </span>entry <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the courtyard; <span class="gemarra-regular">however, for </span>standing <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>he does not require immersion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> perhaps </span>even for one standing outside the courtyard ben Zoma requires immersion, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest he </span>inadvertently <span class="gemarra-regular">come to be drawn </span>inside in the course of his service. 
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">raise the dilemma </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Rabbis, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda: </span>How so? Do <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that there is no requirement of immersion <span class="gemarra-regular">only there,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where he is not performing </span>any Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service; however, here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, where he is performing service, no, </span>they would require immersion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps there is no difference, </span>and they would not require immersion under any circumstances. The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span>unresolved. 
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Five immersions and ten sanctifications </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">High </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Priest immerses </span>and sanctifies his hands and feet, respectively. <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Five immersions and ten sanctifications </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest immerses and sanctifies </span>his hands and feet, respectively, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the day </span>of Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">And all </span>of these immersions and sanctifications take place <span class="gemarra-regular">in the sacred </span>area, the Temple courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Hall of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Parva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, except </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>immersion, <span class="gemarra-regular">which was in the non-sacred </span>area <span class="gemarra-regular">on the roof of Gate of the Water, and </span>that gate <span class="gemarra-regular">was alongside his chamber. Abaye said: Conclude from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which was taught in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-italic">Ein Eitam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the spring from which water was supplied to the Temple, was <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-three cubit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> higher than the ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Temple courtyard. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">All the entrances</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that were there </span>in the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">their height is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">twenty cubits and their width is ten cubits, except for </span>the entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Entrance Hall </span>of the Sanctuary, which was twice that, i.e., forty cubits high and twenty cubits wide. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that it is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall wash his flesh in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> water” </span>(Leviticus 15:13), and it is stated in another verse: “And he shall wash all of his flesh in water”(Leviticus 15:16). This refers to water known as <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">waters of a ritual bath. </span>The verse adds the emphasis: <span class="gemarra-regular">All of his flesh, </span>to say that immersion must be <span class="gemarra-regular">in water that one’s entire body enter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> at the same time. <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">is it?</span> It is <span class="gemarra-regular">one cubit </span>length <span class="gemarra-regular">by one cubit </span>width <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a height of three cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> That is sufficient water to cover a person’s height. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Sages calculated</span> that the volume of <span class="gemarra-regular">the waters of a ritual bath</span> that fit into that space is <span class="gemarra-regular">forty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>

Daf 31b

As the gate is twenty cubits high, and the immersion chamber above it is at least three additional cubits high, the water was twenty-three cubits above the ground of the courtyard. The Gemara asks: How could it be only twenty-three cubits higher? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t there the cubit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>the thickness of <span class="gemarra-regular">the ceiling </span>over the gate <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the cubit of the </span>thickness of the <span class="gemarra-regular">plaster </span>sealing of the ritual bath floor for a total of at least twenty-five cubits? The Gemara answers: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Temple gates, since they were </span>constructed <span class="gemarra-regular">of marble, they constructed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them with minimal </span>thickness. Neither the thickness of the ceiling nor the thickness of the plaster was a cubit. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t there that minimal </span>thickness of the ceiling and the plaster that would nevertheless total more than twenty-three cubits? The Gemara answers: Indeed; however, <span class="gemarra-regular">since</span> the ceiling <span class="gemarra-regular">was not </span>a whole <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit he does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> consider it </span>in his calculation. 
§ We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">They spread a sheet </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of fine line</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> between the High Priest and the people in the interest of modesty. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> different </span>that they specifically used a sheet <span class="gemarra-regular">of fine linen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Kahana said </span>with regard to a related issue: <span class="gemarra-regular">So that he will be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> aware that the service of the day </span>of Yom Kippur is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in fine linen garments</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Here, too, </span>a linen sheet was used <span class="gemarra-regular">so that he will be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">aware that the service of the day </span>of Yom Kippur is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in fine linen garments. </span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">removed </span>the white garments that he was wearing, <span class="gemarra-regular">descended </span>to the ritual bath, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">immersed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">He ascended and dried </span><span class="gemarra-regular">himsel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> with a towel. Then <span class="gemarra-regular">they brought him </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">golden garments </span>of the High Priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he dressed </span>in the garments, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sanctified his hands and his feet. They brought him the</span> sheep for <span class="gemarra-regular">the daily </span>morning <span class="gemarra-regular">offering, which he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtere</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> by cutting most of the way through the gullet and the windpipe. <span class="gemarra-regular">And a different </span>priest <span class="gemarra-regular">completed </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his behalf </span>so that the High Priest could receive the blood in a vessel and proceed with the order of the Yom Kippur service. As soon as the slaughter was completed, the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">received the blood </span>in a vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">and sprinkled it </span>on the altar. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">He entered </span>the Sanctuary <span class="gemarra-regular">to burn </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the morning incense and to remove </span>the ashes from <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lamp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of the candelabrum; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he left the Sanctuary and returned to the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">to sacrifice the head and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> limbs </span>of the sheep sacrificed for the daily offering <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>High Priest’s daily <span class="gemarra-regular">griddle-cake </span>offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the wine </span>libation of the daily offering. The Mishna comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The morning incense was burned between </span>the receiving and sprinkling of the <span class="gemarra-regular">blood </span>and the burning <span class="gemarra-regular">of the limbs; </span>and the <span class="gemarra-regular">afternoon </span>incense was burned <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the taking of the <span class="gemarra-regular">limbs </span>up to the altar and the pouring of the <span class="gemarra-regular">libations </span>that accompanied the offering. 
With regard to the immersion, <span class="gemarra-regular">if the High Priest was ol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and found it difficult to immerse in cold water, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>if he was <span class="gemarra-regular">delicate [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">istenis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">heat hot </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">for him </span>on Yom Kippur eve <span class="gemarra-regular">and place </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the cold </span>water of the ritual bath <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">temper its chill </span>so the High Priest could immerse without discomfort. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sages said </span>this matter <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Pappa: This </span>mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, as, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it were in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Meir, since he said: </span>The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">performs two sanctifications </span>of his hands and his feet <span class="gemarra-regular">upon </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">change of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">garments, </span>once before donning the garments and once after donning them, <span class="gemarra-regular">here too, </span>in the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him perform two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sanctifications upon the change of garments. </span>However, the description in the mishna indicates that he removes his garments and does not sanctify his hands and feet. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Both </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis and</span> according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> there is <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>sanctification <span class="gemarra-regular">upon removal </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred garments, and one </span>sanctification <span class="gemarra-regular">upon donning </span>other sacred garments. <span class="gemarra-regular">And here, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to this </span>issue that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree. </span>It is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall remove </span>the linen garments that he put on when he entered the Sanctuary and leave them there. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he shall wash </span>his flesh in water in a sacred place <span class="gemarra-regular">and he shall put on </span>his garments” (Leviticus 16:23–24). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir holds: </span>The Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposes removal </span>of garments <span class="gemarra-regular">to donning </span>of garments for the following reason: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">donning </span>the garments, <span class="gemarra-regular">he dons the garments and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> afterward sanctifies </span>his hands and feet, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">removal </span>of the garments, <span class="gemarra-regular">he removes </span>the garments <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward sanctifies </span>his hands and feet.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis hold </span>that the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">removal </span>of garments <span class="gemarra-regular">to donning </span>of garments for the following reason: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">donning </span>the garments, <span class="gemarra-regular">when he is dressed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he sanctifies </span>his hands and feet; <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">removal </span>of the garments, <span class="gemarra-regular">he sanctifies </span>his hands and feet <span class="gemarra-regular">when he is dressed. </span>Therefore, when he completes the service he sanctifies his hands and feet and only then removes the garments. However, the first time that the High Priest dons the priestly vestments on Yom Kippur he certainly does not require two sanctifications, since at that point he does not remove any other garments. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to Rav Pappa: And how can you say that</span> according to Rabbi Meir the first time that the High Priest dons the garments he does not require two sanctifications? <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as follows? <span class="gemarra-regular">They</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spread a sheet of fine linen between him and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> people, and he removed </span>his garments <span class="gemarra-regular">and descended and immersed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he ascended and dried himself. They brought him golden</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> garments, and he donned </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he sanctified his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hands and his feet. Rabbi Meir says: He removed </span>his garments <span class="gemarra-regular">and sanctified his hands and his feet and descended </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and immersed. He ascended and dried himself. They brought him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">golden garments and he donned </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">and sanctified his hands </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and his feet. </span>Apparently, Rabbi Meir maintains that there is a special sanctification prior to donning the garments. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to them: If it was taught, it was taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> I will retract my opinion, which was based on logical analysis, in favor of an explicit <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that contradicts that opinion. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>according to the approach of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, that is how you find </span>that possibility of

Daf 32a

<span class="gemarra-regular">ten sanctifications, </span>as according to his opinion each of the five immersions is accompanied by two sanctifications. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>who do not require sanctification before donning the garments for the first time, only <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span>sanctifications <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>performed. The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">The Rabbis </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to you: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the final sanctification, when he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> removes </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred garments and dons non-sacred garments, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> performs it there. </span>According to the Rabbis’ opinion, he sanctifies his hands and his feet when he removes the sacred garments. Rabbi Meir holds that sanctification of his hands and feet is performed only before donning sacred garments. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the following with regard to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Aaron</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall come into the Tent of Meeting” </span>(Leviticus 16:23). <span class="gemarra-regular">Why does he come </span>there? He already completed the service in the Sanctuary. <span class="gemarra-regular">He comes only to remove the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">spoon and the coal pan </span>that he left in the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the entire </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">portion </span>in which the Yom Kippur service is discussed <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">order </span>in which it is performed in the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">except for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this verse, </span>which should have been written after the sacrifice of the burnt-offering in the following verse. The High Priest does not remove the spoon immediately after he places it in the Holy of Holies. Rather, after placing it there, he emerges and performs certain services outside the Sanctuary and changes his garments again. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>that the High Priest interrupts the inner rite of the incense to offer his ram and the people’s ram before removing the spoon and the coal pan?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: We </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>as a tradition that <span class="gemarra-regular">five immersion</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and ten sanctifications</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest immerses and sanctifies </span>his hands and feet, respectively, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the day </span>of Yom Kippur; <span class="gemarra-regular">and if </span>the service is performed in <span class="gemarra-regular">the order </span>that appears in the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">you find only three immersions and six sanctifications. </span>The first immersion is before sacrifice of the daily morning offering; the second is between the daily offering and the rest of the service of the day, including the removal of the spoon and the coal pan from the Holy of Holies. The High Priest immerses a third time between removal of the ladle and the coal pan from the Holy of Holies and the sacrifice of his ram and the people’s ram, which were part of the additional offering and the daily afternoon offering that follow.According to the revised sequence, the High Priest performs a service outside the Sanctuary after placing the spoon and the coal pan in the Holy of Holies, and then he reenters the Holy of Holies to remove those vessels. The High Priest immersed and changed his garments both before entering and after exiting the Holy of Holies, for a total of five immersions. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: From where </span>are derived the <span class="gemarra-regular">five immersions and ten</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sanctifications </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest immerses and sanctifies </span>his hands and feet, respectively, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the day </span>of Yom Kippur? They are derived from <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “And Aaron shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> come into the Tent of Meeting and he shall remove</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the linen garments </span>that he put on when he entered the Sanctuary and leave them there. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he shall wash</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his flesh in water in a sacred place and put</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on his garments, and he shall go out and perform</span> his own burnt-offering and the burnt-offering of the people” (Leviticus 16:23–24). From <span class="gemarra-regular">this you learned: Anyone who moves</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>an inner <span class="gemarra-regular">service, </span>in the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>an outer <span class="gemarra-regular">service, </span>and vice versa, <span class="gemarra-regular">requires immersion. </span>According to the order of the services there are a total of five immersions. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: From </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>are derived the <span class="gemarra-regular">five immersions and ten sanctifications </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest immerses and sanctifies </span>his hands and feet, respectively, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the day </span>of Yom Kippur? They are derived from that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is stated: “He shall be dressed in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a sacred linen tunic, and with linen trousers next to his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">flesh, and he shall be girded with a linen belt, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and he shall wear a linen mitre; they are sacred </span><span class="gemarra-regular">garments, and he shall wash his flesh in water and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">then put them on” </span>(Leviticus 16:4). From <span class="gemarra-regular">this you learned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Anyone who moves from </span>an inner <span class="gemarra-regular">service, </span>in the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>an outer <span class="gemarra-regular">service requires immersion. And</span> the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">says: “They are sacred garments”; all of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> garments are equated to one another. </span>Just as the High Priest immerses when donning the linen garments, so he immerses when donning the golden garments. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And they are five services: </span>The sacrifice of the <span class="gemarra-regular">daily </span><span class="gemarra-regular">morning offering, </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in golden garments; the service of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day, </span>the sacrifice of the bull and the goat, which is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in white garments; </span>the sacrifice of <span class="gemarra-regular">his ram</span> guilt-offering and the <span class="gemarra-regular">ram of the people in golden</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> garments. </span>After that he removes the <span class="gemarra-regular">spoon and </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> coal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pan </span>from the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">in white garments</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>He emerges from the Holy of Holies and sacrifices the <span class="gemarra-regular">daily afternoon offering in golden garments</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that each and every</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> immersion requires two sanctification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of the hands and the feet? It is derived from <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">states: </span>“And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting <span class="gemarra-regular">and he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall remove </span>the linen garments that he put on when he entered the Sanctuary and leave them there. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall wash </span>his flesh in water” (Leviticus 16:23–24). And it says: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall wash </span>his flesh in water in a sacred place <span class="gemarra-regular">and put on </span>his garments” (Leviticus 16:24). This indicates that one sanctifies his hands and feet when he removes garments, and one likewise sanctifies his hands and feet when he dons garments. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says </span>that it is derived by means of an <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inference: Just as in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a place where </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">does not require immersion, </span>i.e., for a priest before he enters the Temple to perform service, it nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">requires sanctification </span>of the hands and feet; <span class="gemarra-regular">in a place where </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">requires immersion </span>for all changes of garments, i.e., on Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not right that it requires sanctification </span>of the hands and feet?
<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>based on that inference the suggestion arises: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>in the case of a priest entering to perform the Temple service, only <span class="gemarra-regular">one sanctification </span>is required, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too here, </span>on Yom Kippur, only <span class="gemarra-regular">one sanctification </span>should be required for the changes of garments throughout all the services of the day. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And Aaron shall come into the Tent </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Meeting and he shall remove the linen garments that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he put on” </span>(Leviticus 16:23). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “That he put on”? Does a person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> remove </span>any garments <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>than those <span class="gemarra-regular">that he put on</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rather, </span>this phrase comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to equate removal </span>of garments <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> donning </span>of garments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as donning </span>garments <span class="gemarra-regular">requires sanctification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so too, removal </span>of garments <span class="gemarra-regular">requires sanctification. </span>
The Gemara explains the position of Rabbi Yehuda that was mentioned earlier. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: From where </span>are derived the <span class="gemarra-regular">five immersions and ten sanctifications</span> that the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest immerses and sanctifies </span>his hands and feet, respectively, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the day </span>of Yom Kippur? They are derived from <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “And Aaron shall come</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into the Tent of Meeting </span>and he shall remove the linen garments that he put on when he entered the Sanctuary and leave them there. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he shall wash his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> flesh in water in a sacred place” </span>(Leviticus 16:23–24). From <span class="gemarra-regular">this you learned: Anyone who moves from </span>an inner <span class="gemarra-regular">service, </span>in the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>an outer <span class="gemarra-regular">service, </span>and vice versa, <span class="gemarra-regular">requires immersion. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">We</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> found </span>proof that the High Priest requires immersion when he changes <span class="gemarra-regular">from white garments to golden garments; </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>is it derived that he requires immersion when he changes <span class="gemarra-regular">from golden garments to white garments? </span>

Daf 32b

<span class="gemarra-regular">The school of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael taught </span>that it is derived by means of an <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inference</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Just as </span>before donning <span class="gemarra-regular">golden </span><span class="gemarra-regular">garments, with which </span>the High <span class="gemarra-regular">Priest does not enter the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">innermost sanctum, </span>the Holy of Holies, the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">requires</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> immersion, </span>before donning <span class="gemarra-regular">white garments, with which </span>the High <span class="gemarra-regular">Priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enters the innermost sanctum</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is it not right that</span> the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">require immersion? </span>The Gemara asks: The <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">can be refuted: What </span>is the comparison <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> golden garments, as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>effect <span class="gemarra-regular">is extensive</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The High Priest serves in the golden garments throughout the year atoning for the sins of the Jewish people; he wears the white garments on just one Yom Kippur. Therefore, it is reasonable that before donning them, the High Priest would require immersion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, it is derived </span>from the verse cited by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. 
The Gemara analyzes an additional clause from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited above. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: From where </span>are derived the <span class="gemarra-regular">five</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> immersions and ten sanctifications </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest im-merses and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sanctifies </span>his hands and feet, respectively, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the day </span>of Yom Kippur? They are derived from <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">states</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “He shall be dressed in a sacred linen tunic</span>, and with linen trousers next to his flesh, and he shall be girded with a linen belt, and he shall wear a linen mitre; they are sacred garments, and he shall wash his flesh in water and then put them on” (Leviticus 16:4). From <span class="gemarra-regular">this you learned: Anyone who moves from </span>an inner <span class="gemarra-regular">service, </span>in the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>an outer <span class="gemarra-regular">service, </span>and vice versa, <span class="gemarra-regular">requires immersion. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">We found </span>proof that the High Priest requires immersion when he changes <span class="gemarra-regular">from golden garments to white garments; </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>is it derived that he requires immersion when he changes <span class="gemarra-regular">from white garments to golden garments? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The school </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yishmael taught </span>that it is derived by means of an <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inference: Just as </span>before donning <span class="gemarra-regular">white </span><span class="gemarra-regular">garments, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>effect <span class="gemarra-regular">is minimal </span>as the priest wears them only on one Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">immersion is required, </span>before donning <span class="gemarra-regular">golden garments, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>effect <span class="gemarra-regular">is extensive</span> throughout the year, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not right that immersion </span><span class="gemarra-regular">should be required? </span>
The Gemara asks: The <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">can be refuted: What </span>is the comparison <span class="gemarra-regular">to white garments, as he enters with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them to the innermost sanctum? </span>As the High Priest does not enter the Holy of Holies with the golden garments, apparently the sanctity of the white garments is greater. The Gemara comments: The source for the requirement to immerse when changing from white garments to golden garments <span class="gemarra-regular">is that which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>later in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">They are sacred garments, and he shall wash his flesh </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in water and then put them on” </span>(Leviticus 16:4), meaning immersion is required before donning all sacred garments.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And they are five services: </span>The sacrifice of the <span class="gemarra-regular">daily morning offering, </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in golden garments; the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">service of the day, </span>the bull and the goat, which is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in white garments; </span>the sacrifice of <span class="gemarra-regular">his ram </span>guilt-offering and the <span class="gemarra-regular">ram of the people, </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">golden garments. </span>After that the High Priest places the <span class="gemarra-regular">spoon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the coal pan </span>into the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">white garments. </span>He emerges from the Holy of Holies and sacrifices the <span class="gemarra-regular">daily afternoon offering in golden garments </span>and then removes the spoon and the coal pan in white garments. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that each and every immersion requires two sanctifications </span>of the hands and the feet? It is derived from <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">states: </span>“And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting <span class="gemarra-regular">and he shall remove </span>the linen garments that he put on when he entered the Sanctuary and leave them there. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he shall wash </span>his flesh in water” (Leviticus 16:23–24). And it says: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wash </span>his flesh in water in a sacred place <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">put on </span>his garments” (Leviticus 16:24). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to immersion. </span>The washing mentioned in this verse is not sanctification of the hands and feet but rather immersion. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If it is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a matter </span>relating <span class="gemarra-regular">to immersion, which is derived from </span>the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“They are sacred garments” </span>(Leviticus 16:4), indicating that every change of clothes requires immersion, then <span class="gemarra-regular">render it a matter </span>relating <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let the Merciful One write </span>the obligation <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">language of sanctification </span>of the hands and feet rather than the language of immersion. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>language comes to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach us that </span>in this case, the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">immersion is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctification. Just as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sanctification </span>of the hands and feet is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sacred area, </span>as the basin used for sanctification is situated in the courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">immersion </span>before donning garments must be performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in a sacred area, </span>not outside the Temple. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who derives immersion before donning the golden garments from this verse and does not derive anything from the phrase: They are sacred garments, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where does he </span>derive the obligation to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctification </span>of the hands and feet? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He derives it </span>as an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the inference of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon: </span>In a place that the Torah does not require immersion it nevertheless requires sanctification of the hands and feet; therefore, in a place that the Torah requires immersion for all changes of garments, is it not right that it requires sanctification of the hands and feet? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥisda said: That </span>statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi with regard to immersion and sanctification <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>an original opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exclusion of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir </span>with regard to sanctification, <span class="gemarra-regular">and to the exclusion of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis. It is to the exclusion of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, as the Rabbis said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he sanctifies </span>his hands and feet when <span class="gemarra-regular">he is dressed, and </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: He sanctifies </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">when he undresses. And it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is to the exclusion of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as Rabbi Meir said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this last sanctification</span> that he performs after each immersion, <span class="gemarra-regular">he sanctifies </span>his hands and feet <span class="gemarra-regular">when he is dressed. And </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: He sanctifies </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">when he undresses. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: Everyone agrees with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the second sanctification that one dresses, and afterward sanctifies </span>his hands and feet. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>for this? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the verse states: “Or when they approach </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the altar </span>to serve, to burn an offering by fire to God, they shall wash their hands and feet so that they do not die” (Exodus 30:20–21). This teaches that the priest who is obligated to sanctify his hands and feet is one who is <span class="gemarra-regular">lacking only </span>the element of <span class="gemarra-regular">approach </span>to the altar to begin performing the service, to the <span class="gemarra-regular">exclusion of that </span>priest who has not yet donned the priestly vestments, <span class="gemarra-regular">who is lacking </span>both the element of <span class="gemarra-regular">donning </span>priestly vestments and the element of <span class="gemarra-regular">approach </span>to the altar. Sanctification of the hands and feet prior to the service is performed when he is already dressed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, said to Rav Ashi: Neither</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does Rav Ḥisda, </span>who said that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the priest performs the two sanctifications before donning the garments, <span class="gemarra-regular">agree with Rav Aḥa, </span>who said that that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the sanctification is done after donning the garments; <span class="gemarra-regular">nor does Rav Aḥa, </span>who said that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the sanctification must be performed directly prior to the service, <span class="gemarra-regular">agree with Rav Ḥisda, </span>who said that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the two sanctifications are performed before donning the garments. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>agree, according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">there are fifteen sanctifications. </span>For every each change of garments he would require three sanctifications: One when he undresses, one prior to dressing, and one after he is dressed. 
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">They brought him the </span>sheep for <span class="gemarra-regular">the daily </span>morning <span class="gemarra-regular">offering, which he slaughtered [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">keratzo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-italic">keratzo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Ulla </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: It is a term </span>meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">killing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Naḥman </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Yitzḥak said: What is the verse </span>that indicates this meaning? It is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Egypt is a very fair heifer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">keretz</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out of north is come, it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> come” </span>(Jeremiah 46:20). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>may it be <span class="gemarra-regular">inferred </span>that <span class="it-text">keretz</span> means killing? The Gemara explains: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as translated by Rav Yosef: Egypt is a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fair kingdom, but murderous nations will come upon it from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the north. </span>The Gemara asks: When he <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered </span>the sheep, <span class="gemarra-regular">to what extent </span>did he do so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said: </span>He slaughtered the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a cut through <span class="gemarra-regular">the majority of</span> each of the <span class="gemarra-regular">tw</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> organs, the windpipe and the gullet, which is sufficient to render the animal ritually slaughtered. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan said: With the majority of </span>each of the <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>organs. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Reish Lakish also held: With the majority of</span> each of the <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>organs. This is indeed Reish Lakish’s opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Reish Lakish said: Once we learned </span>in the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of ritual slaughter that <span class="gemarra-regular">the majority of one</span> organ is <span class="gemarra-regular">like the whole, why was </span>it necessary that <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>there that in order for the slaughter to be valid it requires <span class="gemarra-regular">the majority of one </span>organ <span class="gemarra-regular">in a bird and the majority </span>of each of <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span> organs <span class="gemarra-regular">in an animal? </span>That is clear based on the principle that one organ is required in a bird and two in an animal. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">since we learned: They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brought him the </span>sheep for <span class="gemarra-regular">the daily </span>morning <span class="gemarra-regular">offering, which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered </span>by cutting most of the way through the gullet and the windpipe, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a different </span>priest <span class="gemarra-regular">completed </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter on his behalf </span>so that the High Priest could receive the blood in a vessel, and the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">received the blood </span>in a vessel <span class="gemarra-regular">and sprinkled it </span>on the altar; one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that if the other priest <span class="gemarra-regular">did not complete </span>cutting through the two organs, the slaughter <span class="gemarra-regular">would be invalid. </span>
The Gemara asks: How is it possible that one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that if the other priest <span class="gemarra-regular">did not complete </span>cutting through the two organs, the slaughter <span class="gemarra-regular">would be invalid? If </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">so, </span>the completion of the slaughter <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service </span>performed by <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>on Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">All Yom Kippur services are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> valid only </span>if performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the High Priest. The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>Reish Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Clearly, there is no requirement by Torah law to complete the slaughter of the two organs. One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">it would be invalid by rabbinic law; </span>

Daf 33a

<span class="gemarra-regular">therefore, we learned </span>again: <span class="gemarra-regular">The majority </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of one </span>organ <span class="gemarra-regular">in a bird and the majority </span>of each of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>organs <span class="gemarra-regular">in an animal, </span>to teach that slaughtering the majority of each of the signs is sufficient. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And since there is not even an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">invalidation by rabbinic law, why do I </span>need another priest <span class="gemarra-regular">to finish </span>cutting the organs? Why not suffice with the High Priest’s slaughter of the majority of each of the two organs? The Gemara answers: It is nevertheless a <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva to complete </span>the slaughter <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span> to cause the blood to flow more freely. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye arranged the sequence </span>of the daily services in the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">based on traditio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Abba Shaul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> Setting up the<span class="gemarra-regular"> large arrangemen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> of wood on the altar on which the offerings were burned <span class="gemarra-regular">precedes </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> second arrangement </span>of wood. This second arrangement was arranged separately near the southwest corner of the altar, and twice every day priests raked coals from it and placed them on the inner altar in order to burn the <span class="gemarra-regular">incense</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The<span class="gemarra-regular"> second arrangement</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> incense precedes setting up </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> two logs of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wood </span>above the large arrangement to fulfill the mitzva of bringing wood. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> setting up of </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> two logs</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of wood precedes the removal of ashes </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">the inner</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> altar. And the removal of ashes </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">the inner </span><span class="gemarra-regular">altar precedes the removal of ashes from five </span>of the seven <span class="gemarra-regular">lamps </span>of the candelabrum.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">removal of ashes from five lamps precedes </span>the slaughter and the receiving and sprinkling of the <span class="gemarra-regular">blood of the daily </span>morning <span class="gemarra-regular">offering. </span>The sprinkling of the <span class="gemarra-regular">blood of the daily </span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering precedes the removal of ashes from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">lamps </span>of the candelabrum. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the removal of ashes from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">two lamps precedes </span>the burning of the <span class="gemarra-regular">incense. </span>The burning of the <span class="gemarra-regular">incense </span>on the inner altar <span class="gemarra-regular">precedes </span>the burning of the <span class="gemarra-regular">limbs </span>of the daily offering on the outer altar. The burning of the <span class="gemarra-regular">limbs </span>precedes the sacrifice of the <span class="gemarra-regular">meal-offerin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> which accompanies the daily offering. The sacrifice of the <span class="gemarra-regular">meal-offering </span>precedes the sacrifice of the High Priest’s daily <span class="gemarra-regular">griddle-cake </span>offering, half of which he sacrificed in the morning and half in the afternoon. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the griddle-cake </span>offering precedes the pouring of the <span class="gemarra-regular">libations</span> of the daily offering. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">libations </span>precede the sacrifice of the <span class="gemarra-regular">additional offerings </span>on days when the additional offerings are sacrificed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the<span class="gemarra-regular"> additional offerings </span>precede the<span class="gemarra-regular"> vessels </span>of frankincense that are offered on Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels </span>precede the sacrifice of the<span class="gemarra-regular"> daily afternoon offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated: </span>“And he shall lay out the burnt-offering on it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and burn on it the fat parts</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">peace-offerings” </span>(Leviticus 6:5). The term <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it, </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">complete </span>sacrifice of <span class="gemarra-regular">all other offerings</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., after the daily morning offering rather than after the daily afternoon offering. In all cases, the daily afternoon offering is the final offering sacrificed. 
The Gemara proceeds to analyze the items listed by Abaye and seeks biblical or logical sources for each. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said: </span>Setting up <span class="gemarra-regular">the large</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> arrangement </span>of wood on the altar on which the offerings were burned <span class="gemarra-regular">precedes the second arrangement </span>of wood <span class="gemarra-regular">for incense</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>derive this? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: “The burnt-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">itself shall go up</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on its bonfire upon the altar all night” </span>(Leviticus 6:2); <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">large arrangement </span>of wood. <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the fire of the altar shall be kept burning</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on it” </span>(Leviticus 6:2); <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">second arrangement </span>of wood near the corner of the altar, from which coals are taken for the <span class="gemarra-regular">incense. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">I should revers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> them and say that the first verse refers to the arrangement of wood for the incense, and the second verse refers to the large arrangement of wood. The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">reasonable </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">large</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> arrangement </span>of wood takes <span class="gemarra-regular">precedence, as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span> effects <span class="gemarra-regular">is extensive</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> All of the offerings are sacrificed on the large pile, not just the incense.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second arrangement </span>takes <span class="gemarra-regular">precedence, as </span>unlike the large arrangement in which offerings are burned exclusively on the outer altar, coals <span class="gemarra-regular">from it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are taken inside </span>the Sanctuary. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the contention that the <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>effects <span class="gemarra-regular">is extensive</span> takes <span class="gemarra-regular">precedence. And if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one does not find wood for the second arrangement, wouldn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t he take </span>coals <span class="gemarra-regular">from the large arrangement into </span>the Sanctuary to burn the incense? There is no fundamental obligation to bring coals from a special arrangement, and the second arrangement is only an addition to the large arrangement on which all the offerings are burned. 
Abaye continued and said that the <span class="gemarra-regular">second arrangement for incense precedes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the setting up of the two logs. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>derive this? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “And the priest shall burn wood upon it in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the morning, in the morning” </span>(Leviticus 6:5); there is an obligation to place new logs upon the large arrangement. The term <span class="gemarra-regular">upon it </span>underscores that the wood is placed only on the large arrangement, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not on the other </span>arrangement from which coals are taken for the incense. From the fact that this exclusionary term is necessary, it can be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference </span>that there <span class="gemarra-regular">is another </span>pile on the altar, meaning that when the new logs are placed on the altar, the two arrangements are already there. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But this </span>term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Upon it, is needed for its own sake, </span>to teach the obligation to place the logs on the altar; therefore, how can the timing of their placement be derived from that term? The Gemara answers: The term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Upon it, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written twice </span>in that verse: “And the priest shall burn wood upon it in the morning, in the morning, and he shall place the burnt-offering upon it.” From one instance of this term the fundamental obligation to place the logs is derived, and from the other instance the order of their placement is derived. 
Abaye continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">The setting up of the two logs precedes the removal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of ashes </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">the inner altar. Although here, </span>with regard to the two logs, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: In the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">morning, in the morning, </span>meaning that the priest must arise early in the morning to perform this act, <span class="gemarra-regular">and here, </span>with regard to removal of the ashes from the inner altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">written: “In the morning, in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">morning” </span>(Exodus 30:7), <span class="gemarra-regular">even so, </span>an action that <span class="gemarra-regular">facilitates </span>another service takes <span class="gemarra-regular">precedence. </span>Therefore, setting up the logs, from which coals are taken, facilitating the burning of the incense, precedes removal of ashes from the inner altar. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the act that <span class="gemarra-regular">facilitates? </span>It is the placement of the <span class="gemarra-regular">two logs. But didn’t you say</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the two logs go to the large arrangement </span>of wood and not to the arrangement of wood from which the coals are taken for the incense? These logs in no way facilitate the burning of the incense. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The reference is to the <span class="gemarra-regular">category of wood. </span>Although these logs do not facilitate the burning of the incense, wood facilitates its burning, and the two logs are wood. Therefore, they take precedence. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said </span>a different reason: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> began </span>with the service of setting up the <span class="gemarra-regular">arrangement, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> completes it </span>by placing two logs. Only then he moves on to perform a different service. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one does not find wood for the second arrangement, won</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t he take </span>coals <span class="gemarra-regular">from the large arrangement into </span>the Sanctuary to burn the incense? This demonstrates that there are circumstances in which placing the logs facilitates the burning of the incense. Therefore, it takes precedence. 
Abaye continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">And removal of ashes</span> from <span class="gemarra-regular">the inner altar precedes the removal of ashes from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> five </span>of the seven <span class="gemarra-regular">lamps </span>of the candelabrum. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: I learned </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">through</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tradition; </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">I do not know the rationale </span>behind it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava said: </span>The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish said: One may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not forego </span>performance <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>any of <span class="gemarra-regular">the mitzvo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in order to perform another mitzva. 

Daf 33b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And when </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">enters the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sanctuar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the altar </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he encounters first, </span>before reaching the candelabrum; therefore, he performs the service of the altar before removing the ashes from the lamps, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The <span class="gemarra-regular">table </span>stood <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the north </span>of the Sanctuary, <span class="gemarra-regular">removed two and a half </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits from the wall. And </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">candelabrum </span>stood <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sout</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> of the Sanctuary, <span class="gemarra-regular">removed two and a half cubits</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the wall. The altar was centered and standing in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the middle </span>of the Sanctuary, <span class="gemarra-regular">removed a bit outward. </span>Therefore, one encounters the altar first. The Gemara questions the essence of the matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let us stand </span>the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">alongside</span> the table and the candelabrum; why was it removed outward? The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is written: “And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the candelabrum opposite the table” </span>(Exodus 26:35); <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that they are visible to each other. </span>Were the altar aligned with the table and the candelabrum, it would interpose between them. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Conclude from </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Reish Lakish </span>that one may not forego performance of any of the mitzvot, that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to forego </span>donning the phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">of the arm </span>in order to don the <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries </span>of the head, as when donning phylacteries, one encounters the arm first. <span class="gemarra-regular">How does he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> conduct </span>himself? He proceeds <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the phylacteries <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">arm </span>to the <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries </span>of the head. 
§ Abaye continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">And removal of ashes from five </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lamps precedes </span>the slaughter and the receiving and sprinkling of the <span class="gemarra-regular">blood </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the daily </span>morning <span class="gemarra-regular">offering. </span>The sprinkling of <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood of the daily offering precedes the removal of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ashes from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">lamps </span>of the candelabrum. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Take <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">In the morning, in the morning, </span>written with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the two logs, which is unnecessar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> to establish the time for performance of that service, as its precedence was explained due to its association with the arrangement of wood. And <span class="gemarra-regular">cast </span>that extraneous phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">to here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and apply it to other elements of the morning service. If the phrase is superfluous in its context, apply it elsewhere where a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> can be derived. <span class="gemarra-regular">Cast one </span>term: In the morning, and apply it <span class="gemarra-regular">to removal of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ashes from five lamps </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that it </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">precede the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">blood of the daily offering. And cast one </span>term: In the morning, and apply it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the blood of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">daily offering, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that it </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">precede the removal of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ashes from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">lamps. </span>
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Cast one </span>term: In the morning, and apply it <span class="gemarra-regular">to removal of ashes from five lamps </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that it </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">precede the blood of the daily </span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering, as here, </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>instances of: In the morning; two instances are written explicitly with regard to removal of ashes from the lamps (see Exodus 30:7) and one is written with regard to the two logs. <span class="gemarra-regular">And here, </span>with regard to the blood of the daily offering, there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>instances of the phrase; one explicit mention in the text (see Exodus 29:39) and one written with regard to the two logs. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And cast one </span>term: In the morning, <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the blood of the daily offering </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that it </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">precede the removal of ashes from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">lamps</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Although here, </span>with regard to removal of ashes from the lamps, there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>instances of the phrase: In the morning, <span class="gemarra-regular">and here, </span>with regard to the blood of the daily offering, there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>instances of the phrase: In the morning, one written and one cast from the portion of two logs, the blood of the daily offering takes precedence because an act that <span class="gemarra-regular">effects atonement, </span>the sprinkling of blood, takes <span class="gemarra-regular">precedence. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Pappa said to Abaye: And say </span>instead, <span class="gemarra-regular">cast one </span>of the extraneous phrases: In the morning, and apply it <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">removal of ashes </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">the inner altar, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">precede the blood of the daily offering, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>instances of the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">and there</span> there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two. And cast one </span>of the extraneous phrases: In the morning, and apply it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the blood of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the daily offering </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that it </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">precede the removal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of ashes from five lamps, </span>and say that <span class="gemarra-regular">although </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>instances of the phrase: In the morning, <span class="gemarra-regular">and here </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>instances of the phrase: In the morning, still an act that <span class="gemarra-regular">effects atonement, </span>the sprinkling of blood, takes <span class="gemarra-regular">precedence. </span>Abaye dismisses this question by saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the blood of the daily offering precedes the removal of ashes from five lamps, <span class="gemarra-regular">with what will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you demarcate </span>between the removal of ashes from five lamps and the removal of ashes from two lamps? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Why does </span>the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">remove</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the ashes from </span>five lamps of the candelabrum <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">return and remove the ashes from </span>two lamps of the candelabrum rather than arrange all seven lamps at once? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to enliven </span>those present in the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire</span> Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, </span>since people are coming and going to fulfill this mitzva with great ceremony. It works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>according to the opinion of Reish Lakish, because he says there is no need for any other service to demarcate between removal of ashes from five lamps and removal of ashes from two. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan, who said </span>the following based on the verse: “And Aaron shall burn upon it incense of sweet spices; in the morning, in the morning, when he removes the ashes from the lamps” (Exodus 30:7); take the term <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> morning, in the morning, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">divide </span>the service of removal of ashes from the lamps <span class="gemarra-regular">into two mornings, </span>i.e., into two parts, by performing a service in between, <span class="gemarra-regular">what can be said? </span>According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, since the result would be that there is no service demarcating between the five lamps and the two lamps, there is no alternative to interpreting the matter in accordance with the explanation of Abaye.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ashi </span>with regard to the basis for Abaye’s argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this </span>term: <span class="gemarra-regular">In the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">morning, in the morning, </span>written with regard to the two <span class="gemarra-regular">logs </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">superfluous </span>and therefore available to have other matters derived from it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it necessary </span>to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">own </span>basic <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the Merciful One states </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">Have it precede the second arrangement </span>of wood, from which coals are taken <span class="gemarra-regular">for the incense? </span>Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: And did we not establish </span>that it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">Upon it, </span>underscoring the fact that wood is placed only on the large arrangement <span class="gemarra-regular">and not on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> other </span>arrangement from which coals are taken for the incense? From the fact that this exclusionary term is necessary, it can be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference </span>that there <span class="gemarra-regular">is another </span>pile on the altar, meaning that when the new logs are placed on the altar, the two arrangements are already there.
The Gemara asks with regard to the sequence in which the priest removes the ashes from the lamps: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is different that he performs the removal of ashes from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> five lamps first? Let us perform the removal of ashes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from two lamps first. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since he begins</span> the service <span class="gemarra-regular">with them, he performs </span>the service on <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> majority of the </span>lamps. The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him perform </span>the service on <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>lamps. The Gemara responds that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “When he removes the ashes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from the lamps, he shall burn it” </span>(Exodus 30:7), <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lamps is </span>plural, meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">no fewer than two. </span>Apparently, removal of ashes from lamps must be performed on a minimum of two lamps. 
Abaye continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the removal of ashes from two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lamps precedes </span>the burning of the <span class="gemarra-regular">incense, as the verse </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “When he removes the ashes from the lamps,”</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and then </span>states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He shall burn it.” </span>The removal of the ashes precedes the burning of the incense. 
Abaye continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the burning of the <span class="gemarra-regular">incense</span> on the inner altar <span class="gemarra-regular">precedes </span>the burning of the <span class="gemarra-regular">limbs</span> of the daily offering on the outer altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let the matter with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to which it is stated: In the morning, in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> morning, </span>i.e., the burning of the incense, <span class="gemarra-regular">precede the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> matter with regard to which only one: In the morning</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, is stated, </span>i.e., the daily morning offering, in the verse: “You shall offer one lamb in the morning” (Exodus 29:39). 
Abaye continued: The burning of <span class="gemarra-regular">the limbs </span>precedes the sacrifice of the <span class="gemarra-regular">meal-offering </span>that accompanies the daily offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that there </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">be no item </span>placed on the arrangement of wood <span class="gemarra-regular">prior to the daily morning </span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering? </span>

Daf 34a

<span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: </span>“And the priest shall burn wood upon it in the morning, in the morning, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall place the burnt-offering upon it” </span>(Leviticus 6:5), <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rava said: </span>The verse could have simply said: And he shall place upon it, indicating that everything sacrificed on the altar is placed upon it; but instead, the verse states: “And he shall place <span class="gemarra-regular">the burnt-offering </span>upon it,” to teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">it ascends </span>the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">first</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
Abaye continued: The sacrifice of the <span class="gemarra-regular">meal-offering </span>precedes the sacrifice of the High Priest’s daily <span class="gemarra-regular">griddle-cake </span>offering, half of which he sacrifices in the morning and half in the afternoon, as the verse states: “To bring offerings by fire to the Lord, burnt-offerings, meal-offerings, sacrifices, and libations, on each day what is proper to it” (Leviticus 23:37). Since the Torah states <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offerings and meal-offerings, </span>apparently the daily burnt-offering precedes the meal-offering. And since the meal-offering is part of the burnt-offering sacrifice, it precedes the griddle-cake offering, which is a meal-offering unrelated to the burnt-offering. 
Abaye continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the griddle-cake </span>offering precedes the pouring of the <span class="gemarra-regular">libation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of the daily offering. This is because it is in the <span class="gemarra-regular">category </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">meal-offering. </span>Since it has been established that the meal-offering that accompanies the daily offering is sacrificed after the daily offering, all meal-offerings are sacrificed after the daily-offering prior to any other service. 
Abaye continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">libations </span>precede the sacrifice of the <span class="gemarra-regular">additional offerings</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">Offerings and libations</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>from which it is derived that the libations are brought immediately after the daily offering, before any other offering is sacrificed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the additional offerings </span>precede <span class="gemarra-regular">the vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of frankincense that are brought on Shabbat. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The vessels </span>of frankincense <span class="gemarra-regular">precede the additional offerings? </span>The Gemara answers: This <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the subject of a dispute between the <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span> Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva (<span class="it-text">Pesaḥim</span> 58a). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said:</span> It is <span class="gemarra-regular">reasonable </span>that the sequence should be <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who said the additional</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> offerings </span>precede <span class="gemarra-regular">the vessels </span>of frankincense, as <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that the repetition of the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">In the morning</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, in the morning, </span>comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to prioritize </span>the daily offering? <span class="gemarra-regular">Here</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> too, </span>repetition within the clause: “He shall arrange them <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span> Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">day, on </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">day” </span>(Leviticus 24:8), with regard to the vessels of frankincense, comes to <span class="gemarra-regular">postpone </span>that service until the peak of the day. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the rationale </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels </span>of frankincense <span class="gemarra-regular">precede the additional offerings? </span>The Gemara explains: By means of a verbal analogy <span class="gemarra-regular">he derives</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Statute, </span>written with regard to the vessels of frankincense: “A statute for all time” (Leviticus 24:9), <span class="gemarra-regular">from: Statute, </span>written with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">griddle-cake </span>offering: “A statute for all time” (Leviticus 6:15). Just as the griddle-cake offering precedes the additional offerings, so too, the vessels of frankincense precede the additional offerings. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he derived it from there, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">let him derive the entire matter from there, </span>and let the vessels of frankincense be burned immediately after the griddle-cake offering; why are the libations offered between them? The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">to that </span>end that the verse: “He shall arrange them <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">day, on </span>Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>with regard to the vessels of frankincense, <span class="gemarra-regular">is effective,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">postpone</span> their offering until later. 
§ After analyzing Abaye’s tradition with regard to the sequence of the daily service, the Gemara returns to analyzing the passage in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The morning incense was burned</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> between </span>the receiving and sprinkling of the <span class="gemarra-regular">blood </span>and the burning <span class="gemarra-regular">of the limbs. </span>The Gemara asks: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is the mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>elsewhere (15a), the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>say that the incense was burned <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the sprinkling of the <span class="gemarra-regular">blood and </span>the removal of the ashes from the <span class="gemarra-regular">lamps. If </span>it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Shaul, </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>say that the incense was burned <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the removal of the ashes from the <span class="gemarra-regular">lamps and </span>the burning <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">limbs. </span>
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, but </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is not speaking of the sequence </span>of the entire service. The mishna states that the incense was burned between the sprinkling of the blood and the burning of the limbs of the daily offering, although other services were performed then as well, including the removal of ashes from the lamps. 
The mishna continues: The <span class="gemarra-regular">afternoon </span>incense was burned <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the taking of the <span class="gemarra-regular">limbs </span>up to the altar and the pouring of its <span class="gemarra-regular">libations. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters </span>derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: </span>“And the other lamb you shall present in the afternoon, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> meal-offering in the morning and its libation, you shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> present it, </span>an offering made by fire, of a sweet fragrance unto the Lord” (Numbers 28:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the morning meal-offering incense precedes libations, so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> too here, </span>in the afternoon, <span class="gemarra-regular">incense precedes the libations. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>so, <span class="gemarra-regular">just</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as there, </span>in the morning, <span class="gemarra-regular">incense </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">precedes limbs, so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> too here, </span>in the afternoon, <span class="gemarra-regular">incense </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">precede limbs. </span>The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it written: As the limbs in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the morning? As the meal-offering in the morning, is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written, </span>indicating with regard to the daily afternoon offering that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">like the meal-offering in the morning, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and not like the </span>burning of the <span class="gemarra-regular">limbs of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">morning. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And its libation shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be a quarter-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hin</span> for the one lamb, in the sacred area it shall be poured as an offering of strong drink unto the Lord” (Numbers 28:7). The Sages understand this verse as referring to the daily afternoon offering; therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">one will derive </span>the manner and order <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the daily <span class="gemarra-regular">morning </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> the manner and order <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the daily <span class="gemarra-regular">afternoon </span>offering. Just as libations are required for the daily afternoon offering, so too, they are required for the daily morning offering. 

Daf 34b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The daily <span class="gemarra-regular">afternoon </span>offering is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from that of the morning. </span>The phrase: “The one lamb,” refers to the lamb of the daily morning offering, and the daily afternoon offering is derived from it. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis</span> who hold that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>with regard to the daily <span class="gemarra-regular">afternoon </span>offering based on the preceding verses, they can explain that the daily morning offering is derived from the daily afternoon offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, what is the rationale </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that the afternoon offering is derived from the morning offering? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Ulla said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “For the one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lamb.” Which is the lamb with regard to which it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>previously <span class="gemarra-regular">stated: One? You must say: That is </span>the lamb of the <span class="gemarra-regular">daily morning offering </span>(see Exodus 29:39).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, what </span>is the meaning of the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">One? </span>It means the <span class="gemarra-regular">special </span>lamb <span class="gemarra-regular">that is </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">in his flock. </span>The lamb for the daily offering should be of the highest quality. <br><span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>from where does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi derive that principle? The Gemara answers that in his opinion, the principle <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived </span>from that which is written: “And <span class="gemarra-regular">all the choicest of your</span> vow-offerings” (Deuteronomy 12:11). One is required to fulfill his vow by offering the animal of the highest quality. <br><span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how do <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>interpret this verse? They interpret that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>verse refers to the requirement to bring the animal of the highest quality for <span class="gemarra-regular">obligatory </span>offerings and <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span> verse refers to the requirement to bring the animal of the highest quality for gift-offerings. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>both verses are <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary, </span>as otherwise it would not have been clear that this requirement applies to both. On the one hand, one might think it is only with regard to obligatory offerings that the animal of the highest quality must be sacrificed. On the other hand, one might think it is only with regard to a gift-offering that the animal of the highest quality must be sacrificed, as if it is not of the highest quality, it is better not to sacrifice it at all. 
§ The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the High </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Priest was old or delicate, </span>they would heat hot water for him on Yom Kippur eve and place it into the cold water of the ritual bath in order to temper its chill. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: They would heat blocks of iro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yom Kippur eve and cast them into the cold </span>water of the ritual bath <span class="gemarra-regular">to temper its chill. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>by doing so, <span class="gemarra-regular">doesn’t he harden </span>the iron, which is a labor prohibited on Yom Kippur? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Beivai said: </span>The temperature of the blocks of iron <span class="gemarra-regular">did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not reach </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">hardening </span>point. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say that </span>the temperature of the iron <span class="gemarra-regular">reached </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">hardening</span> point, the fact that the iron hardened when he placed it in the water is <span class="gemarra-regular">an unintentional act</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. </span>His intention was to temper the chill of the water, not to harden the iron.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And did Abaye </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say that </span>an unintentional act is permitted? <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that it is written: “And on the eighth day the <span class="gemarra-regular">flesh of his foreskin</span> shall be circumcised<span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Leviticus 12:3), from which it is derived that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">cut </span>the foreskin and circumcise the baby <span class="gemarra-regular">even if there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a white spot </span>of leprosy <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> He may do so even though the Torah prohibits excising a white spot of leprosy. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoshiya. And we discussed </span>this matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">a verse </span>to permit it? His intention is not to excise the leprosy but to fulfill the mitzva of circumcision. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Abaye said: </span>The statement of Rabbi Yoshiya is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that performing <span class="gemarra-regular">an unintentional act is prohibited. </span>Therefore, a special verse is necessary to permit circumcision in that case. Apparently, Abaye holds that Rabbi Yehuda prohibits even unintentional acts. Why, then, does he explain that Rabbi Yehuda permits placing blocks of iron into the water if his intention is not to harden the iron? 
The Gemara answers: When Abaye said that Rabbi Yehuda prohibits unintentional acts, <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> applies only to </span>actions prohibited by Torah law that appear in <span class="gemarra-regular">the whole Torah in its entirety. However, here, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hardening </span>the blocks of iron is not a labor prohibited by Torah law but is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law, </span>as a decree intended to enhance the character of Shabbat as a day of rest. Rabbi Yehuda concedes that unintentional performance of prohibitions by rabbinic law is permitted. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">They</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brought </span>the High Priest to immerse a second time in the <span class="gemarra-regular">Hall of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Parva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">was in the sacred </span>area, the Temple courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">They spread a sheet of fine linen</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> between him and the people </span>in the interest of modesty. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he sanctified his hands and his feet and removed</span> his garments. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says </span>that this was the sequence: He first <span class="gemarra-regular">removed </span>his garments and then <span class="gemarra-regular">he sanctified his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hands and his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">feet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">He descended and immersed </span>a second time. <span class="gemarra-regular">He ascended and dried himself. </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">brought him </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">white </span><span class="gemarra-regular">garments</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in which <span class="gemarra-regular">he dressed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and he sanctified his hands and his feet. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">In the morning he would wear</span> linen garments <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the Egyptian city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Pelusium worth twelve</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">maneh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>1,200 dinars or <span class="it-text">zuz</span>. These garments were very expensive due to their high quality. And <span class="gemarra-regular">in the afternoon </span>he wore linen garments <span class="gemarra-regular">from India</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which were slightly less expensive, <span class="gemarra-regular">worth eight hundred </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zuz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi Meir.

These </span>sums for the garments came <span class="gemarra-regular">from the community, and if </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">wished to add </span>money to purchase even finer garments, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">add </span>funding of his own. 

Daf 35a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of the name <span class="gemarra-italic">Parva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rav Yosef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Parva</span> is the name of a Persian <span class="gemarra-regular">sorcerer,</span> whose name is associated with the chamber due to a particular incident.
§ It was stated in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">They spread </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">a sheet of fine</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> linen. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>that the sheet that they spread was made of <span class="gemarra-regular">fine linen? Rav Kahana</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">will be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> aware </span>and remember <span class="gemarra-regular">that the service of the day </span>is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in fine linen. </span>
§ The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">In the morning, he would wear </span>garments <span class="gemarra-regular">worth eighteen </span><span class="it-text">maneh</span>, and in the afternoon he would wear garments worth twelve <span class="it-text">maneh</span>. In total, the clothes were worth thirty <span class="it-text">maneh</span>. The Gemara expresses surprise at the total in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> come to tell us the tally </span>that eighteen and twelve equal thirty? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>comes to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach us that </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not fashion </span>garments worth <span class="gemarra-regular">less than </span>the total of <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>morning and afternoon garments. The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">If one decreases </span>the value <span class="gemarra-regular">of these </span>morning garments, and <span class="gemarra-regular">raises </span>the value <span class="gemarra-regular">of those </span>afternoon garments, <span class="gemarra-regular">we have no </span>problem <span class="gemarra-regular">with it. </span>One can distribute the total of thirty <span class="it-text">maneh</span> between the two sets of garments in any manner that he chooses. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, everyone, </span>both Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">agrees that </span>the clothes of the <span class="gemarra-regular">morning are superior </span>and must be more valuable than those of the afternoon. <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where do we </span>derive this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ilai, said </span>that with regard to the linen garments donned by the High Priest in the morning, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: </span>“He shall be dressed in a sacred <span class="gemarra-regular">linen </span>tunic, and with <span class="gemarra-regular">linen </span>trousers next to his flesh, and he shall be girded with a <span class="gemarra-regular">linen </span>belt, and he shall wear <span class="gemarra-regular">a line</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> mitre” (Leviticus 16:4). From the fact that the verse repeats the term linen four times it is derived that the <span class="gemarra-regular">choicest linen </span>should be used for this purpose. 

Daf 35b

<span class="gemarra-regular">The Gemara raises an objection. </span>It is stated: “And it shall be that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within” (Ezekiel 44:17). This verse is referring to the Yom Kippur service, as during the year the High Priest performed the service in eight priestly vestments made partially of wool. Two verses later the prophet says: “And when they go forth into the outer court, into the outer court to the people, they shall remove their garments in which they serve, and lay them in the sacred chambers, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they shall put on other garments, so that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they do not sanctify the people with their garments” </span>(Ezekiel 44:19). 
The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, doesn’t “other” </span>mean <span class="gemarra-regular">more </span><span class="gemarra-regular">important than </span>the first set of linen garments? The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>although <span class="gemarra-regular">“other” </span>means different garments, it means garments <span class="gemarra-regular">inferior to them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the first set of linen garments. The High Priest does not don a second set of garments to effect atonement; rather, he dons them in deference to God to remove the spoon and the coal pan from the Holy of Holies.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Huna bar Yehuda, and some say Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, taught: After the public service concluded, a priest whose </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mother had made him </span>a priestly <span class="gemarra-regular">tunic </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">wear it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and perform an individual service </span>while wearing <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> such as removal of the spoon and the coal pan, which is not a service in and of itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">transfers it to </span>the possession of <span class="gemarra-regular">public</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> All services performed by the priest must be performed while he is wearing sacred garments owned by the public, as all the Temple vessels are. The Gemara asks: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious; </span>once he transfers it to the possession of the public, it is Temple property like any other vessel that an individual donates to the Temple. What is novel in this statement? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that the concern is that since he is the one wearing it <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>he will intend to retain ownership <span class="gemarra-regular">and will not transfer it wholeheartedly; </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches us</span> that if he transfers possession to the public, that is not a concern. Apropos this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, the Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">They</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said about </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael ben Pabi that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his mother made him a tunic worth one hundred </span><span class="gemarra-italic">maneh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. He donned it and performed an individual service and transferred</span> possession of it <span class="gemarra-regular">to the public. </span>
And similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">they said about </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar ben Ḥarsu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that his mother made </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him a tunic </span>worth <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty thousand </span>dinars, <span class="gemarra-regular">but his fellow </span><span class="gemarra-regular">priests did not allow him to wear it because </span>it was transparent and <span class="gemarra-regular">he appeared as </span>one who is <span class="gemarra-regular">naked.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And could </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">be seen </span>through a garment made to the specifications of the priestly vestments? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t the Master say: The threads </span>of the priestly vestments <span class="gemarra-regular">were six-fold? </span>Since the clothes were woven from threads that thick, his body could not have been seen through them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: It is like wine in </span>a thick <span class="gemarra-regular">glas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> cup. His flesh could not actually be seen, but since it was very fine linen, it was somewhat translucent and his skin color was discernible. 
§ Apropos the great wealth of Rabbi Elazar ben Ḥarsum, the Gemara cites that which <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught: A poor </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a wealthy </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a wicked </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">come to </span>face <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment </span>before the Heavenly court for their conduct in this world. <span class="gemarra-regular">To the poor </span>person, the members of the court <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Why did you not engage in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If he </span>rationalizes his conduct <span class="gemarra-regular">and says: I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was poor and preoccupied with </span>earning enough to pay for <span class="gemarra-regular">my sustenance </span>and that is why I did not engage in Torah study, <span class="gemarra-regular">they say to him: Were you any </span><span class="gemarra-regular">poorer than Hillel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who was wretchedly poor and nevertheless attempted to study Torah? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">They said about Hillel the Elder that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">each and every day he would work and earn a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">half-dinar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> half of which he would give to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the guard of the study hal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and half of which</span> he spent <span class="gemarra-regular">for his sustenance and the sustenance of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> members of his family. One time he did not find</span> employment <span class="gemarra-regular">to earn </span>a wage, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the guard of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the study hall did not allow him to enter. He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ascended </span>to the roof, <span class="gemarra-regular">suspended </span>himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and sat at the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">edge of the skyligh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in order to hear the words</span> of the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">of the living God from the mouths</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Shemaya and Avtalyon, </span>the spiritual leaders of that generation. 
The Sages continued and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: That day was Shabbat eve and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it was the </span>winter <span class="gemarra-regular">season of Tevet, and snow fell</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon him from the sky. When it was dawn, Shemaya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to Avtalyon: Avtalyon, my brother, every day </span>at this hour <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>study <span class="gemarra-regular">hall </span>is already <span class="gemarra-regular">bright </span>from the sunlight streaming through the skylight, <span class="gemarra-regular">and today it is dark; is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it perhaps a cloudy day? They focused their eyes and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> saw the image of a man in the skylight. They</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ascended and found him </span>covered with <span class="gemarra-regular">snow three cubits high</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> They extricated him </span>from the snow, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they washed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him and smeared </span>oil <span class="gemarra-regular">on him, and they sat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him opposite the bonfire </span>to warm him. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said: This </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">is worthy </span>for us <span class="gemarra-regular">to desecrate Shabbat for him. </span>Saving a life overrides Shabbat in any case; however, this great man is especially deserving. Clearly, poverty is no excuse for the failure to attempt to study Torah. 
And if <span class="gemarra-regular">a wealthy</span> man comes before the heavenly court, the members of the court <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: Why did you not engage in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Torah? If he says: I was wealthy and preoccupied with</span> managing <span class="gemarra-regular">my possessions, they say to him: Were you any</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wealthier than Rabbi Elazar, </span>who was exceedingly wealthy and nevertheless studied Torah? <span class="gemarra-regular">They said about Rabbi Elazar ben Ḥarsum that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his father left him </span>an inheritance of <span class="gemarra-regular">one thousand villages</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on land, and corresponding to them, one thousand ships at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sea. And each and every day he takes </span>a leather <span class="gemarra-regular">jug of flour on his shoulder and walks from city</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to city and from state to state to study Torah</span> from the Torah scholars in each of those places. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">One time </span>as he passed through the villages in his estate and <span class="gemarra-regular">his servants found him, </span>did not recognize him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and, </span>thinking he was a resident of the town, <span class="gemarra-regular">they pressed him into service [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">angarya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> for the master of the estate. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I beseech you; let me b</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and I will go</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> study Torah. They said: </span>We swear <span class="gemarra-regular">by the life of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Elazar ben Ḥarsum that </span>we <span class="gemarra-regular">will not let you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And in all his days, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> never went and sa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> all his possessions and his property; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>he would <span class="gemarra-regular">sit and engage in </span>the study of <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah all day and all night.</span>
And if a wicked man comes to judgment, the members of the court <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: Why did you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not engage in Torah? If he said: I was handsome </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and preoccupied with my </span>evil <span class="gemarra-regular">inclination, </span>as I had many temptations, <span class="gemarra-regular">they say to him: Were you any more handsome </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than Joseph, </span>who did not neglect Torah despite his beauty? <span class="gemarra-regular">They said about Joseph the righteous: Each and every day, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the wife of Potiphar seduced him with words. </span>In addition, <span class="gemarra-regular">the clothes that she wore to </span>entice <span class="gemarra-regular">him in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> morning, she did not wear to </span>entice <span class="gemarra-regular">him in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> evening. The clothes that she wore to </span>entice <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the evening, she did not wear to </span>entice <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the morning </span>of the next day. 
One day <span class="gemarra-regular">she said to him: Submit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>and have relations with me.<br><span class="gemarra-regular">He said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">her: No. </span><br><span class="gemarra-regular">She said to him: I will incarcerate you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the prison. He said to her: </span>I do not fear you, as it is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“God releases prisoners” </span>(Psalms 146:7). <br><span class="gemarra-regular">She said to him: I will </span>cause you to be <span class="gemarra-regular">bent over </span>with suffering. <br>He said: <span class="gemarra-regular">“God </span><span class="gemarra-regular">straightens those who are bent over” </span>(Psalms 146:8). <br>She said <span class="gemarra-regular">I will blind your eyes. </span><br>He said to her <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">God opens the eyes of the blind” </span>(Psalms 146:8). <br><span class="gemarra-regular">She gave him a thousand talents of silver to submit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to her, “to lie with her and be with her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Genesis 39:10), <span class="gemarra-regular">and he refused. </span>
The Gemara elaborates: Had he submitted to her <span class="gemarra-regular">to lie with her in this world, </span>it would have been decreed in Heaven that he would <span class="gemarra-regular">be with her</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the World-to-Come. </span>Therefore, he refused. <span class="gemarra-regular">Consequently, Hillel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> obligates the poor </span>to study Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar ben Ḥarsum</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> obligates the wealthy, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Joseph obligates the wicked. </span>For each category of people, there is a role model who overcame his preoccupations and temptations to study Torah.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">comes </span>and stands <span class="gemarra-regular">next to his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bull</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and his bull was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> standing between the Entrance Hall and the altar </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> head </span>facing <span class="gemarra-regular">to the south and its face to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> west. And the priest stands to the east </span>of the bull, <span class="gemarra-regular">and his face </span>points <span class="gemarra-regular">to the west. And </span>the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">places his two hands on </span>the bull <span class="gemarra-regular">and confesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And this is what he would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>in his confession: <span class="gemarra-regular">Please, God, I have sinned, I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have done wrong, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">I have rebelled before You, I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and my family.

Daf 36a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that when the High Priest recites his confession, the bull stands between the Entrance Hall to the Sanctuary and the altar, and elsewhere (41b) it is stated that the bull is slaughtered at the place where the confession is recited. Apparently, the place where the confession is recited must be considered north. The Gemara clarifies: About <span class="gemarra-regular">whom </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did you learn that he said </span>that the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Entrance Hall and the altar </span>is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">north </span>and is therefore a valid location for slaughtering offerings of the most sacred order, based on the verse written with regard to the burnt-offering: “On the side of the altar northward” (Leviticus 1:11)? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">north</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> It is the area <span class="gemarra-regular">from the northern wall of the altar until the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wall of the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard. And opposite the entire altar</span> is also considered <span class="gemarra-regular">north; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda. And Rabbi Elazar, son of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Shimon, adds even </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the Entrance Hall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the altar </span>to the area that is considered north. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">adds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the areas to the north in <span class="gemarra-regular">the place where the priests walk, and even</span> areas to the north in <span class="gemarra-regular">the place where the Israelites</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> walk, </span>are considered north in terms of the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of slaughtering offerings. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, everyone agrees that </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">from the</span> chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">of the knive</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and inward, </span>which is an area off to the side, <span class="gemarra-regular">is unfit </span>for slaughtering offerings of the most sacred order, as it is not visible from the altar. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Shimon, and not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">now, </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">add </span>only to the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehuda, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">does not ad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon? </span>After all, the area deemed north according to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, is included in the area deemed north by Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. Therefore, the mishna could be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi as well. 
The Gemara reformulates its suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what we are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">saying: If </span>the mishna were in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that the entire courtyard is considered north, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us stand </span>the bull anywhere <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the entire courtyard </span>and not necessarily between the Entrance Hall and the altar. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>do you suggest? The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>only in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon? </span>According to his opinion one could suggest: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let us stand </span>the bull <span class="gemarra-regular">between the altar and the wall, </span>as everyone agrees that this area is considered north. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what have you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to say </span>to explain why the bull is positioned specifically between the Entrance Hall and the altar? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">due</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the weakness </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest, </span>so that he need not exert himself and walk long distances on Yom Kippur. According to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the weakness </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest </span>that the bull is positioned specifically there, although it is permitted to position the bull anywhere in the courtyard. 
§ The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">The head </span>of the bull was facing <span class="gemarra-regular">to the south and its face </span>was facing <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> west</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: Under <span class="gemarra-regular">what circumstances </span>can a case <span class="gemarra-regular">be found </span>where its head is toward one direction and its face is toward another? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>It is a case where the animal is standing north-south and <span class="gemarra-regular">it turns its head </span>and faces west. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let us stand it straight </span>east-west with its back to the altar and its head facing the Sanctuary. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: It is </span>prohibited due to <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree lest</span> the bull <span class="gemarra-regular">defecate </span>opposite the altar, which is a display of contempt for the altar. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: How </span>does the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">place</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his hands </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">the offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> In the offerings of the most sacred order, the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">stands in the north</span> of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and its face </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">to the west</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the one who is placing his hands stands to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the east </span>of the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">and his face </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the west, and he places his two hands between the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two horns of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">offering, provided </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing interposes between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his </span>hands <span class="gemarra-regular">and the offering. And he confesse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> his sins. If the confession is <span class="gemarra-regular">over a sin-offering, </span>he confesses the <span class="gemarra-regular">transgression </span>for which he is bringing the <span class="gemarra-regular">sin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offering, </span>i.e., unwitting violation of a prohibition punishable by <span class="it-text">karet</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And over a guilt-offering </span>he confesses <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">transgression </span>for which he is bringing the <span class="gemarra-regular">guilt-offering, </span>e.g., theft or misuse of consecrated property. <span class="gemarra-regular">And over a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> burnt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> with regard to which the Torah does not specify for which transgressions it is brought, he confesses <span class="gemarra-regular">the sin of </span>not leaving <span class="gemarra-regular">gleanings</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forgotten sheaves, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> produce of the corners [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], as well as </span>not separating <span class="gemarra-regular">poor man’s tithe. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says: A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> burnt-offering is brought only over </span>the failure to fulfill <span class="gemarra-regular">a positive </span>mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">and over </span>violation of <span class="gemarra-regular">a prohibition that</span> after violation <span class="gemarra-regular">is transformed into a positive </span>mitzva. This refers to all prohibitions followed by positive mitzvot intended to rectify them; e.g., the prohibition against robbery is followed in the Torah by a positive mitzva for the robber to return the object that he stole. These transgressions are not punishable by lashes nor does a human court administer any other form of penalty. However, a burnt-offering is required in order to gain divine atonement for the sinner. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they disagree? Rabbi Yirmeya said: </span>

Daf 36b

It is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition </span>against eating <span class="gemarra-regular">an unslaughtered animal carcass, </span>and similar prohibitions, that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree. </span>The Torah says: “You shall not eat any unslaughtered animal carcass; give it to the stranger in your community to eat” (Deuteronomy 14:21). The dispute is whether this is a prohibition that after violation is transformed into a positive mitzva or whether it is a standard prohibition punishable by lashes. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva holds: It is a full-fledged prohibition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> violators of which are flogged, as is the case with regard to violators of standard Torah prohibitions. In his opinion, this is not a case of a prohibition that after violation is transformed into a positive mitzva, as the positive mitzva: “Give it to the stranger in your community to eat,” in no way rectifies the prohibition that was violated. If the carcass was eaten, obviously it cannot then be given to the stranger. Apparently, the verse means that due to the prohibition against eating it, one should give it to the stranger. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei HaGelili holds: It is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not a full-fledged prohibition; </span>rather, it is a prohibition that after violation is transformed into a positive mitzva. Because the positive command appears after the prohibition, it is tantamount to a prohibition that can be rectified. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said that everyone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">agrees that the prohibition of </span>eating an unslaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">animal carcass </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is a full-fledged prohibition, </span>and it is not a prohibition that after violation is transformed into a positive mitzva, <span class="gemarra-regular">and here, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the positive mitzva written after the prohibitions with regard to gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and <span class="it-text">pe’a</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree. </span>The verse states: “And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corner of your field, neither shall you gather the gleaning of your harvest. And you shall not glean your vineyard, neither shall you gather the fallen fruit of your vineyard; <span class="gemarra-regular">you shall leave </span>them for the poor and for the stranger, I am the Lord your God (Leviticus 19:9–10). After listing the prohibitions: You shall not wholly reap, you shall not glean, and you shall not gather, the Torah commands: You shall leave them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva holds </span>that the positive mitzva: <span class="gemarra-regular">You shall leave, indicates </span>that one leaves gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and <span class="it-text">pe’a</span> in the field <span class="gemarra-regular">from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> outset, </span>and is not in effect after he violates the prohibition of: You shall not wholly reap. If one fails to fulfill that mitzva, he violates full-fledged prohibitions punishable by lashes. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili holds </span>that the positive mitzva: <span class="gemarra-regular">You shall leave, indicates now, </span>after one violated the prohibition. Even if the individual violated the prohibitions and harvested those crops, there is an obligation to rectify his actions by leaving the produce he harvested for the poor. This is not a full-fledged prohibition; rather, it is a prohibition that after violation is transformed into a positive mitzva that rectifies the transgression. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">How does he confess</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>What is the formula of the confession? It is: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have done wrong, I have rebelled, and I have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sinned. And likewise, with regard to the scapegoat, it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that the confession is in that order: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall confess over it all of the children of Israel’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s wrongdoings and all their rebellions and all their sins”</span> (Leviticus 16:21). <span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise, </span>when God revealed Himself to <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses it says: “Forgiving wrongdoing and rebellion and sin” </span>(Exodus 34:7). This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Rabbis say </span>that the meaning of these terms is: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wrongdoings are intentional </span>transgressions, <span class="gemarra-regular">and likewise it says: “That soul</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall be cut off, it bears its guilt” </span>(Numbers 15:31). This refers to sins committed intentionally. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rebellions are rebellious </span>transgressions, when one not only intends to violate a prohibition but does so as an act of defiance against God. <span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise, it says: “The king of Moab rebelled [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pasha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] against me” </span>(II Kings 3:7). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “Then Livna rebelled at that time” </span>(II Kings 8:22). With regard to the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">All of their sins, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these are unwitting sins. And it says: “If a soul </span><span class="gemarra-regular">should sin unwittingly” </span>(Leviticus 4:2). In light of these definitions the sequence suggested by Rabbi Meir is unlikely, as <span class="gemarra-regular">once</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he confessed the wrongdoings and rebellions, </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">he then </span><span class="gemarra-regular">confess the unwitting </span>sins? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, this is </span>the manner in which <span class="gemarra-regular">he confesses: I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have sinned, I have done wrong, and I have rebelled </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before You, I and my household. And likewise, with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to David it says </span>in this sequence: <span class="gemarra-regular">“We have sinned</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> along with our forefathers, we have done wrong, we have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> performed evil” </span>(Psalms 106:6). <span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise, with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Solomon it says: “We have sinned, and we have done </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wrong, we have done evil” </span>(I Kings 8:47). <span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, with regard to Daniel it says: “We have sinned, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we have done wrong, and we have done evil, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we have rebelled” </span>(Daniel 9:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>according to this interpretation, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the rationale for the sequence of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Moses said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Forgiving wrongdoing and rebellion and sin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>where sin appears last? <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses said before the Holy One</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, when the Jewish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> people sin before you and repent, render their intentional sins</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like unwitting ones</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> forgive wrongdoing and rebellion as if they were sin. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with the statement of the Rabbis. </span>The confession begins with the unwitting sins and concludes with the severe rebellions. The Gemara expresses surprise concerning the need for this ruling: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, based on the principle: In a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">an individual and the many, </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the many</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>in this case that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rationale </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Meir is reasonable, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses </span>is written in the order stated by Rabbi Meir and <span class="gemarra-regular">supports his </span>opinion, therefore Rabba bar Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is nevertheless in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. 
The Gemara relates that there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who descende</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to lead the prayers <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabba, and he performed </span>the confession sequence in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir. </span>Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: Have you forsaken </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who are the many, <span class="gemarra-regular">and performed </span>the confession sequence in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir? </span>That person <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabba: I hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meir, as it is written </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Torah of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Moses. </span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a halakhic midrash that it is written: “And Aaron is to offer his own bull as a sin-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">and atone </span>for himself and for his household” (Leviticus 16:6). Apparently, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse is speaking of atonement </span>achieved through <span class="gemarra-regular">words </span>of confession. Do <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement </span>achieved through <span class="gemarra-regular">words, or perhaps it is only atonement </span>achieved through sprinkling <span class="gemarra-regular">blood, </span>as each mention of atonement associated with an offering involves the sprinkling of blood on the altar? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">I will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">infer </span>via a verbal analogy: <span class="gemarra-regular">Atonement is stated here, </span>with regard to the bull of the sin-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and atonement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is stated there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> with regard to the scapegoat: “And the goat designated by the lottery for Azazel shall be left standing alive before God, to atone with it” (Leviticus 16:10). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement that is stated with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the goat </span>is atonement achieved through <span class="gemarra-regular">words, </span>as neither is the goat slaughtered nor is its blood sprinkled on the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement stated with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the bull </span>refers to atonement achieved through <span class="gemarra-regular">words.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is your wish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to state </span>a claim rejecting that proof, there is a different proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">It says: “And Aaron shall then offer his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bull of sin-offering and atone for himself and his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> household. </span>And he shall slaughter his bull of sin-offering” (Leviticus 16:11). Here, the term atonement is used despite the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the bull has not yet been slaughtered. </span>Apparently, the atonement of the bull is achieved through confession and not through sprinkling the blood. 
The Gemara seeks to clarify the midrash: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is your wish to say, </span>which indicates that there is room to undermine the first source? Why is a second source required? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that instead of deriving the atonement of the bull from the atonement of the scapegoat, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us derive </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> goat that is offered within, whose atonement is </span>achieved <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span>sprinkling its <span class="gemarra-regular">blood </span>in the innermost sanctum; therefore, it was taught in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">it says: And atone</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the bull has not yet been slaughtered. </span>

Daf 37a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>is it derived that the confession must begin with the word <span class="gemarra-regular">please</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> It is stated here: Atonement, and it is stated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>just before Moses’s plea following the sin of the Golden Calf <span class="gemarra-regular">at Horeb: </span>“Perhaps I may secure <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement</span> for your sin” (Exodus 32:30). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>the prayer includes: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Please, </span>this people is guilty of a great sin” (Exodus 32:31), <span class="gemarra-regular">so too here, </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">please </span>should be used. <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the Yom Kippur confession includes <span class="gemarra-regular">the name </span>of God? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated here: Atonement, and it is stated with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the heifer whose neck is broken: “Atone, </span>O God, for Your nation of Israel whom You redeemed, and do not let guilt for the blood of the innocent remain among Your people Israel, and they will be atoned of bloodguilt” (Deuteronomy 21:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>with regard to the heifer, <span class="gemarra-regular">the name </span>of God is mentioned, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the name </span>of God is mentioned. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Granted, </span>the obligation to include the name of God in the confession at <span class="gemarra-regular">Horeb cannot be derived from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> heifer whose neck is broken, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">what was, was. </span>The sin of the Golden Calf predated the mitzva of the heifer. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, you </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>that the confession in the ritual of the <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer whose neck is broken </span>requires use of the term: Please, <span class="gemarra-regular">from Horeb, </span>where Moses employed that term. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say that is so, </span>and the term: Please, should be employed, <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">the priests say: “Aton</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e,</span> O God, <span class="gemarra-regular">for Your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nation, Israel” </span>(Deuteronomy 21:8), <span class="gemarra-regular">while </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not state </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">please. </span>Apparently, the formula of confession during the ritual of the heifer is not derived from Horeb. The Gemara says: It is indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult </span>why that is not derived. 
§ The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> the priests and the people who were in the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">respond after he </span>recites the name of God: Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom forever and all time. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>the following with regard to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“When </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I call out the name of the Lord, give glory </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to our God” </span>(Deuteronomy 32:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses said to the Jewish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> people: When I mention the name of the Holy One</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Blessed be He, you give </span>Him <span class="gemarra-regular">glory </span>and recite praises in his honor. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya, son of the brother of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehoshua, says </span>that proof for the practice is from a different source: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The memory of the righteous shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be for a blessing” </span>(Proverbs 10:7). <span class="gemarra-regular">The prophet, </span>Solomon, <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the Jewish people</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> When I mention the Righteous</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> One of all worlds, you accord Him a blessing. </span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The priest then <span class="gemarra-regular">came to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">eastern </span>side <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, </span>farthest from the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">north of the altar. The deputy </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his right, and the head of the patrilineal family </span>belonging to the priestly watch that was assigned to serve in the Temple that week was <span class="gemarra-regular">to his left. And </span>they arranged <span class="gemarra-regular">two goats there, and there was a </span>lottery <span class="gemarra-regular">receptacle </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and in it were two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lots</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">These were </span>originally made of <span class="gemarra-regular">boxwood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the High Priest Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gaml</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">fashioned them of gold, </span>and the people <span class="gemarra-regular">would mention him favorably </span>for what he did. 
Since the mishna mentions an item designed to enhance the Temple service, it also lists other such items: The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Katin made twelve spigots for the basi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> so that several priests could sanctify their hands and feet at once, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>previously the basin <span class="gemarra-regular">had only two. He also</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> made a machine [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mukheni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>sinking <span class="gemarra-regular">the basi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> into flowing water during the night <span class="gemarra-regular">so that its water </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would not be disqualified by remaining overnight. </span>Had the water remained in the basin overnight, it would have been necessary to pour it out the following morning. By immersing the basin in flowing water, the water inside remained fit for use the next morning. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">King Munbaz would </span>contribute the funds required to <span class="gemarra-regular">make the handles of all the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yom Kippur vessels of gold. </span>Queen <span class="gemarra-regular">Helene, his mother, fashioned</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span>decorative <span class="gemarra-regular">gold chandelie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> above the entrance of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sanctuary. She also fashioned a golden tablet [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tavla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which the </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">portion </span>relating to <span class="gemarra-italic">sota</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was written. </span>The tablet could be utilized to copy this Torah portion, so that a Torah scroll need not be taken out for that purpose. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Nicanor, miracles were performed to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his doors, </span>the doors in the gate of the Temple named for him, the Gate of Nicanor. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the people <span class="gemarra-regular">would mention </span>all of <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>whose contributions were listed <span class="gemarra-regular">favorably</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it says </span>in the mishna that the priest comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">north of the altar, </span>it can be learned <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">altar </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">does not stand in the north </span>but in the south of the courtyard. The Gemara asks: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is the mishna? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that from the verse: “And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">northward</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before God” </span>(Leviticus 1:11), it is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire north </span>side should <span class="gemarra-regular">be vacant. </span>The altar is in the south, and the north is vacant. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t the first clause, </span>the previous mishna, as explained above, in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, son of Rabbi Shimon, </span>who holds that the altar was partially in the north? The Gemara rejects this assertion: The <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>mishna, including the first clause, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov. </span>Emend the previous mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">and teach </span>it as referring to the space <span class="gemarra-regular">adjacent to </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the Entrance Hall and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> altar </span>and not actually the space between them, north of the altar, where everyone agrees that it is the north. 
§ The mishna states that <span class="gemarra-regular">the deputy </span>High Priest stands <span class="gemarra-regular">to the right </span>of the High Priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the head of the patrilineal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">family is to his left. Rav Yehuda said </span>with regard to the laws of etiquette: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who walks to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">right of his teacher is a boor, </span>in that he hasn’t the slightest notion of good manners. The Gemara asks: Didn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">we learn </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> deputy, </span>who is like a student to the High Priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">is to the right </span>of the High Priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> head of the patrilineal </span>priestly <span class="gemarra-regular">family </span>responsible for the Temple service that day <span class="gemarra-regular">is to his left? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> furthermore, it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Three </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were walking on the roa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> should not walk in single file but should walk with <span class="gemarra-regular">the teacher in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">middle, the greater </span>of the students <span class="gemarra-regular">on his right, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the lesser </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">to his left. And so too </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do we find with the three ministering angel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who came</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Abraham: Michael, </span>the greatest of the three, was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle, Gabriel was to his right, and Raphael </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was to his left. </span>Apparently, a student walks to the right of his teacher. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel bar Pappa interpreted it before Rav Adda: </span>He does not walk next to his teacher as an equal, but walks slightly behind him <span class="gemarra-regular">so that he is </span>slightly <span class="gemarra-regular">obscured </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by his teacher. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who walks next to his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teacher is a boor; </span>one who walks <span class="gemarra-regular">behind his teacher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>allowing his teacher to walk before him, <span class="gemarra-regular">is among the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> arrogant. </span>The Gemara answers: He does not walk directly beside him but slightly <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">sid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and slightly behind his teacher.
§ The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>a lottery <span class="gemarra-regular">receptacle </span>in the east of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">there, and in it were two lots. The Sages taught</span> the following in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Aaron shall place lots on the two goats, </span>one lot for God and one lot for Azazel” (Leviticus 16:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">Lots </span>is a general term; they may be fashioned <span class="gemarra-regular">from any material, </span>as the Torah does not specify the material of which they are made. 
One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">place two </span>lots <span class="gemarra-regular">on this </span>goat <span class="gemarra-regular">and two </span>lots <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>goat; therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “One lot for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> God and one lot for Azazel” </span>(Leviticus 16:8), meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">there is only one lot here for God, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is only one lot here for Azazel. </span>Likewise, one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>the lot <span class="gemarra-regular">of God </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the lot <span class="gemarra-regular">of Azazel on this </span>goat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the lot <span class="gemarra-regular">of God and </span>the lot <span class="gemarra-regular">of Azazel on that </span>goat; therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: One lot for God, </span>i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">there is only one </span>lot <span class="gemarra-regular">here for God, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is only one </span>lot <span class="gemarra-regular">here for Azazel. If so, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states lots, </span>in the plural, since each of the two goats has one lot not two? It is to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the two lots should <span class="gemarra-regular">be identical; </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he should not make one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of gold and one of silver, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">one big and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one small. </span>
It was taught in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the <span class="gemarra-regular">lots </span>may be fashioned <span class="gemarra-regular">from any material. </span>The Gemara asks: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious, </span>considering that the Torah does not designate a particular material. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>only due to that <span class="gemarra-regular">which was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because we find with regard to the </span>High Priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">frontplate that the name of God was writte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">upon it and it was made of gold, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought <span class="gemarra-regular">that this </span>lot, <span class="gemarra-regular">too, </span>should be made of gold since it has God’s name on it. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: Lot, lot, </span>twice <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>other materials and not exclusively gold. <span class="gemarra-regular">It includes </span>lots made of <span class="gemarra-regular">olive</span> wood, and <span class="gemarra-regular">includes </span>lots made of <span class="gemarra-regular">walnut </span>wood, and <span class="gemarra-regular">includes</span> lots made of <span class="gemarra-regular">boxwood.</span>
§ The mishna continues: The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Katin made twelve</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spigots for the basin. </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span>Ben Katin did this <span class="gemarra-regular">so that twelve of his fellow priests, who are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> occupied with </span>sacrificing <span class="gemarra-regular">the daily offering </span>as explained above, could <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctify their hands and their feet simultaneously. </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: In the morning, </span>when the basin <span class="gemarra-regular">is full</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sanctifies his hands and his feet from </span>the spigots fixed <span class="gemarra-regular">at the top </span>of the basin because the water level is high. And in the <span class="gemarra-regular">afternoon, when </span>the water level <span class="gemarra-regular">is low, he sanctifies his hands and his feet </span>from the spigots fixed <span class="gemarra-regular">at the bottom. </span>
The mishna continues with regard to ben Katin: <span class="gemarra-regular">He also made a machine for </span>sinking <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">basin. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is this <span class="gemarra-regular">machine? Abaye said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a wheel with which he lowered </span>the basin into the pit. 
The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">King Munbaz would </span>contribute the funds required to <span class="gemarra-regular">make</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the handles of all the </span>Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels </span>of gold. The Gemara asks: If he wanted to donate money to beautify the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should have made </span>the vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">themselves</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of gold, </span>not just the handles. 

Daf 37b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>Although gold is not suitable for knife blades, as it is too soft for use in slaughter, the mishna is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">knife handles. </span>The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an objection </span>from a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: King Munbaz <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span><span class="gemarra-regular">made </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bases of vessels, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">grips of vessels, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">handles of vessels</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the handles of knives of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur of gold. </span>Apparently, knives are not categorized as vessels; therefore, the handles of the Yom Kippur vessels that Munbaz donated were not knife handles. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">interpreted </span>that Munbaz donated gold for the <span class="gemarra-regular">handles of axes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and hatchets. </span>The blades of these implements cannot be made of gold; rather, like knives, they require stronger material.
§ The mishna continues: Queen <span class="gemarra-regular">Helene, his mother, fashioned</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span>decorative <span class="gemarra-regular">gold chandelier </span>above the entrance of the Sanctuary. It was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">When the sun</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rose, sparks </span>of light would <span class="gemarra-regular">emanate from </span>the chandelier, which was polished, <span class="gemarra-regular">and everyone knew that the time </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">recite </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shema</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had arrived. </span>The ideal time to recite <span class="it-text">Shema</span> is at the moment of sunrise. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection: One who recites </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shema</span> in the <span class="gemarra-regular">morning with the men of the priestly watch</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who served in the Temple during a given week, <span class="gemarra-regular">or with the men of the non-priestly watch, </span>designated groups of Israelites who accompanied the priestly watch to Jerusalem that week, <span class="gemarra-regular">did not fulfill </span>his obligation. That is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the men of the priestly watch </span>recite <span class="it-text">Shema</span> too <span class="gemarra-regular">earl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> so that they will have sufficient time to perform the Temple service, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the men of the non-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">priestly watch, </span>who recite lengthy prayers and stand over the daily morning offering when it is sacrificed, <span class="gemarra-regular">postpone </span>reciting <span class="it-text">Shema</span>. For whom, then, did the emanating sparks signal the time to recite <span class="it-text">Shema</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>It was an indicator <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the rest of the people in Jerusalem, </span>who recited <span class="it-text">Shema</span> at the appropriate time to recite <span class="it-text">Shema</span>. 
§ The mishna relates: Queen Helene <span class="gemarra-regular">also fashioned</span> a golden <span class="gemarra-regular">tablet </span>on which the <span class="it-text">sota</span> Torah portion was written. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">You learn from this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span> may <span class="gemarra-regular">write a scrol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> that contains only several portions of the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">from which a child may be taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Sages disputed whether it is permitted to do so even for the purpose of education. <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi Yannai: </span>There is no proof from this mishna, as the tablet prepared by Queen Helene consisted of the letters <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">alef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., only the first letter of each word was written on the tablet, representing the word. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="it-text">sota</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">writes </span>the <span class="it-text">sota</span> scroll, <span class="gemarra-regular">he looks and writes that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which is written on the tablet. </span>Apparently, the full text of the passage was written on the tablet. The Gemara rejects this: Emend the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">say: He looks and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> writes like </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written on the tablet. </span>The tablet aids the scribe in remembering the text that must be written. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an objection </span>from a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">When he writes, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">looks and writes that which is written on the tablet. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And what is written on the tablet? If a man </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lay with you…and if he did not lay with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you;</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">if you strayed…if you did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not stray </span>(see Numbers 5:19–20). Apparently, the full text of the passage was written on the tablet. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it was written 

Daf 38a

with <span class="gemarra-regular">alternatin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> complete words and initials. The first words of each verse were written there, but the rest of the words in the verse were represented by initials. Therefore, this contribution of Queen Helene does not resolve the question of whether writing a scroll for a child is permitted. 
§ The mishna related: For <span class="gemarra-regular">Nicanor, miracles were performed to his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">doors. The Sages taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What miracles occurred </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for his doors? They said: When Nicanor went to bring </span>copper <span class="gemarra-regular">doors </span>for the eastern gate of the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Alexandri</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in Egypt, </span>famous for its craftsmanship, <span class="gemarra-regular">on his return</span> voyage by ship, <span class="gemarra-regular">a storm arose in the sea </span>and threatened <span class="gemarra-regular">to drown him. </span>The ship’s passengers <span class="gemarra-regular">took one</span> of the doors, which were exceedingly heavy, <span class="gemarra-regular">and cast it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into the sea, </span>fearing that the weight of the doors would sink the ship. <span class="gemarra-regular">And still the sea did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rest from its rage. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">They</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sought to cast the other </span>door into the sea, at which point Nicanor <span class="gemarra-regular">stood and embraced it </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them: Cast me into </span>the sea <span class="gemarra-regular">with it. Immediately, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sea rested from its rage, </span>and it was necessary to cast neither the door nor Nicanor into the sea. The ship continued its journey with one door <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>for the entire voyage, <span class="gemarra-regular">he regretted </span>the fate <span class="gemarra-regular">of the other</span> door that he allowed them to cast into the sea. <span class="gemarra-regular">When they arrived at the port of Akk</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> and prepared to disembark, despite the fact that it was made of copper, the door that was thrown into the sea <span class="gemarra-regular">was poking out under the sides of the ship. And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> some say a sea creature swallowed it and spewed it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> onto the land. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to this, Solomon said: “The beams of our</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> houses are cedars, and our doors are cypresses [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">berotim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Song of Songs 1:17), and the Sages interpreted it homiletically: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not read </span>it as <span class="gemarra-italic">berotim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>as <span class="gemarra-italic">berit</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">yam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> covenant of the sea, meaning that the door forged a covenant with the sea for the sea to deliver it to its place. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, </span>when the nation prospered and the people replaced the doors made of various metals, the doors in <span class="gemarra-regular">all the gates in the Temple were altered </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to become </span>doors of <span class="gemarra-regular">gold except </span>the doors in <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gates of Nicano</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because miracles were performed to them. And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">because their copper was brightly-colored</span> and high quality. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was refined [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kelonita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> copper, and it illuminated </span>its surroundings <span class="gemarra-regular">like gold</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Apropos the mention in the mishna of people who took action in the Temple and were mentioned favorably, the mishna lists <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>who took action in the Temple and were mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">unfavorably. </span>The craftsmen <span class="gemarra-regular">of the House of Garmu did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not want to teach </span>the secret <span class="gemarra-regular">of the preparation of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the shewbread </span>and sought to keep the secret within their family. The craftsmen <span class="gemarra-regular">of the House of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Avtina</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not want to teach </span>the secret <span class="gemarra-regular">of the preparation of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the incense. </span>
Also, <span class="gemarra-regular">Hugra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Levi knew a chapter </span>in the art of <span class="gemarra-regular">music</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as will be explained, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he did not want to teach </span>it to others. And the scribe <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Kamtzar did not want to teach </span>a special <span class="gemarra-regular">act of writing. </span>He was expert at writing all four letters of a four-letter name simultaneously. <span class="gemarra-regular">About the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first </span>ones, who were mentioned favorably, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “The memory of the righteous shall be for a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">blessing” </span>(Proverbs 10:7); <span class="gemarra-regular">and about these </span>who were concerned only for themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated: “But the name of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wicked shall rot” </span>(Proverbs 10:7).
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The craftsmen of the <span class="gemarra-regular">House of Garmu were expert in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">preparation </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shewbread, and they did not want to teach </span>others the secret of its production. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages </span>dismissed them and <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for and brought craftsmen from Alexandria in Egypt, </span>a large city with many experts. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>those craftsmen <span class="gemarra-regular">knew </span>how <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bake like </span>the members of the House of Garmu did, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they did not know </span>how <span class="gemarra-regular">to remove </span>the bread from the oven <span class="gemarra-regular">like they </span>did. The shewbread was baked in a complex shape, and it was difficult to place it in the oven and remove it without breaking it. The difference was <span class="gemarra-regular">that these </span>Alexandrians <span class="gemarra-regular">light </span>the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>the oven <span class="gemarra-regular">and bake it outside </span>the oven; <span class="gemarra-regular">and these</span> members of the House of Garmu <span class="gemarra-regular">light </span>the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">inside</span> the oven <span class="gemarra-regular">and bake </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">inside. </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>Alexandrians, <span class="gemarra-regular">their bread becomes moldy </span>over the course of the week, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>members of the House of Garmu, <span class="gemarra-regular">their bread does not become </span><span class="gemarra-regular">moldy. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">When the Sages heard of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> matter </span>that the bread of the imported craftsmen was of lower quality than before, <span class="gemarra-regular">they said: Whatever the Holy One</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Blessed be He, created, He created in His honor, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is stated: “Everyone who is called by My name</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, I have created for My glory” </span>(Isaiah 43:7). In deference to God, the Sages should diminish their honor for the greater glory of God <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>let <span class="gemarra-regular">the House of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Garmu return to their </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">station. The Sages sent for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>to reassume their previous position, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">come. They doubled their wages and they came. Each day </span>until then <span class="gemarra-regular">they would take </span>wages of <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve </span><span class="gemarra-italic">maneh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and today </span>they take wages of <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-four </span><span class="gemarra-italic">maneh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda says: Each day </span>they took <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-four </span><span class="it-text">maneh</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> today </span>they take <span class="gemarra-regular">forty-eight. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages said to them: What did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you see that </span>led <span class="gemarra-regular">you not to teach </span>others this craft? <span class="gemarra-regular">They said: </span>The members of our <span class="gemarra-regular">father’s house</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> knew that this house, </span>the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">is destined to be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> destroyed, </span>and they were concerned <span class="gemarra-regular">lest an unworthy man learn</span> our skill of baking <span class="gemarra-regular">and go and engage in idol</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> worship with </span>that skill. Therefore, they attempted to prevent this skill from spreading beyond their family. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for this matter they are mentioned favorably: Never was refined</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bread </span>of fine flour <span class="gemarra-regular">found in the hands of their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> descendants, so that </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">would not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sustained from that </span>technique of <span class="gemarra-regular">preparing the shewbread. </span>They ate only bread made of coarse flour mixed with bran, <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fulfill that which is stated: “And you shall be clear</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before the Lord and before Israel” </span>(Numbers 32:22). Not only must one’s behavior be beyond reproach, he should also make certain to be beyond suspicion. 
§ Similarly, the mishna related: The craftsmen <span class="gemarra-regular">of the House of Avtinas did not want to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teach about the </span>secret of the <span class="gemarra-regular">preparation of the incense, </span>at which they were particularly adept. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>members of the <span class="gemarra-regular">House of Avtinas were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">expert in the </span>technique of <span class="gemarra-regular">preparing the incense, and they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not want to teach </span>others. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages </span>dismissed them and <span class="gemarra-regular">sent for and brought craftsmen from Alexandria in Egypt.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>the Alexandrian craftsmen <span class="gemarra-regular">knew </span>how <span class="gemarra-regular">to blend </span>the spices <span class="gemarra-regular">like they </span>did, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they did not know </span>how <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cause the smoke to ris</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like </span>the House of Avtinas <span class="gemarra-regular">did. </span>The smoke <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the incense blended by <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>members of the House of Avtinas <span class="gemarra-regular">rises in a column </span><span class="gemarra-regular">like a stick; </span>the smoke <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the incense blended by <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>Alexandrians <span class="gemarra-regular">branched out to here and to there </span>and did not rise in a straight line. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">When the Sages heard of the matter, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they said: Whatever the Holy One, Blessed be He, created, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He created in His honor, as it is stated: “God </span><span class="gemarra-regular">made everything for His sake</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> (Proverbs 16:4), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they let <span class="gemarra-regular">the House of Avtinas return to their </span>original <span class="gemarra-regular">station</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. The Sages sent for </span>the members of the House of Avtinas to reassume their previous position, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> come. They doubled their wages and they came. Each day</span> until then <span class="gemarra-regular">they would take </span>wages of <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve </span><span class="gemarra-italic">maneh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and today </span>they take wages of <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-four </span><span class="gemarra-italic">maneh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda says: Each day </span>they took <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-four </span><span class="it-text">maneh</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> today </span>they take <span class="gemarra-regular">forty-eight. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages said to them: What did you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> see that </span>led you <span class="gemarra-regular">not to teach </span>others this craft? <span class="gemarra-regular">They said: </span>The members of our <span class="gemarra-regular">father’s house knew</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that this house, </span>the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">is destined to be destroyed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and they were concerned <span class="gemarra-regular">lest an unworthy man learn </span>our skill of preparing incense <span class="gemarra-regular">and go and engage in idol</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> worship with </span>that skill. Therefore, they attempted to prevent this skill from spreading beyond their family. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for this matter they are mentioned favorably: Never did a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> perfumed brid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> emerge from their homes. And when they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">marry a woman from a different place, they stipulate with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">her that she will not perfume herself, so that </span>cynics <span class="gemarra-regular">would not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is with the work of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the incense </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they perfume themselves, to fulfill that which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is stated: “And you shall be clear before the Lord and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before Israel” </span>(Numbers 32:22). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael said: One time I was walking along the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> road and I found one of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">descendants </span>of the House of Avtinas. <span class="gemarra-regular">I said to him: Your fathers </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sought to enhance their honor and sought to diminish God’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s hono</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> by not revealing their secret to others. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>although the Temple was destroyed, <span class="gemarra-regular">the honor of God </span><span class="gemarra-regular">remains as it was, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">He diminished their honor, </span>as their significance stemmed from their Temple service. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva said: One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">time Rabbi Yishmael ben Loga related to me: One time </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I and one of the descendants </span>of the House of Avtinas <span class="gemarra-regular">went out to the field to collect herbs, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I saw that he laughed and he cried. I said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: Why did you cry? He said to me: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I was reminded of the honor of my forefathers, </span>how important they were in the Temple. I said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why did you laugh? He said to me: The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Holy One, Blessed be He, is going to restore it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to us in the future </span>and we will be honored again. I said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why are you reminded </span>of this now? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to me: The smoke-raising </span>herb <span class="gemarra-regular">is before me, </span>here in the field, reminding me of the past. I said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Show it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to me; </span>which one is it? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to me: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">We are bound by oath not to show it to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">any person </span>other than the members of our family. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Nuri said: One time I found an old man </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who had in his hand a scroll </span>with the location and formula for blending <span class="gemarra-regular">of spices. I said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Where are you from? </span>What is your ancestry? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to me: I am from the House of Avtinas. </span>I asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is in your hand? He said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to me: A scroll of spices. </span>I said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Show it to me. He said to me: As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">long as the House </span>of Avtinas, <span class="gemarra-regular">my forefathers, was extant, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they would not pass it on to anyone. And now, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here it is; and be careful with it </span>not to give it to anyone. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when I came and related </span><span class="gemarra-regular">my statement before Rabbi Akiva, he said to me: And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">now </span>that they have surrendered the scroll to worthy recipients since they are unable to maintain its sanctity, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited to mention them unfavorably, </span>as even their earlier reticence was apparently for the glory of God. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">From here, </span>with regard to the cases of the Temple’s craftsmen whom the Sages restored to their posts, <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Azzai said: </span>One should not be concerned that others might usurp his livelihood and success, since at the appropriate moment, <span class="gemarra-regular">by your name </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they shall call yo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">u</span> to return to your previous position, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in your place, they shall seat you, </span>

Daf 38b

<span class="gemarra-regular">and from your </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">they shall give you. </span>Everyone has a portion designated for him by God, and the individual is privileged to receive what is coming to him, as was the case with the House of Avtinas. The principle is: <span class="gemarra-regular">No person </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">touch </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is prepared </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for another </span>by God; everyone receives what is designated for him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one reign does not overlap with another </span>and deduct from the time allotted it <span class="gemarra-regular">even a hairbreadth. </span>When the time comes for one kingdom to fall, its successor takes over immediately, as no king rules during the time designated for another. 
§ The mishna related that <span class="gemarra-regular">Hugras ben Levi </span>knew a lesson in the art of music and he did not want to teach it to others. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Hugras ben Levi <span class="gemarra-regular">projects his voice in </span>a sweet <span class="gemarra-regular">melody,</span> he <span class="gemarra-regular">places his thumb into his mouth and places his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> finger between the strings </span>of a lyre and sings. This produced a sound <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>sweet <span class="gemarra-regular">that his brethren the priests</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were abruptly taken aback. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sages taught: Ben Kamtza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not want to teach </span>others a special <span class="gemarra-regular">technique of writing. </span>What was that technique? <span class="gemarra-regular">They</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said about him that he would take four quills between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his fingers, and if there was a word </span>consisting <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> four letters </span>that he wanted to write, <span class="gemarra-regular">he could </span><span class="gemarra-regular">write it simultaneously. They said to him: What did you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> see that </span>led you <span class="gemarra-regular">not to teach </span>that technique? <span class="gemarra-regular">All</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>others with unique skills <span class="gemarra-regular">came up </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a response</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>questions about the <span class="gemarra-regular">matter </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>conduct, claiming that they sought to prevent their technique from being used in idol worship. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">ben Kamtzar did not come up </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a response to </span>questions about the <span class="gemarra-regular">matter </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>conduct, and it was clear that his only motivation in preventing his skill from being disseminated was his own personal honor. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to the first </span>people listed, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: “The memory of the righteous shall be for a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blessing” </span>(Proverbs 10:7); <span class="gemarra-regular">and about ben Kamtzar and his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">counterparts it is stated: “But the name of the wicked </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall rot” </span>(Proverbs 10:7).
§ Apropos the verse cited, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">But the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">name of the wicked shall rot? </span>How does a name rot? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: </span>It means that <span class="gemarra-regular">decay will spread</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on their names, </span>meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">that we do not call </span>others <span class="gemarra-regular">by their names</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the name will sink into oblivion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina raised an objection </span>from an incident that transpired during the Second Temple era. There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident </span><span class="gemarra-regular">involving Doeg ben Yosef, whose father </span>died and <span class="gemarra-regular">left him </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">a young child to his mother, </span>who loved him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Each day his mother measured </span>his height <span class="gemarra-regular">in handbreadths and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">donated </span>a measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">gold </span>equivalent to <span class="gemarra-regular">the weight </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>gained <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Temple. </span>Later, when the <span class="gemarra-regular">enemy prevailed </span>and there was a terrible famine in the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span><span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered and ate him. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And with regard to her </span>and others like her <span class="gemarra-regular">Jeremiah lamented: “Shall the women eat their fruit, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their children in their care [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tipuḥim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]?” </span>(Lamentations 2:20). The Gemara interprets the term <span class="it-text">tipuḥim</span> homiletically as referring to this baby, who was measured in handbreadths [<span class="it-text">tefaḥim</span>]. Even he was eaten by his mother. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Divine Spirit responds and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>Why did this happen? <span class="gemarra-regular">“Shall the priest and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the prophet be slain in the Temple of the Lord?” </span>(Lamentations 2:20). It is punishment for the murder of the priest Zechariah ben Jehoiada. This incident involves aboy named Doeg; even though the person with that name was wicked (see I Samuel, chapter 22), the boy was named for him. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">See what befell him. </span>Clearly, his name was a bad omen. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">righteous person </span>is praised <span class="gemarra-regular">for his own </span>actions, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wicked person </span>is cursed not only for his own actions but also for the actions <span class="gemarra-regular">of his </span>wicked <span class="gemarra-regular">counterpart. A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> righteous person </span>is praised <span class="gemarra-regular">for his actions, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: “The memory of the righteous shall be for a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blessing”; </span>righteous is written in the singular. <span class="gemarra-regular">A wicked </span><span class="gemarra-regular">person </span>is also cursed for the actions <span class="gemarra-regular">of his </span>wicked <span class="gemarra-regular">counterpart, as it is written: “But the name of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wicked shall rot”; </span>wicked is written in the plural. Once one wicked person is mentioned, his wicked counterparts are cursed as well. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one of the Sages who would organize aggadic </span>statements <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: From where is this matter that the Sages stated:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>derived?<span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: As it is written</span> explicitly in the book of Proverbs: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The memory of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the righteous shall be for a blessing.” </span>He then asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where in the Torah do we </span>derive this? He said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “And God </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Shall I hide from Abraham that which I am </span><span class="gemarra-regular">doing?” </span>(Genesis 18:17). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as soon as Abraham’s name is mentioned, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And Abraham shall surely </span><span class="gemarra-regular">become a great and mighty nation” </span>(Genesis 18:18), although there is no clear connection to the previous verse. Apparently, once the name of a righteous person is mentioned, it is followed directly by praise of the individual. That is the Torah source for the statement that the mention of the righteous is for blessing. 
Then he asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this matter that the Sages said: But the name of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the wicked shall rot, </span>derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written </span>explicitly in the book of Proverbs: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But the name of the wicked shall rot.” </span>He then asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where in the Torah do we </span>derive this? He said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written </span>with regard to Lot: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he moved his tent as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">far as Sodom” </span>(Genesis 13:12). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as soon as Sodom is mentioned, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And the men of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinful to God” </span>(Genesis 13:13). 
Apropos these statements, the Gemara cites another statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> righteous person </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">lived between two wicked people and did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not learn from their actions; </span>there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a wicked person</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">lived between two righteous people and did not learn</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from their actions. </span>How so? <span class="gemarra-regular">A righteous person lived between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two wicked people and did not learn from their actions</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">Obadiah, </span>who was a minister for Ahab and Jezebel and nevertheless remained God-fearing (see I Kings, chapter 18). <span class="gemarra-regular">A wicked person who lived between two righteous people and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not learn from their actions is Esau, </span>who was born and raised in the house of Isaac and Rebecca and nevertheless remained wicked. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: From the blessing of the righteous</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you infer a curse for the wicked; and </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the curse of the wicked you infer a blessing for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the righteous. </span>How so? <span class="gemarra-regular">From the blessing of the righteous</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you infer a curse for the wicked, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written </span>with regard to Abraham: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For I have known </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him to the end that he will command </span>his children and his household after him” (Genesis 18:19), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written thereafter: “The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is very </span><span class="gemarra-regular">great” </span>(Genesis 18:20). The righteousness of Abraham underscores the relative wickedness of Sodom and Gomorrah, exacerbating their punishment. 
Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">from the curse of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the wicked you infer a blessing for the righteous, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And the men of Sodom were </span>exceedingly <span class="gemarra-regular">wicked and sinful to God” </span>(Genesis 13:13), after which it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And God said to Abram, after that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lot had separated from him” </span>(Genesis 13:14); God proceeds to bless him. And <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: Even for one righteous</span> person an entire <span class="gemarra-regular">world is created, as it is stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “And God saw the light, that it was good” </span>(Genesis 1:4), <span class="gemarra-regular">and good means nothing other than righteous, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated: “Say of the righteous that he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">good” </span>(Isaiah 3:10).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">said: One who causes himself to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forget a matter of his studies </span>ultimately <span class="gemarra-regular">causes exile for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his children</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: “Because you have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forgotten the Torah of your God, I will also forget</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your children” </span>(Hosea 4:6). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu said: </span>With regard to he who causes his studies to be forgotten, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reduces him from his prominence, as it is stated: “Because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you; you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall not serve Me” </span>(Hosea 4:6).
Apropos the righteous, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: No righteous person departs from this world</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until another comparable righteous person is created, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: “And the sun rises and the sun sets” </span>(Ecclesiastes 1:5); before the sun sets the new sun has already risen. <span class="gemarra-regular">Before the sun of Eli was extinguished, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sun of Samuel of Ramah </span>had already <span class="gemarra-regular">shone </span>(see I Samuel, chapter 3), and so on throughout the generations. And <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Holy One, Blessed be He, saw that righteous people were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> few, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">He arose and planted </span>some of <span class="gemarra-regular">them in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> each and every generation </span>to ensure the presence of at least one righteous person in each generation. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: “For the pillars of the earth are the Lord</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s, and He has set the world upon them” </span>(I Samuel 2:8). Since the world rests upon the righteous, each generation requires the presence of a righteous person to provide that support. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even for one righteous person the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> world exists, as it is stated: “But the righteous is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the foundation of the world” </span>(Proverbs 10:25). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya </span><span class="gemarra-regular">himself said: </span>The proof is <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>as it is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He will keep the feet of His pious </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ones” </span>(I Samuel 2:9), meaning that God maintains the world due to the pious people. The Gemara questions this proof; <span class="gemarra-regular">“pious ones” indicates many </span>rather than a single righteous person. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>Although the text is vocalized in the plural, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>in the singular: “<span class="gemarra-regular">His pious one”; </span>God maintains the world even for a single pious individual. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Once most of a person’s years have passed and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he did not sin, he will never sin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is stated: “He will keep the feet of His</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pious ones” </span>(I Samuel 2:9). Once a person has established himself as righteous, God will keep him from failing thereafter. In <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Rabbi Sheila they say: Once </span>the opportunity to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">a sinful act presents itself </span>to a person <span class="gemarra-regular">a first time and a second, and he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not sin, he will never sin, as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated: “He will keep the feet of His pious ones”</span> (I Samuel 2:9). Once he has refrained from sin several times, he has established himself as pious and God will protect him thereafter. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “If it concerns the scorners, He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> scorns them, but to the humble He gives grace” </span>(Proverbs 3:34)? If one <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to impurify, they open </span>before him the opportunity to exercise his free will and do as he pleases. If one <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to purify, they assist </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him. </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Rabbi Yishmael it was taught </span>with regard to this verse: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable to </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a man who was selling </span>both crude <span class="gemarra-regular">naphtha [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">neft</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whose odor is vile, and <span class="gemarra-regular">balsam, </span>whose fragrance is pleasant. 

Daf 39a

In the case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to measure </span>and purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">naphtha, </span>the merchant <span class="gemarra-regular">says to him: Measure </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for yourself, </span>as I prefer to keep my distance from the foul odor. With regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to measure </span>and purchase <span class="gemarra-regular">balsam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the merchant <span class="gemarra-regular">says to him: Wait for me until I</span> can <span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">with you, so that you and I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">be perfumed. </span>Similarly, with regard to sin God merely provides an opening, whereas with regard to mitzvot God assists the individual in their performance. 
In <span class="gemarra-regular">the school of Rabbi Yishmael it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught: Sin stupefies the heart of a person </span>who commits it, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And do not impurify yourselves</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with them, so that you should not be thereby impurified</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Leviticus 11:43) <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not read </span>that term as: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be impurified [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">venitmetem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]”; rather, </span>read it as: <span class="gemarra-regular">And your </span>hearts will <span class="gemarra-regular">be stupefied </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">venitamtem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>the following with regard to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And do not impurify yourselves with them, so that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you should not be thereby impurified”; a person who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">impurifies himself a bit, they impurify him greatly. </span>If a person impurifies himself of his own volition <span class="gemarra-regular">below, </span>on earth, <span class="gemarra-regular">they impurify him </span>even more so <span class="gemarra-regular">above</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in Heaven. If a person impurifies himself <span class="gemarra-regular">in this world, they impurify </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him in the World-to-Come. </span>
Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught </span>the following with regard to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Sanctify yourselves and you will be sanctified</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Leviticus 11:44); <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctifies himself a bit, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they sanctify him </span>and assist him <span class="gemarra-regular">greatly. </span>If a person sanctifies himself <span class="gemarra-regular">below, they sanctify him above. </span>If a person sanctifies himself <span class="gemarra-regular">in this world, they sanctify him in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> World-to-Come. </span><br>Panoramic view of Alexandria

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">would mix </span>the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>lottery <span class="gemarra-regular">receptacl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> used to hold them <span class="gemarra-regular">and draw </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">two lots </span>from it, one in each hand. <span class="gemarra-regular">Upon one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was written: For God. And upon </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: For Azazel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> The deputy </span>High Priest would stand <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the High Priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">right, and the head </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the patrilineal family </span>would stand <span class="gemarra-regular">to his left. If </span>the lot <span class="gemarra-regular">for the name </span>of God <span class="gemarra-regular">came up in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his right </span>hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Deputy would say to him: My</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> master, High Priest, raise your right </span>hand so that all can see with which hand the lot for God was selected. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the lot for the <span class="gemarra-regular">name </span>of God <span class="gemarra-regular">came up in his left </span>hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">the head of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the patrilineal family would say to him: My master, High </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Priest, raise your left </span>hand.
Then <span class="gemarra-regular">he would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>the two lots <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the two goats, </span>the lot that arose in his right hand on the goat standing to his right side and the lot in his left hand on the goat to his left. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>upon placing the lot for God upon the appropriate goat, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: For God, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yishmael</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: He need not say: </span>As <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering. Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is sufficient to say: <span class="gemarra-regular">For God. And </span>upon saying the name of God, the priests and the people <span class="gemarra-regular">respond</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> after him: Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forever and all time.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need the High Priest to have <span class="gemarra-regular">mixed </span>the lots in <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> receptacle </span>before he draws the lots? <span class="gemarra-regular">In order that he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tak</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the lot for God specifically with his right hand. Since it is a fortuitous omen for the lot for God to arise in his right hand, there is a concern that he might force the result, in contravention of the requirement that the designation of the goats be made through a random lottery. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">receptacl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was </span>made out <span class="gemarra-regular">of wood and </span>did not have the status of a sacred vessel. Rather, it <span class="gemarra-regular">was unconsecrated, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and it had enough </span>space inside <span class="gemarra-regular">only for </span>the High Priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">two hands. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina strongly objects to this: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>it was constructed so that it <span class="gemarra-regular">had enough </span>space inside it <span class="gemarra-regular">only for </span>the High Priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">two hands. </span>This was done so that he could not maneuver his hands inside the box to feel and examine the lots, <span class="gemarra-regular">in order that he not </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally take </span>the lot for God specifically with his right hand. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>why was the receptacle <span class="gemarra-regular">unconsecrated? Let it be consecrated </span>as a sacred vessel. <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>if it were to be consecrated, <span class="gemarra-regular">it would be a sacred vessel </span>made <span class="gemarra-regular">of wood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not make a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sacred vessel from wood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> But if this is the only issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">let it be made </span>out <span class="gemarra-regular">of silver </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">let it be made </span>out <span class="gemarra-regular">of gold. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spared the money of the Jewish peopl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and did not want to burden them with the expense of having to make the receptacle from expensive materials. Therefore, it is made from wood, and as such it is precluded from being a sacred vessel. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna is not in accordance with</span> the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> whose opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eliezer: The Deputy and the High Priest insert their hands</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into the receptacle. If </span>the lot for God <span class="gemarra-regular">comes up</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the High Priest’s right </span>hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Deputy </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says to him: My master, High Priest, raise your right </span>hand. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the lot for God <span class="gemarra-regular">comes up in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the right </span>hand <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Deputy, the head of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> patrilineal family says to the High Priest: Speak your word</span> and declare the goat to your left side to be the sin-offering for God. 
The Gemara asks: Why should the head of the patrilineal family instruct the High Priest to speak? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let the Deputy say </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">to him. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since the lot </span>for God <span class="gemarra-regular">did not come</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> up in </span>the High Priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hand, </span>rather in the Deputy’s, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>might <span class="gemarra-regular">be discouraged </span>if the Deputy himself instructs him to speak, as it may appear that he is mocking him. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what do </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> of the mishna and <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Deputy’s right </span>hand <span class="gemarra-regular">is preferable to the High</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Priest’s left </span>hand. As such, the ideal way for the lots to be drawn is for both the Deputy and High Priest to use their right hands. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> the other <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are equivalent. </span>Therefore, there is no reason for the Deputy to be involved, and the entire process is performed by the High Priest.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And who is this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who argues with Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda? It is Rabbi Ḥanina, the Deputy of the priests</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Deputy of the priests, says: Why </span>did the <span class="gemarra-regular">Deputy </span>remain <span class="gemarra-regular">at the </span>High Priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">right </span>side throughout the day’s service? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because if some disqualification befalls the High </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Priest, the Deputy can step in and serve in his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stead. </span>It is apparent from Rabbi Ḥanina’s statement that as long as the High Priest remains qualified, the Deputy has no role in the day’s service, which disputes Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>During all <span class="gemarra-regular">forty</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> years that Shimon HaTzaddik served </span>as High Priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lot </span>for God arose in <span class="gemarra-regular">the right </span>hand. <span class="gemarra-regular">From then </span><span class="gemarra-regular">onward, sometimes it arose in the right </span>hand and <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it arose in the left </span>hand. Furthermore, during his tenure as High Priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">the strip of crimson </span>wool that was tied to the head of the goat that was sent to Azazel <span class="gemarra-regular">turned white, </span>indicating that the sins of the people had been forgiven, as it is written: “Though your sins be as crimson, they shall be white as snow” (Isaiah 1:18). <span class="gemarra-regular">From then onward, it sometimes turned white </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes it did not turn white. </span>Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the western </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lamp </span>of the candelabrum <span class="gemarra-regular">would bur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> continuously as a sign that God’s presence rested upon the nation. <span class="gemarra-regular">From then</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> onward, it sometimes burned </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes it went out.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>during the tenure of Shimon HaTzaddik, <span class="gemarra-regular">the fire on the arrangement </span>of wood on the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">kept going strongly, </span>perpetually by itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">such</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that the priests did not need to bring </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">wood</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the arrangemen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> on a daily basis, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the two logs </span>that were brought <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to fulfill </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the mitzva of </span>placing <span class="gemarra-regular">wood </span>upon the arrangement. <span class="gemarra-regular">From then </span><span class="gemarra-regular">onward, </span>the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes kept going strongly </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not, and so the priests could not avoid bringing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wood to the arrangement throughout the entire day. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And a blessing was sent upon the </span>offering of the <span class="gemarra-italic">omer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and to the </span>offering of <span class="gemarra-regular">the two loaves</span> from the new wheat, which was sacrificed on <span class="it-text">Shavuot</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and to the shewbread, </span>which was placed on the table in the Temple. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>due to that blessing, <span class="gemarra-regular">each </span><span class="gemarra-regular">priest that received an olive-bulk </span>of them, <span class="gemarra-regular">there were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">ate it and were satisfied, and there were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>only a part <span class="gemarra-regular">of it and left </span><span class="gemarra-regular">over </span>the rest because they were already satisfied from such a small amount. <span class="gemarra-regular">From then onward, a curse was sent </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upon the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">omer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and to the two loaves, and to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the shewbread, </span>that there were not sufficient quantities to give each priest a full measure.

<span class="gemarra-regular">a robber [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥamtzan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until the day of his death. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Sheila said: What is the verse </span>that indicates that a <span class="it-text">ḥamtzan</span> is a robber? The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“O, my God, rescue me out of the hand of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and robbing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> man [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥometz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Psalms 71:4). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: From here: “Learn </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to do well, seek justice, strengthen the robbed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥamotz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Isaiah 1:17), which teaches that one should <span class="gemarra-regular">strengthen the robbed, but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not strengthen the robber.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>During <span class="gemarra-regular">the year in which Shimon HaTzaddik </span><span class="gemarra-regular">died, he said to them, </span>his associates: <span class="gemarra-regular">In this year, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he will die, </span>euphemistically referring to himself. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: How do you know? He said to them: </span>In previous years, <span class="gemarra-regular">on every Yom Kippur, </span>upon entering the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">I was met, </span>in a prophetic vision, <span class="gemarra-regular">by an old man who was dressed in white, and </span>his head was <span class="gemarra-regular">wrapped up in white, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span>the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">with me, and he would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">leave with me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But today, I was met by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an old man who was dressed in black, and </span>his head was <span class="gemarra-regular">wrapped up in black, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he entered </span>the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">with me, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not leave </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with me. </span>He understood this to be a sign that his death was impending. Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">after the festival </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">he was ill for seven days and died. </span>
Without the presence of Shimon HaTzaddik among them, the Jewish people were no longer worthy of the many miracles that had occurred during his lifetime. For this reason, following his death, <span class="gemarra-regular">his brethren, the priests, refrained from blessing </span>the Jewish people <span class="gemarra-regular">with the </span>explicit <span class="gemarra-regular">name of Go</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in the priestly blessing. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught: </span>During the tenure of Shimon HaTzaddik, the lot for God always arose in the High Priest’s right hand; after his death, it occurred only occasionally; but during the <span class="gemarra-regular">forty years prior to the destruction of the </span>Second <span class="gemarra-regular">Temple</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">lot </span>for God <span class="gemarra-regular">did not arise in the </span>High Priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">right </span>hand at all. So too, <span class="gemarra-regular">the strip</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of crimson </span>wool that was tied to the head of the goat that was sent to Azazel <span class="gemarra-regular">did not turn</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> white, and the westernmost lamp </span>of the candelabrum <span class="gemarra-regular">did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> burn </span>continually. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the doors of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Sanctuary opene</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by themselves </span>as a sign that they would soon be opened by enemies, <span class="gemarra-regular">until Rabban Yoḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Zakkai scolded them. He said to </span>the Sanctuary: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sanctuary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Sanctuary, why do you frighten yourself </span>with these signs? <span class="gemarra-regular">I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> know about you that you will ultimately be destroyed, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Zechariah, son of Ido, has already prophesied concerning you: “Open</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cedars” </span>(Zechariah 11:1), Lebanon being an appellation for the Temple.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yitzḥak ben Tavlai said: Why is </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">called Lebanon [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Levanon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]? Because it whitens [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">malbin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the Jewish people’s sins</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>alluded to by the root <span class="it-text">lavan</span>, meaning white.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zutra bar Toviya </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Why is </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">called: Forest, as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written: “The house of the forest of Lebanon” </span>(I Kings 10:17)? <span class="gemarra-regular">To tell you: Just as a forest blooms</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, so too the Temple blooms. As Rav Hoshaya said: When</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Solomon built the Temple, he planted in it all kinds</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of sweet fruit </span>trees made <span class="gemarra-regular">of gold</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>miraculously these <span class="gemarra-regular">brought forth fruit in their season. And when the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wind blew upon them, their fruit would fall off, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is stated: “May his fruits rustle like Lebanon” </span>(Psalms 72:16). <span class="gemarra-regular">And through </span>selling these golden fruits to the public, <span class="gemarra-regular">there was a source of income for the priesthood. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But once the </span>gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">nations entered the Sanctuary </span>the golden trees <span class="gemarra-regular">withered, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it states “And the blossoms of Lebanon wither” </span>(Nahum 1:4). <span class="gemarra-regular">And in the future </span>hour of redemption, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Blessed be He, will restore </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">to us as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is stated: “It shall blossom abundantly, it shall also rejoice</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and shout, the glory of Lebanon will be given to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it” </span>(Isaiah 35:2).
§ The mishna states that after selecting the two lots, the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">places </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">goats. </span>Upon placing the lot for God upon the appropriate goat, he says: For God, as a sin-offering. This is just one of the occasions on which he mentions God’s name, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> (<span class="it-text">Yoma</span> 2:2): <span class="gemarra-regular">The High Priest mentions the name </span>of God <span class="gemarra-regular">ten time</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on that day: Three </span>times <span class="gemarra-regular">during the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first confession; and three </span>times <span class="gemarra-regular">during the second confession, </span>over the bull; <span class="gemarra-regular">and three </span>times when he confesses over <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> scapegoat </span>to Azazel; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>time <span class="gemarra-regular">with the lots, </span>when placing the lot for God upon the goat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And there already </span>was an incident when the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">said the name </span>of God and <span class="gemarra-regular">his voice </span>was so strong that it <span class="gemarra-regular">was heard </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">in Jericho. Rabba </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar bar Ḥana said: </span>The distance <span class="gemarra-regular">from Jerusalem to Jerich</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is ten parasangs. </span>Despite the great distance, his voice was miraculously heard there. 
The Gemara describes similar miracles in which events in the Temple were sensed a great distance away. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the sound of <span class="gemarra-regular">the doors of the Sanctuary </span>opening <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">heard </span>from a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">eight Shabbat limits, </span>which is eight <span class="it-text">mil</span>. Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">goats that were in Jericho would sneeze </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>smelling <span class="gemarra-regular">the fragrance of the incense </span>that burned in the Temple;the <span class="gemarra-regular">women that were in Jericho did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not need to perfume themselves, </span>since they were perfumed by the <span class="gemarra-regular">fragrance </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">incense, </span>which reached there; <span class="gemarra-regular">a bride </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that was in Jerusalem did not need to adorn herself </span>with perfumes, since she was perfumed by the <span class="gemarra-regular">fragrance </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">incense, </span>which filled the air of Jerusalem. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei ben Dolgai said: Father</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had goats in the hills of Mikhmar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a district some distance from Jerusalem, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they would sneeze from </span>smelling <span class="gemarra-regular">the fragrance of the incense. </span>Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said: An old man</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reported to me: One time I went to </span>the ruins of the Tabernacle in <span class="gemarra-regular">Shiloh, and I smelled the smell</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the incense from between its walls. </span>The Tabernacle stood there during the period of the Judges, and more than a thousand years had passed since its destruction. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yannai said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">drawing of the lot from inside the receptacle is an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">indispensable </span>part of the service, as it determines which goat will be for God and which for Azazel. However, the actual <span class="gemarra-regular">placing </span>of the lots upon the goats <span class="gemarra-regular">is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> indispensable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">drawing of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the lots </span>from inside the receptacle <span class="gemarra-regular">is not indispensable, </span>since the High Priest may designate the goats himself, without employing the lottery. 
The Gemara explains the dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">In</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">matters that are performed in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">white garments outside </span>of the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">are not indispensable, everyone agrees </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the drawing of the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">is not indispensable, </span>since it is held outside the Holy of Holies. <span class="gemarra-regular">When they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disagree, it is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Neḥemya. </span>He holds that all matters performed in the white garments, even those performed outside the Holy of Holies, are indispensable. <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who said </span>the drawing of the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">is indispensable </span>holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the straightforward application of the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya. And the one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>the drawing of the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">is not indispensable </span>claims that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">applies </span>only with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>matters that are classified as a Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service. </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">drawing of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lots is not </span>a Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service, </span>therefore it is indispensable, even according to Rabbi Neḥemya’s principle.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>a different version of the dispute: 
<span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya, who said </span>that all matters performed in the white garments, even those performed outside the Holy of Holies, are <span class="gemarra-regular">indispensable, everyone agrees that </span>the drawing of the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">is indispensable. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">When </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree, it is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who holds that matters that are performed in the white garments outside of the Holy of Holies are not indispensable. <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who said </span>that the drawing of the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">is not indispensable </span>holds <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the straightforward application of the principle of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. And the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one who said </span>that the drawing of the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">indispensable </span>claims that although Rabbi Yehuda’s principle is generally true, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is different here, </span>in the case of the lottery, <span class="gemarra-regular">because the verse repeated </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“which came</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> up” </span>(Leviticus 16:9) <span class="gemarra-regular">“which came up” </span>(Leviticus 16:10) <span class="gemarra-regular">two times. </span>In the laws of sacrifices, a repeated phrase indicates the matter is indispensable. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from that which was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is a mitzva to draw </span>the lots, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">did not draw the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lots </span>but instead designated the goats without using the lots, the designation <span class="gemarra-regular">is valid. </span>
The Gemara considers the opinion presented in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to that </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">version </span>of the dispute, <span class="gemarra-regular">in which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you said: In accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">everyone, </span>i.e., Rabbi Yannai and Rabbi Yoḥanan, <span class="gemarra-regular">agrees </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the drawing of the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">is not indispensable, </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> taught? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>according to all opinions. 

Daf 40a

<span class="gemarra-regular">But according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to that </span>second <span class="gemarra-regular">version </span>of the dispute, <span class="gemarra-regular">in which you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that Rabbi Yannai and Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree </span>whether the drawing of the lots is indispensable according to Rabbi Yehuda, but according to Rabbi Neḥemya it certainly is indispensable, then <span class="gemarra-regular">granted, according to the one, </span>i.e., Rabbi Yoḥanan, <span class="gemarra-regular">who said </span>that the drawing of the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">indispensable, </span>in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> taught? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to the one, </span>i.e., Rabbi Yannai, <span class="gemarra-regular">who said </span>that both according to Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya the drawing of the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">is indispensable, </span>then in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion could <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> be taught? It would appear that, according to Rabbi Yannai, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> does not reflect anyone’s opinion. Perforce, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cannot be referring to drawing the lots, and one must emend and <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as saying that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to place </span>the lots on the goats.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear</span> another challenge to Rabbi Yannai’s opinion, as presented in the second version of the dispute, which maintains that both Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya hold that drawing of the lots is indispensable. A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is a mitzva</span> for the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">to draw the lots and to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> confess </span>upon the goat to be sent to Azazel. <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he did not draw the lots </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">did not confess</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the service is still <span class="gemarra-regular">valid. </span>This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> also appears to say that the drawing of the lots is not indispensable, in contradiction to Rabbi Yannai’s opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: So too, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should be emended to say it is a mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">to place </span>the lots on the goats, this is problematic. How will you then <span class="gemarra-regular">say, </span>i.e., explain, <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of that <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: If he does not draw the lots</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is valid. If he does not confess, it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> invalid? </span>
The Gemara clarifies the challenge from the latter clause: In this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">He did not draw the lots? If we say </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not place </span>the lots on the goats, then <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference Rabbi Shimon holds </span>that while the placing is not indispensable, the <span class="gemarra-regular">drawing </span>of the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">indispensable. </span>But this is incorrect, since <span class="gemarra-regular">wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If, following the designation of the goats, <span class="gemarra-regular">one of them died, </span>a new goat <span class="gemarra-regular">is brought </span>to be the <span class="gemarra-regular">counterpart </span>of the surviving goat and is designated <span class="gemarra-regular">without drawing lots</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this is the statement of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon. </span>It would therefore appear that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should not be understood as referring to the mitzva to place the lots, but as referring to the drawing of the lots themselves. Therefore, the challenge to Rabbi Yannai’s opinion remains.
The Gemara responds: Rabbi Yannai’s opinion can still be defended by claiming that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon did not know</span> precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">what the Sages were saying, </span>i.e., whether they were referring to the drawing or the placing of the lots. Therefore, in his response to them, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is</span> what <span class="gemarra-regular">he is saying: If </span>when you say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Drawing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the lots, you are saying </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">actual drawing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the lots </span>is not indispensable, as I also hold, then <span class="gemarra-regular">I disagree with you </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to one</span> <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, namely with regard to the indispensability of the confession. But <span class="gemarra-regular">if, </span>when you say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Drawing of the lots, you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are saying </span>only that the <span class="gemarra-regular">placing </span>of the lots is not indispensable, but you assume that the drawing of the lots is indispensable, then <span class="gemarra-regular">I disagree with you with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to two </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span>, i.e., with regard to the indispensability of both the drawing of the lots and of the confession.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another challenge to Rabbi Yannai’s opinion that all agree that the drawing of the lots is indispensable, from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Various services are performed with the bull and the goat and their blood. These services must be performed in a specific sequence, often alternating between the bull and the goat.If one service is neglected and a later service is advanced to be before it, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is as follows: Failure to perform a service of <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bull </span>that was to precede a service of the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualifies </span>the service of <span class="gemarra-regular">the goat, </span>if it was performed without that service of the bull preceding it.
However, failure to perform a service of <span class="gemarra-regular">the goat </span>that was to precede a service of the bull <span class="gemarra-regular">does not disqualify </span>the service of <span class="gemarra-regular">the bull;</span> rather, it is valid after the fact. This last rule <span class="gemarra-regular">applies to the applications </span>of blood performed <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the Holy of Holies. 
The Gemara explains the challenge from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>failure to perform the service of <span class="gemarra-regular">the bull disqualifies </span>the service of <span class="gemarra-regular">the goat </span>that is advanced ahead of it. This can be understood to mean <span class="gemarra-regular">that if he advanced </span>the service <span class="gemarra-regular">of the goat ahead </span>of the service <span class="gemarra-regular">of the bull</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it is considered as though <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not performed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">anything at all. </span>Once the service of the bull has been performed, the service of the goat must be repeated. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>the rule in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that failure to perform a service of <span class="gemarra-regular">the goat does not disqualify </span>the service of <span class="gemarra-regular">the bull </span>that was advanced ahead of it. To <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is it </span>referring?
<span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if one advanced </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">applications </span>of the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bull in the Sanctuary </span>made toward the curtain <span class="gemarra-regular">ahead of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the applications </span>of the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">of the goat inside </span>the Holy of Holies, then the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should not rule that it is valid. The term <span class="gemarra-regular">“statute” </span>(Leviticus 16:29) <span class="gemarra-regular">is written concerning </span>the applications of the blood of the goat inside the Holy of Holies, which implies that their performance is indispensable to any subsequent services. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> must be referring to a case in which <span class="gemarra-regular">one advanced </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">applications </span>of the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">of the bull inside </span>the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">ahead of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">drawing </span>of the lots? If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact that the <span class="gemarra-regular">sequencing </span>of drawing the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not indispensable, </span>one may infer that the <span class="gemarra-regular">drawing </span>of the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">itself is also not indispensable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This would then refute Rabbi Yannai’s opinion.
The Gemara questions whether this is the only possible interpretation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> could be referring to a case in which <span class="gemarra-regular">one advanced </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">applications </span>of the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">of the bull upon the altar ahead of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the applications </span>of the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">of the goat in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sanctuary </span>made toward the curtain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as such, ruling in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that this is valid after the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Matters that are performed in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">white garments outside </span>of the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">are not indispensable. </span>Therefore, the applications of the bull’s blood upon the altar cannot disqualify a different service. 
The Gemara rejects this as a possible interpretation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t </span>the conclusion of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>that the rule <span class="gemarra-regular">applies to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">applications </span>of blood performed <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the Holy of Holies? If so, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cannot be referring to application of blood made upon the altar. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> must understood in the way suggested by the Gemara previously, which implies that the drawing of the lots is not indispensable. However, this is not necessarily a refutation of the opinion of Rabbi Yannai. One could say: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, who said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">drawing </span>of the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not indispensable. </span>Rabbi Yannai claimed only that Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya agreed that it is indispensable. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you wish, say: Actually, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. </span>Nevertheless, Rabbi Yannai’s opinion may still be defended: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">sequencing </span>of the drawing of the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> indispensable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> however it may still be true that the <span class="gemarra-regular">drawing </span>itself is <span class="gemarra-regular">nevertheless indispensable. </span>This contradicts what was suggested previously, that one may infer from the indispensability of the sequencing to the indispensability of the drawing itself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">follow</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their </span>lines of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: 

Daf 40b

The verse states: “But the goat on which the lot came up for Azazel <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be stood alive before the Lord, to make atonement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">over him, </span>to send him away for Azazel into the wilderness” (Leviticus 16:10). The verse indicates that the goat must remain alive until a certain time. Were it to die beforehand, it would have to be replaced. <span class="gemarra-regular">Until when </span>is the goat for Azazel <span class="gemarra-regular">required to stand alive? Until the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">time of the application of the blood of its counterpart, </span>i.e., the goat for God; <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the statement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says: </span>It must remain alive <span class="gemarra-regular">until the time of the verbal confession </span>over it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what do they disagree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states that the goat should remain alive <span class="gemarra-regular">“to make atonement” </span>(Leviticus 16:10). This indicates that it must remain alive until it effects atonement. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon dispute which atonement the verse is referring to. <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse speaks of atonement through </span>the application of the <span class="gemarra-regular">blood </span>of the sin-offering goat. <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">states: “When he has made an end of atoning for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Sanctuary, </span>and the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat” (Leviticus 16:20). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as there </span>the reference is <span class="gemarra-regular">to atonement through blood, so </span><span class="gemarra-regular">too here </span>the verse is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement through blood. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">This is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: “To make atonement over it”; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the verse speaks of atonement through speech</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the verbal confession that is recited over it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof that the drawing of lots is not indispensable. A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s students asked him: </span>If the lot for God <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">drawn by </span>the High Priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">left </span>hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to whether <span class="gemarra-regular">he may transfer </span>the lot <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">right </span>hand? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Do not give the Sadducee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an opportunit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to dominate. </span>If it is allowed, they will adduce this as proof of their claim that the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> are not absolute, and the Sages have the power to change them as they see fit. 
The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>Rabbi Akiva provided to disallow it was <span class="gemarra-regular">so as not to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">give Sadducees an opportunity to dominate, </span>which implies that if <span class="gemarra-regular">not for this </span>reason, it would be permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">transfer </span>the lot to the right hand. How could this be true? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the drawing </span>of the lots <span class="gemarra-regular">is indispensable? And, </span>consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">once </span>the designation of the goat has been defined by the drawing of the <span class="gemarra-regular">left </span>hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">how </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">could we transfer </span>the lot to the right hand? Perforce, the designation is not created by the actual drawing, and as such it is not indispensable.
The Gemara explains the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> can be understood in a way in which it does not provide a proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: This is </span>what Rabbi Akiva’s students <span class="gemarra-regular">are saying: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the lot was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> drawn by </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">left </span>hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to whether <span class="gemarra-regular">he may transfer it, </span>the lot, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its </span>associated <span class="gemarra-regular">goat to </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">right </span>side. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them: Do not give the Sadducees an opportunity to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dominate. </span>Accordingly, there was never any suggestion of changing the designation of the goats. Therefore, no proof can be brought concerning the indispensability of the drawing of the lots.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof that the drawing of lots is indispensable. A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches (<span class="it-text">Sifra</span>, <span class="it-text">Aharei</span> <span class="it-text">Mot</span> 2:4): <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">had stated</span> only: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The goat upon which </span>the lot” (Leviticus 16:9), <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have said </span>the intention is that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>must physically <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>the lot <span class="gemarra-regular">upon it. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">states: </span>“On which <span class="gemarra-regular">it came up” </span>(Leviticus 16:9), indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">once </span>the lot <span class="gemarra-regular">has come up </span>from the receptacle, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not necessary </span>to do <span class="gemarra-regular">more, </span>i.e., the lot does not have to be physically placed upon the goat.
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">To what </span>does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> refer when it says it is not necessary to actually place the lot upon the goat? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it means that it is no longer necessary to do so even <span class="gemarra-regular">as a mitzva, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference, </span>one must conclude that <span class="gemarra-regular">the placement </span>of the lot upon the goat is <span class="gemarra-regular">not even a mitzva. </span>This is problematic. Since it is clearly part of the Yom Kippur service, it must at least be a mitzva. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>that when the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that the placing of the lot is not necessary, it means only that the placing of the lot is not <span class="gemarra-regular">indispensable? And conclude from it </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">drawing </span>of lots <span class="gemarra-regular">is indispensable, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">the placement </span>of the lot upon the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">is not indispensable. </span>
Rava rejects the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>This cannot serve as a proof, since <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: If </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">had stated </span>only: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The goat upon which </span>the lot,” <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have said </span>that the intention is that <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should </span>physically <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>the lot <span class="gemarra-regular">upon </span>the goat, and the lot should remain upon it <span class="gemarra-regular">until the time of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its slaughter. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">states: </span>“On which <span class="gemarra-regular">it came up,” </span>indicating that <span class="gemarra-regular">once </span>the lot <span class="gemarra-regular">has come</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> up </span>from the receptacle and been placed upon the goat for even one moment, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not necessary </span>to do <span class="gemarra-regular">more, </span>i.e., the lot does not have to remain on the goat anymore. Understood in this way, it cannot be determined from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> whether or not the placement is indispensable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof that Rabbi Yehuda holds that the drawing of the lots is indispensable. A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in the <span class="it-text">Sifra</span> teaches: The verse states: “Aaron shall bring forward the goat upon which the lot came up for the Lord, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he shall offer it for a sin-offering” </span>(Leviticus 16:9). The verse indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">the lottery makes it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering, </span>but verbally designating the goat with <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">status </span>of a sin-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">does not make it a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offering. </span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: A verse is needed to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, as I <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought to come to the opposite conclusion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Is there not an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inference </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as in a case in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the use of <span class="gemarra-regular">a lottery does not consecrat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the animals with a specific designation, e.g., a woman who has given birth and must bring two birds, one as a sin-offering and one as a burnt-offering, nevertheless a verbal designation of the animals with <span class="gemarra-regular">the required status</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does consecrate them, </span>so too, in <span class="gemarra-regular">a case in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the use of <span class="gemarra-regular">a lottery does consecrate </span>the animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not </span>logically <span class="gemarra-regular">right that </span>verbally designating the animals with <span class="gemarra-regular">the required status should consecrate them? </span>
In contradiction of this reasoning, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states, </span>with regard to the goat: “He shall offer it for a sin-offering” to indicate that the lottery makes it a sin-offering; verbally designating the goat with the status of a sin-offering does not make it a sin-offering. 

Daf 41a

The Gemara now formulates the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is </span>the author of <span class="gemarra-regular">anonymous </span>halakhic statements made in the <span class="gemarra-italic">Sifra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehuda. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> from the <span class="it-text">Sifra</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: The lottery makes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it a sin-offering, </span>but verbally designating the goat with <span class="gemarra-regular">the status </span>of a sin-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">does not make it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a sin-offering. Apparently, </span>according to Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lottery is indispensable. </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one who says that the lottery is not indispensable, </span>i.e., Rabbi Yannai, according to the second version of his dispute, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation.</span>
§ The Gemara addresses a similar case of designating offerings: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: Nests,</span> a pair of birds of which one bird must be sacrificed as a sin-offering and the other as a burnt-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">become designated </span>for the specific type of offering <span class="gemarra-regular">onl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> at one of two distinct points: <span class="gemarra-regular">Either </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upon the owner’s taking </span>of them, when he initially purchases and consecrates them for his offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">or upon the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> priest’s </span>actual <span class="gemarra-regular">performance </span>of the sacrificial rite upon them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: What is the reason</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav Ḥisda? As it is written </span>in one verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And she shall take </span>two turtledoves or two young pigeons, the one for a burnt-offering and the other for a sin-offering” (Leviticus 12:8). In another verse, it is also written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span>the priest shall <span class="gemarra-regular">offer </span>them, the one for a sin-offering and the other for a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 15:15). The verses mention only the possibility of designating the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">either upon taking </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">or upon</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">performance </span>of the sacrificial rite. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to Rav Ḥisda’s ruling from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited above: The verse states, with regard to the goat of Yom Kippur: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span>Aaron shall…<span class="gemarra-regular">offer it for a sin-offering” </span>(Leviticus 16:9). This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">the lottery makes it a sin-offering, </span>but verbally designating the goat with <span class="gemarra-regular">the status </span>of a sin-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">does not make it a sin-offering. </span>
A verse is needed to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>I <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have come to the opposite conclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is there not an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inference: Just as in a case in which </span>the use of <span class="gemarra-regular">a lottery does not consecrate </span>the animals with a specific designation, nevertheless verbally designating the animals with <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">required status does consecrate them, </span>so too, in <span class="gemarra-regular">a case</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in which </span>the use of <span class="gemarra-regular">a lottery does consecrate </span>the animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not </span>logically <span class="gemarra-regular">right that </span>verbally designating the animals with <span class="gemarra-regular">the required status should consecrate them? </span>
To counter this reasoning, <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verse states: “He shall make it a sin-offering” </span>to indicate that <span class="gemarra-regular">the lottery makes it a sin-offering, but</span> verbally designating the goat with <span class="gemarra-regular">the status </span>of a sin-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">does not make it a sin-offering. </span>
The Gemara explains the challenge to Rav Ḥisda’s ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>in the case of designating the goats, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is focusing on the moment at which the lottery is held, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is neither</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the time of taking </span>the goats <span class="gemarra-regular">nor the time of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> performing </span>the sacrificial rite. Yet the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that were it not for a verse that teaches otherwise, it would be possible to permanently <span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span>the animals’ designation through a verbal designation at that time. This contradicts Rav Ḥisda’s ruling.
The Gemara rejects the challenge: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> does not contradict Rav Ḥisda’s ruling. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: Just as in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a case in which </span>the use of <span class="gemarra-regular">a lottery does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not consecrate </span>the animals with a specific designation, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if it is held <span class="gemarra-regular">at the time of taking </span>the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">or at the time of performing </span>the sacrificial rite, nevertheless verbally designating the animals with <span class="gemarra-regular">the required status does consecrate</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them </span>if that is done <span class="gemarra-regular">at the time of taking</span> the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">or at the time of performing </span>the sacrificial rite; so too, in <span class="gemarra-regular">a case in which </span>the use of <span class="gemarra-regular">a lottery does consecrate </span>the animals, although it is held <span class="gemarra-regular">neither at the time of taking </span>the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">nor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at the time of performing </span>the sacrificial rite, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>logically <span class="gemarra-regular">right that </span>verbally designating the animals with <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> required status should consecrate them, </span>if it is done <span class="gemarra-regular">at the time of taking </span>the animals <span class="gemarra-regular">or at the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">time of performing </span>the sacrificial rite? 
To counter this reasoning, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">He shall make it a sin-offering” </span>to indicate that <span class="gemarra-regular">the lottery makes it a sin-offering, but </span>verbally designating the goat with <span class="gemarra-regular">the status </span>of a sin-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not make it a sin-offering. </span>Rava has thereby explained the reasoning of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in accordance with Rav Ḥisda’s ruling.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another challenge to Rav Ḥisda’s ruling: One who inadvertently enters the Temple while ritually impure is required to bring a sliding-scale offering to achieve atonement. This offering is unique in that the specific offering one is required to bring depends upon his financial situation. With regard to this offering, a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches about the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a poor person who ritually impurified the Temple, </span>i.e., entered the Temple while ritually impure; <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">set aside money for his nests</span>, his bird pair, as he is required, as a poor person, to bring one bird as a sin-offering and one bird as a burnt-offering for atonement; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he became wealthy, </span>and he is consequently required to bring an animal sin-offering; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">afterward, </span>unaware of the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that he is no longer required to bring a bird pair, he separates his money into two portions and <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>coins <span class="gemarra-regular">are for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his sin-offering and those </span>coins <span class="gemarra-regular">are for his burnt-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering.</span>
Then, in such a case, he <span class="gemarra-regular">adds </span>more money <span class="gemarra-regular">and brings his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> obligation </span>of an animal sin-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">from the money </span>set aside <span class="gemarra-regular">for hissin-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> add </span>more money <span class="gemarra-regular">and bring his obligation </span>of an animal offering <span class="gemarra-regular">from the money </span>set aside <span class="gemarra-regular">for his burnt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara explains the challenge to Rav Ḥisda’s ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>in the case of designating the money, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is focusing on a moment <span class="gemarra-regular">which is neither the time of taking</span> the money <span class="gemarra-regular">nor the time of performing </span>the sacrificial rite with the birds. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>yet the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that through a verbal designation one can permanently <span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span>the status of the money, as is apparent from the fact that the money set aside for the burnt-offering may not be used toward the sin-offering. This contradicts Rav Ḥisda’s ruling.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: But </span>how <span class="gemarra-regular">can you understand</span> the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that way? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rabbi Elazar say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Hoshaya said: A wealthy person who ritually impurifies the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Temple and brings </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">offering </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a poor </span>person is required to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">does not fulfill </span>his obligation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Since he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not </span>and cannot <span class="gemarra-regular">fulfill </span>his obligation with that offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">how </span>can that designation permanently <span class="gemarra-regular">establish </span>the status of the money? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what have you to say </span>in order for the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to make sense? <span class="gemarra-regular">That he had already said </span>his designation of the money <span class="gemarra-regular">while in his impoverished state. Here also</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in order for the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> not to contradict Rav Ḥisda’s ruling, it may be explained in a similar vein, <span class="gemarra-regular">that he had already said at the time of </span>taking and <span class="gemarra-regular">setting aside </span>his money, which monies were for his sin-offering and which were for his burnt-offering.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Ḥaga, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoshiy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that a wealthy person who brings the offering that a poor person is required to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">does fulfill </span>his obligation, 

Daf 41b

<span class="gemarra-regular">what can be said? </span>According to this opinion, there is no inherent difficulty in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that requires interpreting it as Rav Sheshet explained; read simply, it appears to contradict Rav Ḥisda’s ruling. The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should be emended: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> says: If <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward he said. Rather, say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> says: If <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward he took, </span>i.e., purchased and consecrated the bird pair, <span class="gemarra-regular">and said.</span>
The Gemara asks: How can the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> be referring to a case where he had <span class="gemarra-regular">taken</span> the birds for his offering? If so, the next statement in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: He <span class="gemarra-regular">adds </span>more money <span class="gemarra-regular">and brings his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> obligation </span>of an animal sin-offering from the money set aside for his sin-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">what does it </span>mean? If he had <span class="gemarra-regular">taken </span>them, then clearly he is not holding onto money with which to purchase them.
The Gemara suggests a solution: That statement in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case in <span class="gemarra-regular">which he redeemed </span>the bird by transferring its sanctity to money that can then be used toward the purchase of an animal. The Gemara rejects this possibility: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is no redemption for a bird</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so this could not possibly be the case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>That statement in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he took </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bird. </span>As such, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> means: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he purchased </span>the bird for his <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offering, </span>then he should <span class="gemarra-regular">add </span>more money <span class="gemarra-regular">and bring his obligation </span>of an animal sin-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">from the money </span>he had intended to use to purchase the second bird <span class="gemarra-regular">for his sin-offering. And this </span>bird, which was purchased for his <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offering, goes toward </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a free-will offering. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he purchased </span>the bird for his <span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offering, </span>then he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot add </span>more money <span class="gemarra-regular">and bring his obligation </span>of an animal sin-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">from the money </span>he had intended to use to purchase the second bird <span class="gemarra-regular">for his burnt-offering. And this </span>bird, which was purchased for his <span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offering, goes to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">death, </span>i.e., it is left to die, as is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a sin-offering whose owner has achieved atonement with another offering. 
The Gemara proceeds to examine the dispute cited above. Returning to <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span> matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, Rabbi Elazar said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Hoshaya said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">A wealthy person who ritually impurifies the Temple, and brings</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">offering </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a poor </span>person is required to bring, i.e., a bird pair, <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not fulfill </span>his obligation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥaga said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Hoshaya said: He does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fulfill </span>his obligation.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">A poor leper</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who brings </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">offering </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a wealthy person </span>is required to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">fulfills </span>his obligation. <span class="gemarra-regular">A wealthy person who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brings </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">offering </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a poor person </span>is required to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">does not fulfill </span>his obligation. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is different there, </span>in the case of leper, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written: “This </span>shall be the law of the leper on the day of his purification” (Leviticus 14:2). The word “this” serves to emphasize that the details of the purification process must be carried out without any deviation. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>if any deviation is unacceptable, then in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause, </span>in which a poor leper brings the offering that a wealthy person is required to bring, he should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>not fulfill his obligation. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Merciful One includes </span>that case by stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">The law of” </span>(Leviticus 14:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The law of” </span>was stated <span class="gemarra-regular">in order </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to include a poor leper who brought </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">offering </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a wealthy </span>person is required to bring. One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">even a wealthy </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who brought </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">offering </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a poor person </span>is required to bring also fulfills his obligation. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states “this” </span>to indicate that the wealthy person may not deviate from what is required of him. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let us </span><span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> for the parallel case of a sliding-scale offering <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the offering of leper. Consequently, in the case of a sliding-scale offering, if a wealthy person brings the offering that a poor person is required to bring, he does fulfill his obligation, contrary to Rabbi Ḥaga’s opinion. The Gemara answers: With regard to a sliding-scale offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">excludes </span>the validity of such an offering by stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he be poor” </span>(Leviticus 14:21). The word “he” serves to emphasize that the offering required for a poor person is valid only for him. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">tied a strip of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">crimso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> wool <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the head of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">scapegoa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">positioned </span>the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite the place from which it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dispatched, </span>i.e., near the gate through which it was taken; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the same was done to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>goat that was to be <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">opposite</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">place of its slaughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">He comes </span>and stands <span class="gemarra-regular">next to his bull</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a second </span>time, <span class="gemarra-regular">and places his two hands upon it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and confesses.

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma was raised before them: </span>The mishna teaches two <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> with regard to the scapegoat: A strip of crimson is tied to it, and it is positioned opposite the place from which it will be dispatched. When the mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the same is done to <span class="gemarra-regular">the slaughtered one </span>opposite its place of slaughter, is it <span class="gemarra-regular">referring to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">tying </span>of a strip of crimson, and it is teaching that a strip is also tied on the goat being sacrificed around the place of its slaughter, i.e., its neck? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">referring to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">positioning </span>of the goat, and it is teaching that the goat being sacrificed should be stood opposite the place where it will be slaughtered? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rav Yosef taught: He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ties a strip of crimson to the head of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">scapegoat and positions it opposite the place from which it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will be sent; and </span>the same is done <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> slaughtered one, opposite its place of slaughter. </span>This is done for two reasons: <span class="gemarra-regular">So that each </span>goat, i.e., the goat for God and the goat for Azazel, <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot become</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mixed up with the other </span>one, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>so that the goats <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot become mixed up with other </span>goats. 
The Gemara explains the proof from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if you say </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is referring </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">tying, </span>it works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well. </span>Since both goats have a strip tied to them and to different places upon them, they will always be distinguishable both from one another and also from any other animals. <span class="gemarra-regular">But, if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is referring </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">positioning </span>the goat being sacrificed, but no strip of crimson is tied to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">granted, </span>each one <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot be mixed up with its counterpart, since this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one, </span>the goat to be sent away, <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>a strip of crimson <span class="gemarra-regular">tied to it, and that one, </span>the goat being sacrificed, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have </span>a strip of crimson <span class="gemarra-regular">tied to it. However, </span>the goat being sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">could </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">be mixed up with other </span>animals, since it has no strip tied to it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>must one <span class="gemarra-regular">not conclude </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is referring to tying? </span>The Gemara confirms: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from it </span>that it is so. 
The Gemara discusses <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> pertaining to the strip of crimson wool: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak said: I heard </span>a teaching that there is a distinction between <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>strips of crimson, <span class="gemarra-regular">one of the </span>red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer and one of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the scapegoat. One </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">requires </span>a minimum <span class="gemarra-regular">amount, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one does not require </span>a minimum <span class="gemarra-regular">amount. But I do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not know </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">which of them </span>the requirement to have a minimum amount pertains. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Let us see </span>and examine the matter. It is logical that since the strip <span class="gemarra-regular">of the scapegoat, which requires</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> division</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">requires </span>a minimum <span class="gemarra-regular">amount </span>to be able to achieve this. Before the goat descends into Azazel, the strip is cut into two; half of it is tied between the goat’s horns and half of it is tied to a nearby rock. However, the crimson strip <span class="gemarra-regular">of the heifer does not require division, </span>therefore it <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not require </span>a minimum <span class="gemarra-regular">amount. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama strongly objects to this: </span>The strip <span class="gemarra-regular">of the heifer also requires </span>a minimum amount because it needs to have <span class="gemarra-regular">weight, </span>in order to be heavy enough to fall into the heart of the fire in which the heifer is being burned (see Numbers 19:6). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him: </span>The requirement for the strip to have weight <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the subject of a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and Rav Yosef holds in accordance with the opinion that it does not need to have weight.
The Gemara asks: Is it true that the strip <span class="gemarra-regular">of the red heifer does not require division?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abaye raised an objection to </span>this from a mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Para</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">How does he perform </span>the burning of the items that are burned together with the red heifer? <span class="gemarra-regular">He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wraps </span>the cedar wood and the hyssop <span class="gemarra-regular">with the remnants</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the strip</span> of crimson and casts them into the fire in which the heifer is being burnt. The reference to the remnant of the strip of crimson indicates that only part is burned. This suggests that it also requires division. The Gemara answers: Emend the mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Para</span>. Instead of saying: The remnants of the strip, <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>It was done <span class="gemarra-regular">with the tail end </span>of the strip of crimson.
The Torah requires that as part of the preparation of the ashes of the red heifer, cedar wood, hyssop, and a strip of crimson be cast “into the midst of the burning of the heifer” (Number 19:6). The Gemara discusses what happens if these items burn before actually reaching the burning mass of the heifer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanin said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the cedar wood </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the strip of crimson were caught by the flame </span>of the burning heifer, and they burned in the air before coming into contact with the mass of the heifer itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is valid. </span>The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If the strip of crimson <span class="gemarra-regular">was singed </span>before reaching the heart of fire, <span class="gemarra-regular">he brings another strip and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sanctifies it </span>by ensuring it burns together with the mass of the heifer. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: This is not difficult: Here, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a case in which the flame <span class="gemarra-regular">blazes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> high. </span>Since the strip was still a significant distance from the burning mass, its burning is invalid. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>Rabbi Ḥanin is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a case in which the flame <span class="gemarra-regular">blazes low</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in close proximity to the mass of the heifer. Therefore, it is considered to have been burned together with it and is valid.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and Rabbi Ḥanin’s ruling follow different opinions with regard to whether the strip of crimson needs to have weight. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> assumes the items must reach the heart of the fire; therefore, they must have weight. Rabbi Ḥanin assumes the items don’t need to reach the heart of the fire; therefore, they do not need to have weight. The issue of whether the strip of crimson needs to have <span class="gemarra-regular">weight is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">he wrap </span>the cedar wood and the hyssop together using the strip of crimson? <span class="gemarra-regular">So that they will all be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in a single bundl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and burn simultaneously, as implied by the fact the Torah mentions all three together; <span class="gemarra-regular">this is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Shimon, says: So that they will have weight and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fall into the burning heifer. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">When</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <span class="gemarra-regular">he said</span> in the name of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan: I heard </span>a teaching that there is a distinction between <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>strips of crimson: <span class="gemarra-regular">One of the </span>red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer, and one of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> scapegoat, and one of the leper</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> One </span>of them must have the <span class="gemarra-regular">weight of ten </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zuz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and one </span>of them must have the <span class="gemarra-regular">weight of two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is eight <span class="it-text">zuz</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>of them must have the <span class="gemarra-regular">weight of a shekel, </span>which is two <span class="it-text">zuz</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">but I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cannot explain </span>which is which.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When Ravin came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <span class="gemarra-regular">he explained</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the name of Rabbi Yonatan </span>which weight each item requires, as follows: 

Daf 42a

The strip of crimson <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span>red <span class="gemarra-regular">heife</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> has the <span class="gemarra-regular">weight</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zuz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and </span>the strip <span class="gemarra-regular">of the scapegoa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> has the <span class="gemarra-regular">weight of two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is eight <span class="it-text">zuz</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the strip <span class="gemarra-regular">of the lepe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> has the <span class="gemarra-regular">weight </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a shekel, </span>which is two <span class="it-text">zuz</span>. 
And <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>further said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon ben Ḥalafta and the Rabbis disagree </span>with regard to the strip of crimson <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer. One said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>It has the <span class="gemarra-regular">weight of ten </span><span class="it-text">zuz</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>It has the <span class="gemarra-regular">weight of one shekel. And your mnemonic</span> for remembering that while both assume that only one of the extreme values was required no one suggests the middle value of two <span class="it-text">sela</span> is required, is the aphorism from a mishna: God equally values <span class="gemarra-regular">both the one who gives</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> much and the one who gives little </span>as long as his intention is to Heaven. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti said to Ravina: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not with regard to the </span>strip of the red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree; rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to</span> the strip of <span class="gemarra-regular">the scapegoat </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on that </span>very <span class="gemarra-regular">day </span>that they disputed this issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Kisi </span>died, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they made a mnemonic out of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it, </span>associating the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with his name: The death of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravya bar Kisi atones like the scapegoat, </span>since the death of the righteous person atones for his generation. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak said: I heard </span>a teaching that there is a distinction between <span class="gemarra-regular">two slaughters: One of the</span> red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer, and one of the bull </span>of the High Priest on Yom Kippur. The slaughter of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">is valid </span>even if done <span class="gemarra-regular">by a non-priest, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the slaughter of the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one is invalid </span>if done <span class="gemarra-regular">by a non-priest. But I do not know </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which of them </span>is which.
An amoraic dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated: </span>With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter of the </span>red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer and the bull</span> of the High Priest on Yom Kippur, there is a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel: One said: </span>A red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer </span>slaughtered by a non-priest <span class="gemarra-regular">is invalid, </span>whereas the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull </span>of the High Priest slaughtered by a non-priest <span class="gemarra-regular">is valid. And </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one said: His bull is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> invalid, </span>but the red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer is valid. </span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is Rav who said </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">the heifer </span>is slaughtered by a non-priest it <span class="gemarra-regular">is invalid, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: The slaughter of the heifer by a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">non-priest is invalid. And Rav said concerning this </span>statement of Rabbi Zeira: This is because <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned in </span>the Torah’s description of the slaughter of the red heifer both <span class="gemarra-regular">“Elazar </span>the priest” (Numbers 19:3) and <span class="gemarra-regular">“statute”</span> (Numbers 19:2). Because Elazar is mentioned, it indicates the slaughter should be performed by a priest, and the use of the term “statute” teaches that one may not deviate from any of the details of the service as delineated in the verses; if one does deviate, the service is invalid. Clearly then, Rav held that if the heifer is slaughtered by a non-priest it is invalid.
The Gemara analyzes Rav’s opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what is different </span>with regard to the red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer, </span>that if it is slaughtered by a non-priest it is invalid? As Rav explained, it is different in <span class="gemarra-regular">that, </span>with regard to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written “Elazar” and “statute.” </span>But with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the bull </span>of the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is also written “Aaron” </span>the High Priest (Leviticus 16:11) and <span class="gemarra-regular">“statute” </span>(Leviticus 16:34). Based on Rav’s logic, that indicates that the priest is indispensable. 
The Gemara explains: The slaughter of the bull by a non-priest is valid because <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtering is not </span>classified as a sacrificial <span class="gemarra-regular">service; </span>therefore, it does not have to be done by a priest. The Gemara challenges this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so, </span>by the same logic, the red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">also</span> be valid when slaughtered by a non-priest. The Gemara concludes: The logic that slaughtering is not classified as a sacrificial service does not apply in the case of the red heifer because the red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer is different. </span>It has the sanctity <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated for Temple maintenance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore the principles that apply to other offerings do not necessarily apply to it. 
But <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not </span>arguable, by <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inference, </span>that the slaughter of the red heifer by a non-priest is valid? If the slaughter of the bull of the High Priest, which is an actual offering, is valid when performed by a non-priest, then all the more so the slaughter of the red heifer, which is not an offering, should be valid when similarly performed by a non-priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shisha, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav Idi, said: </span>The slaughter by of the red heifer a non-priest is invalid. The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">just as in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">appearances of leprosy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">which, </span>despite their <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>being a sacrificial <span class="gemarra-regular">service, </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">require </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the priesthood. </span>Only a priest may declare the signs of leprosy to be pure or impure. It is apparent from this case that the logic of the <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference does not hold.
The Gemara analyzes Shmuel’s opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Shmuel, who said</span> that if a non-priest slaughters <span class="gemarra-regular">the bull </span>of the High Priest it <span class="gemarra-regular">is invalid, what is different </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">his bull </span>that this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? It is different in <span class="gemarra-regular">that, </span>with regard to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written “Aaron,” </span>indicating that a priest is required, <span class="gemarra-regular">and “statute</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>indicating that the requirements of the Yom Kippur service are indispensable. But with regard to the red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is also written: “Elazar” and “statute” </span>which by the same logic should indicate the need for a priest is indispensable. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is different there as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written: “And he shall slaughter it before him” </span>(Numbers 19:3), i.e., in front of Elazar, which suggests <span class="gemarra-regular">that it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> could be </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-priest slaughters and Elazar watches</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, </span>who assumes the slaughter is performed by the priest himself, how does he interpret the phrase: “Before him”? He understands it to mean <span class="gemarra-regular">that he should not divert his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">attention from </span>the heifer from the moment of slaughtering until the completion of the process. As with other matters of purification, one is required to maintain his attention on the matter; any distraction can invalidate the process. <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does Shmuel, </span>who already derived something from this verse, derive <span class="gemarra-regular">that he should not divert his attention </span>from it? <span class="gemarra-regular">He derives it </span>from the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall burn</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the heifer in his sight” </span>(Numbers 19:5). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>learn from this verse? He holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>verse is needed to teach the requirement to maintain one’s attention <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to slaughtering, and one </span>verse is needed to teach the requirement <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to burning. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to have the requirement stated in both cases <span class="gemarra-regular">since, if the Merciful </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One had written it </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to slaughtering, </span>I might have limited the requirement to that case <span class="gemarra-regular">because it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the start of the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service; but </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">burning, I could say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>there is no requirement. Therefore, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach the requirement also in the case of burning. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if the Merciful </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One had written </span>the requirement only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to burning,</span> I might have limited it to that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">because it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is now that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer is </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">being made ready</span> to be used; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtering, I could</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>there is no requirement. Therefore, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach the requirement also in that case.
As the requirement is mentioned with regard to two stages of the rite of the red heifer, this suggests that it does not exist for every stage. Therefore, the Gemara asks: It is written this way in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude what </span>stage? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we say, to exclude </span>from the requirement the stages of <span class="gemarra-regular">gathering its ashes and filling the water for sanctification, </span>i.e., taking the water in order to pour it on the ashes and mix them together, 

Daf 42b

this is mistaken because: “And it <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be kept </span>for the congregation of the children of Israel <span class="gemarra-regular">for a water</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of sprinkling” </span>(Numbers 19:9) <span class="gemarra-regular">was written, </span>and the use of the term “shall be kept” indicates that one must maintain attention even during these stages. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>from the requirement the stage of <span class="gemarra-regular">casting the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the strip of crimson</span> into the fire. The requirement does not apply to this stage, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they do not </span>pertain to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">heifer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> itself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
An amoraic dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the slaughter of the </span>red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer by a non-priest: Rabbi Ami said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid. And Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said: It is invalid. Ulla</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: It is valid, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">some say </span>that he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is invalid. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua bar Abba raised an objection </span>to the opinion of Shmuel that the slaughter is valid, thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">providing a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> support </span>for opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, </span>who holds that it is invalid: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span>a derivation <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sprinkling of </span>the red heifer’s <span class="gemarra-regular">waters, that they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not valid </span>if sprinkled <span class="gemarra-regular">by a woman as </span>opposed to <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>sprinkled <span class="gemarra-regular">by a man, and that </span>the sprinkling <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> valid only during the day. </span>The verse states: “And the pure one shall sprinkle upon the impure on the third day” (Numbers 19:19). The use of the terms “pure one,” in the masculine form, and “day,” indicate that the sprinkling is valid only if performed by a man during the day. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">From where</span> is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>the following stages among those stages that must be performed by a man during the day in order to be valid: <span class="gemarra-regular">Its slaughter; and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">collection of its blood; and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling of its blood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and its burning; and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">casting of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">cedar wood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">hyssop, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">strip of crimson </span>into the fire? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “Statute” </span>(Numbers 19:2), at the beginning of the section on the red heifer, to indicate that the same rules govern all stages of the rite. As such, I <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">I should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">include even the collection of its ashes, and the filling </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of waters</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the sanctification. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>“This is the statute” (Numbers 19:2). The word <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>limits the scope of the requirement that the rite must be performed by a man and during the day from applying to these stages.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if the word “statute” serves to include all stages in the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> and the word “this” serves to exclude some stages, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did you see to include these </span>stages <span class="gemarra-regular">and to exclude </span><span class="gemarra-regular">those? After </span>noting <span class="gemarra-regular">that the verse includes </span>some stages <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">excludes </span>others, <span class="gemarra-regular">you should say </span>the following logical argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Indeed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, we learn all </span>the stages <span class="gemarra-regular">from the sprinkling of its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> waters: Just as the sprinkling of its waters is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> valid </span>if done <span class="gemarra-regular">by a woman </span>as opposed to <span class="gemarra-regular">when</span> done <span class="gemarra-regular">by a man, and it is valid only during</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the day, so too I will include </span>in the same requirement <span class="gemarra-regular">its slaughter; and the collection of its blood; and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the sprinkling of its blood; and its burning; and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">casting of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">cedar wood, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">hyssop, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">strip of crimson.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Since these </span>stages <span class="gemarra-regular">are not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> valid </span>if done <span class="gemarra-regular">by a woman </span>as opposed to <span class="gemarra-regular">when</span> done <span class="gemarra-regular">by a man, </span>as indicated by the verses that state that they are to be done by a serving priest, who by definition is a man, then it is logical to also include these cases in the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are valid only during the day. And I exclude</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the collection of its ashes, and the filling of water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the sanctification, since these </span>stages <span class="gemarra-regular">are valid </span>when done <span class="gemarra-regular">by a woman as </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>done <span class="gemarra-regular">by a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> man, </span>as the verses never suggest a requirement that they be done by a man. Therefore, it is logical that these stages <span class="gemarra-regular">are valid both during the day and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">during the night.</span>
Rabbi Yehoshua bar Abba originally cited the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> to challenge Shmuel’s opinion that the slaughter of the red heifer by a non-priest is valid. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the challenge from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>these stages <span class="gemarra-regular">are invalid </span>if done <span class="gemarra-regular">by a woman </span>one should conclude that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are also invalid </span>if done <span class="gemarra-regular">by a non</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-priest, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the stage of <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling the waters </span><span class="gemarra-regular">serve as a proof </span>that one should not necessarily connect these two <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the sprinkling is <span class="gemarra-regular">invalid </span>if done <span class="gemarra-regular">by a woman and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">valid </span>if done <span class="gemarra-regular">by a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">non-priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If so, what was the basis for the challenge? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: This is the challenge: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman, what is the reason </span>she may not perform these stages? The verse states <span class="gemarra-regular">“Elazar,” </span>indicating the requirement for a man <span class="gemarra-regular">and not a woman. </span>The same logic should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>apply to <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-priest: </span>The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Elazar,” </span>indicating the requirement for a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not a non-priest. </span>
The Gemara considers other aspects of the rite of the red heifer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said: </span>Throughout <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> entire passage </span>of the red heifer, certain conditions apply to some stages of the rite, but not to others. These conditions are derived from the phrasing of the verses. In some stages, the conditions <span class="gemarra-regular">implied </span>by the phrasing of the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">preclude </span>the application of conditions that are <span class="gemarra-regular">implied </span>by a previous verse describing a previous stage. A verse describing one stage may imply the existence of a certain condition which applies to that stage but a verse describing a subsequent stage indicates that that condition does not apply to the subsequent stage. However, in other stages, the conditions <span class="gemarra-regular">implied</span> by the phrasing of the verse stand <span class="gemarra-regular">on their own</span> and continue to apply in subsequent stages, i.e., the verses in subsequent stages do not exclude the application of the condition derived from the verses in a previous stage.
The Gemara proceeds to demonstrate Ulla’s claim by expounding the verses throughout the passage of the red heifer: The verse states with regard to the red heifer: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall give it to Elazar the priest</span> and he shall take it out to the outside of the camp, and he shall slaughter it before him” (Numbers 19:3). The word “it” implies that only <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>red heifer, i.e., the first one, was to be given <span class="gemarra-regular">to Elazar, </span>who was the deputy High Priest, to perform its rite, but that the red heifer in future <span class="gemarra-regular">generations </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>need to be given <span class="gemarra-regular">to Elazar, </span>i.e., to a priest of similar rank. If so, who does perform the rite of the red heifer? <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">In </span>future <span class="gemarra-regular">generations, </span>it should be done <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">High </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Priest. And some say: In </span>future <span class="gemarra-regular">generations, </span>it can be done even <span class="gemarra-regular">by a common priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>future <span class="gemarra-regular">generations </span>it can be done even <span class="gemarra-regular">by a common priest, </span>it works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well, </span>since there is no indication to the contrary. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span> future <span class="gemarra-regular">generations </span>it should be done <span class="gemarra-regular">by the High Priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, from where </span>does he derive this requirement? <span class="gemarra-regular">He derives </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the service of <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur </span>through a verbal analogy between the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“statute” </span>(Numbers 19:2) written with regard to the red heifer and the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“statute</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Leviticus 16:34) written with regard to the Yom Kippur service: Just as on Yom Kippur the entire service is performed by the High Priest, so too, in future generations the rite of the red heifer must be done entirely by the High Priest.
The Gemara expounds the next phrase in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall take it out</span> to the outside of the camp” (Numbers 19:3). The use of the word “it” implies that only it should be taken out, but <span class="gemarra-regular">he should not take out another</span> heifer <span class="gemarra-regular">with it. As we learned </span>in a mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">the heifer did not want to go ou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> by itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not take out a black </span>cow <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>in order to encourage it to leave, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">people will not </span>mistakenly <span class="gemarra-regular">say that they slaughtered the black </span>cow. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we do not take out </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">red </span>heifer <span class="gemarra-regular">with it, so that people will not </span>mistakenly <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they slaughtered two </span>heifers. Slaughtering an additional heifer would invalidate the rite, since performing any additional labor during the rite of the red heifer disqualifies it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: This is not for </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">reason, rather it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is stated “It,” </span>which implies only one heifer may be taken out.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>even according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is it </span>not <span class="gemarra-regular">written “it”</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Why does he not derive the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> from the word “it”? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? It is Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon, who interprets the rationale </span>for the mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> vers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and draws halakhic conclusions based on that interpretation. Therefore, he accepts that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is derived from the word “it,” but he also provides a rationale for the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them is </span>in a case

Daf 43a

<span class="gemarra-regular">where one took out a donkey </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with it. </span>According to the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, this would be permitted, since there is no concern that people would think that the wrong cow or cows were slaughtered. However, according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, who maintains that this rationale is irrelevant, even this case would be excluded by the word “it.” 
The Gemara expounds the next phrase in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> slaughter it,” </span>means that “it,” the red heifer, should be slaughtered and <span class="gemarra-regular">that no other should be slaughtered with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> And the next phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Before him”; according to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav, </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">that he should not divert his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">attention from it. According to Shmuel, </span>it indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">that a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> non-priest can slaughter </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and Elazar </span>the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">observes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
The Gemara proceeds to expound the next verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Elazar the priest shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> take some of its blood with his finger” </span>(Numbers 19:4). What is indicated by specifying Elazar? <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Shmuel, </span>since the phrase “before him” in the previous verse indicates that Elazar himself did not need to slaughter the red heifer but that rather a non-priest could, it is necessary in this stage <span class="gemarra-regular">to return it to Elazar, </span>to indicate that he must himself take the blood with his finger. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Rav, this is </span>an example of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> restrictive expression following a restrictive expression, </span>as both verses indicate that the rite may be performed only by a priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there is a hermeneutical principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">a restrictive </span><span class="gemarra-regular">expression following a restrictive expression </span>comes <span class="gemarra-regular">only to amplif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> and include additional cases. In this case, it serves to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">that even a common </span>priest may perform the rite.
The Gemara expounds another verse in the same passage: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">strip of crimson” </span>(Numbers 19:6). What is indicated by specifying that this is done by the priest? <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who holds that in the previous stage the verse stated: “And Elazar the priest” to indicate that Elazar, i.e., a deputy High Priest, was required to perform that stage, the use of the term “the priest” in this stage indicates that a deputy High Priest is no longer required for this stage; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">even a common priest </span>may perform this stage. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Rav, </span>who holds that even in the previous stage a common priest may perform the rite, the term “and the priest” <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>here, as it could <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>these stages <span class="gemarra-regular">do not </span>involve <span class="gemarra-regular">the heifer itself, they do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> require a priest </span>at all. Therefore, the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us</span> that this is not correct. 
The Gemara expounds the next verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Then the priest shall wash his clothes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Numbers 19:7). Why is there a need to restate the involvement of the priest? To teach that he should be <span class="gemarra-regular">in his priestly </span>state, i.e., wearing his priestly garments and fit for service. In the next phrase of the verse, the involvement of the priest is restated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the priest shall be impure until evening” </span>(Numbers 19:7). This repetition is to teach that even <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>future <span class="gemarra-regular">generations </span>the rite is to be performed only by a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">in his priestly </span>state.
The Gemara analyzes this derivation according to the two sides of the dispute the Gemara cited previously: It works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well according to the one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>future <span class="gemarra-regular">generations </span>the rite of the red heifer may be performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by a common priest. </span>It is therefore understandable that the verse emphasizes that the priest has to perform the rite in his priestly state. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>future <span class="gemarra-regular">generations </span>it must be performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by a High Priest, now </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that we require the High Priest, is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to mention that he must be <span class="gemarra-regular">in his priestly </span>state? <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>sometimes there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter that </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">be derived by </span>means of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inference, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">unnecessarily writes it </span>explicitly. 
The Gemara expounds another verse in the passage: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And a man</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who is pure shall gather up the ashes of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> heifer and place them” </span>(Numbers 19:9). The verse states <span class="gemarra-regular">“a man” to qualify a non-priest </span>to perform this stage of the rite. The verse states <span class="gemarra-regular">“pure” to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">qualify </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman </span>to perform this stage. The verse states <span class="gemarra-regular">“and place” </span>to indicate that only <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>the basic level of <span class="gemarra-regular">intelligence to </span>be able <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>intentionally <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>the ashes in their place is qualified to do so, thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">excluding a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a minor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not have </span>the basic level of <span class="gemarra-regular">intelligence to </span>be able <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>intentionally <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>the ashes in their place.
The Gemara prefaces its exposition of another verse in the passage, which details the sanctification of the ashes of the red heifer, by citing a dispute concerning that stage: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in tractate <span class="it-text">Para</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Everyone </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">qualified to sanctif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> the ashes of the red heifer, i.e., to pour the water over them, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for a deaf-mute, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an imbecile, and a minor. Rabbi Yehuda qualifies a minor, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but disqualifies a woman and a hermaphrodite. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reason of the Rabbis, </span>i.e., the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written: “And they shall take for the impure</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the ashes of the burning of the purification from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sin, </span>and he shall put running water thereto in a vessel” (Numbers 19:17). The word “they” is understood as referring to those who perform the previous stage of gathering the ashes. The verse therefore indicates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Those whom I disqualified for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you for gathering </span>the ashes, <span class="gemarra-regular">I have disqualified for you</span> also <span class="gemarra-regular">for sanctification; and those whom I have qualified for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you for gathering </span>the ashes, <span class="gemarra-regular">I have qualified for you</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctification. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>why does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>not accept this reasoning? <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, let the verse say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: And he shall take. What </span>is the meaning of  <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">and they shall take”? </span>The use of the plural serves to qualify additional people who were excluded from the previous stage. It means <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">even a minor, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who I disqualified there </span>with regard to collecting the ash, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to sanctification, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is qualified. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>does Rabbi Yehuda derive that <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman </span>is unfit? The verse states <span class="gemarra-regular">“and he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall put” and not: And she shall put</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> How do <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span>interpret this verse? They assume that <span class="gemarra-regular">if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Merciful One had written: And he shall take…and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he shall put, I would have said </span>the rite is not valid <span class="gemarra-regular">unless one </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">takes and </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> puts </span>the ashes in the water. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> One writes “and they shall take” </span>to indicate that the taking and the putting need not necessarily be executed by the same individual. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if the Merciful One had written </span>two plural forms such as: <span class="gemarra-regular">And they shall take…and they shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> put</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I would have said </span>the rite is not valid <span class="gemarra-regular">unless two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">take and two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">put. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One writes “and they shall take” </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">“and he shall put” </span>(Numbers 19:17), to indicate <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">two take and one puts </span>the rite is nevertheless valid.
The Gemara continues to expound the verses: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">man who is pure shall take hyssop and dip it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">into the water” </span>(Numbers 19:18). <span class="gemarra-regular">According to the Rabbis, </span>who hold that the sanctification of the ashes in the previous stage may be performed by woman but not a minor, the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“man” </span>indicates that for this stage, the taking and dipping of hyssop, only a man is qualified <span class="gemarra-regular">but not a woman, </span>and the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“pure” </span>is written <span class="gemarra-regular">to qualify </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">a minor </span>for this stage. <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who holds the previous stage may be performed by a minor but not by a woman, the word <span class="gemarra-regular">man </span>indicates that for this stage only an adult is qualified <span class="gemarra-regular">but not a minor, </span>and the word <span class="gemarra-regular">pure </span>is written <span class="gemarra-regular">to qualify </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman </span>for this stage.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Para</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Everyone is qualified to sprinkl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the purification waters, except for <span class="gemarra-regular">a person whose sexual organs are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> concealed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tumtum</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], and a hermaphrodite [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">androginus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a minor who has </span>a basic level of <span class="gemarra-regular">intelligence, a woman </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">assist him and he sprinkles</span> the purification waters. The mishna disqualifies a woman for the sprinkling but qualifies a minor. 

Daf 43b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not disagree. </span>The mishna implies that even he agrees with the mishna’s ruling. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Master, </span>i.e., Ulla, <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>In some stages, the conditions <span class="gemarra-regular">implied </span>by the phrasing of the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">precludes </span>the application of conditions that are <span class="gemarra-regular">implied </span>by a previous verse describing a previous stage, whereas in other stages, the conditions <span class="gemarra-regular">implied </span>by the phrasing of the verse stand <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their own </span>and also apply in subsequent stages. Since it is clear from the opinion of the Rabbis that the verse describing the taking and dipping of hyssop is to be understood as indicating a change of conditions, perforce Rabbi Yehuda must also assume that there is a change in conditions, as explained above. Therefore, he certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees </span>with the mishna’s ruling, even though his dissenting opinion is not recorded in the mishna.
The Gemara expounds the next verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the pure one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall sprinkle upon the impure” </span>(Numbers 19:19). The previous verse already states that the one who sprinkles must be ritually pure. This requirement is repeated here to make the following inference: He is <span class="gemarra-regular">pure, </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference </span>suggests that initially <span class="gemarra-regular">he was ritually impur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and has now removed that impurity. This fact is significant only if the reference is to a person who has still not completed his purification process. As such, the repetition of the requirement that the one who sprinkles be pure <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches about one who immersed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that day, that he is qualified </span>to sprinkle the waters <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the rite of the red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This is one who was rendered ritually impure with a type of ritual impurity from which he will become fully ritually pure only upon nightfall. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi said: When</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish analyzed </span>the passage <span class="gemarra-regular">of the</span> red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer </span>to try to identify a consistent pattern in the way the implied conditions should be understood, i.e., when they exist to preclude conditions implied in previous stages, and when they imply conditions that remain in force in subsequent stages. <span class="gemarra-regular">They brought up from it only as the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> amount </span>of earth <span class="gemarra-regular">that the fox brings u</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a plowed field, </span>meaning that they reached few conclusions. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, they said </span>in conclusion <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>in some verses the conditions <span class="gemarra-regular">implied </span>by the phrasing of the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">preclude </span>the application of conditions that are <span class="gemarra-regular">implied </span>by a previous verse; whereas in other verses, the conditions <span class="gemarra-regular">implied </span>by the phrasing of the verse stand <span class="gemarra-regular">on their own </span>and apply also in subsequent verses. However, there is no obvious pattern of how to determine which verse employs which style. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tann</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> who would recite <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> in the study hall <span class="gemarra-regular">recited </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan: All slaughterings are valid </span>if performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">non-priest, except that of </span>the red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer. Rabbi Yoḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Go out and teach </span>that <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>the house of study, but not inside, as it is incorrect. <span class="gemarra-regular">We have not found </span>any case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a slaughtering </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by a non-priest </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">invalid. </span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>was very convinced of this. <span class="gemarra-regular">Needless to say that he did not listen to </span>that <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but he did not even listen to his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">teacher, </span>who maintained the same opinion as cited by the <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak: The slaughtering of the </span>red <span class="gemarra-regular">heifer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by a non-priest is invalid. </span>Rabbi Yoḥanan added: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I say it is valid, </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">we have not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>any case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtering</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by a non-priest </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">invalid.</span>
The mishna states: The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">comes </span>and stands <span class="gemarra-regular">next to his bull a second </span>time and confesses: Please God, I have sinned…I and my family and the children of Aaron, your sacred people. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different about the first confession </span>that he made over the bull, in <span class="gemarra-regular">which he did not say: And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the children of Aaron, your sacred people, and what is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">different about the second confession </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">which he said: And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the children of Aaron, your sacred people? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: That </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the method to which <span class="gemarra-regular">the attribute of justice lends </span>itself: <span class="gemarra-regular">Better that an innocent person should come and gain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">atonement on behalf of the guilty, and a guilty person </span><span class="gemarra-regular">should not come and gain atonement on behalf of </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">guilty person. </span>At the first confession, the High Priest has still not achieved atonement for himself. Therefore, it is more appropriate for him to wait until the second confession to seek atonement for the priesthood. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> slaughter </span>the bull <span class="gemarra-regular">and receive its blood in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bowl, and give it to the one who stirs </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The stirrer would stand <span class="gemarra-regular">on the fourth </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> of tiles <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Sanctuary </span>and stir the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">lest it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> coagulate </span>while the High Priest sacrificed the incense. <span class="gemarra-regular">He would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> take a coal pan and ascend to the top of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the altar and clear </span>the upper layer of <span class="gemarra-regular">coals to</span> this <span class="gemarra-regular">side and to </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">side and </span>with the coal pan <span class="gemarra-regular">scoop up </span>coals <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>among <span class="gemarra-regular">the inner, consumed </span>coals. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he would </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">descend and place </span>the coal pan with the coals <span class="gemarra-regular">on the fourth row </span>of tiles <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard. </span>
The mishna comments on some of the contrasts between the service and protocols followed on Yom Kippur and those followed throughout the rest of the year: <span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day, </span>a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> scoop up </span>the coals with a coal pan made <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> silver and pour </span>the coals from there <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>a coal pan <span class="gemarra-regular">of gold. But </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">this day, </span>on Yom Kippur, the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">scoops up with </span>a coal pan <span class="gemarra-regular">of gold, and with </span>that coal pan <span class="gemarra-regular">he would bring </span>the coals <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>the Holy of Holies.
<span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day, </span>a priest scoops up the coals with a coal pan <span class="gemarra-regular">of four </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pours </span>the coals <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>a coal pan of <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">this day, </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">scoops with </span>one of <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and with it he would bring </span>the coals <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>the Holy of Holies. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says </span>a variation of this distinction: <span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day, </span>a priest scoops up the coals with a coal pan <span class="gemarra-regular">of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is six <span class="it-text">kav</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">pours </span>the coals <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>a coal pan of <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.

<span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day, </span>the coal pan <span class="gemarra-regular">was heavy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">this day </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">light, </span>so as not to tire the High Priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day, its handle was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> short, but </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">this day it was long </span>so that he could also use his arm to support its weight. <span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day, it was </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">greenish gold, but</span> on <span class="gemarra-regular">this day </span>it was of <span class="gemarra-regular">a red </span>gold.

<span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificed a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peras</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>half a <span class="it-text">maneh</span>, of incense <span class="gemarra-regular">in the morning, and a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peras</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the afternoon, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">this day </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">adds </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">handful </span>of incense and burns it in the Holy of Holies. <span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day, </span>the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>ground <span class="gemarra-regular">fine </span>as prescribed by the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">this day it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was superfine. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">On </span><span class="gemarra-regular">every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day, priests ascend on the eastern side of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the ramp and descend on its western side, but </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">this day the High Priest ascends in the middle </span>of the ramp <span class="gemarra-regular">and descends in the middle.

<span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day, the High Priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sanctifies his hands and his feet from the laver </span>like the other priests, <span class="gemarra-regular">and on this day </span>he sanctifies them <span class="gemarra-regular">from the golden flask, </span>due to the eminence of the High Priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says </span>there was no difference in this regard.

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that the blood of the bull is stirred by a priest standing on the fourth row of tiles in the Sanctuary, while the High Priest sacrifices the incense in the Holy of Holies. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is it </span>not <span class="gemarra-regular">written “And there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall be no man in the Tent of Meeting </span>when he goes in to make atonement in the Sanctuary, until he comes out” (Leviticus 16:17). How then could the stirrer be standing in the Sanctuary? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: </span>Emend and <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the mishna as saying: The fourth row of tiles <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Sanctuary, </span>i.e., outside the Sanctuary on the fourth row from its entrance. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And there shall be no man in the Tent </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Meeting </span>when he goes in to make atonement in the Sanctuary, until he comes out.” The verse prohibits anyone to be inside the Tent of Meeting during the burning of the incense. 

Daf 44a

I <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought nobody should be present, <span class="gemarra-regular">even in the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states “in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Tent of Meeting,” </span>limiting the prohibition to the Temple itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>that a prohibition exists <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Tent of Meeting </span>of the Tabernacle <span class="gemarra-regular">that was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the desert, from where </span>do I derive that the prohibition applies also to the Tabernacle that stood in <span class="gemarra-regular">Shiloh, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that it applies also to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Eternal House</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the Temple in Jerusalem? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states “in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Sanctuary,” </span>indicating that the prohibition applies to any Sanctuary.
<span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only</span> that a prohibition exists <span class="gemarra-regular">during the burning </span>of the incense; <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>do I derive that the prohibition applies also <span class="gemarra-regular">during the presentations of the </span>bull’s <span class="gemarra-regular">blood </span>in the Holy of Holies? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “When he goes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in to make atonement,” </span>and atonement is achieved through the presentations of blood. <span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>that a prohibition exists from the time of <span class="gemarra-regular">his entrance </span>into the Holy of Holies; <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>is it derived that the prohibition remains in force until <span class="gemarra-regular">his exit? The verse states: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Until he comes out.</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concludes by expounding the final part of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And have made atonement for himself, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and for his household, and for all the assembly of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Israel” </span>(Leviticus 16:17). This teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">his atonement precedes the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> atonement of his household</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the atonement of his household</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> precedes that atonement of his brethren, the priests; the atonement</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of his brethren, the priests, precedes the atonement of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> entire community of Israel.</span>
The Gemara analyzes the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>that a prohibition exists <span class="gemarra-regular">during</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the burning </span>of the incense. From <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>in the verse could this have <span class="gemarra-regular">been inferred? Rava said, and similarly </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said, and similarly Rabbi Elazar said: </span>The conclusion of that <span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “And have made atonement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for himself, and for his household, and for all the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">assembly of Israel.” Which </span>act of <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement is the same</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for him, and for his household, and for his brethren</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the priests, and for the entire community of Israel? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">You must say this is the burning of the incense. </span>
Does <span class="gemarra-regular">incense </span><span class="gemarra-regular">effect atonement? </span>The Torah mentions the concept of atonement only with regard to offerings. <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, as Rabbi Ḥananya teaches </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned of the incense that it effects </span><span class="gemarra-regular">atonement, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated: “And he put on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">incense and made atonement for the people” </span>(Numbers 17:12). <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: For what does incense</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> effect atonement? For slander. </span>And why is that? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let something</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>is done <span class="gemarra-regular">in secret</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the incense, which is burned in seclusion within the Sanctuary, <span class="gemarra-regular">come and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> effect atonement for an act done in secret, </span>i.e., slander, which is generally said in private.
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there: They remove </span>themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the Entrance Hall and the altar during </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the burning </span>of the incense. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: They taught </span>that this is true <span class="gemarra-regular">only during the burning </span>of the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Sanctuary, but during the burning </span>of the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">in the innermost </span>chamber, i.e., the Holy of Holies, people are required to <span class="gemarra-regular">remove </span>themselves only <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Sanctuary. They do not need to remove themselves </span>from the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the Entrance Hall and the altar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava raised an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">objection </span>to Rabbi Elazar’s opinion from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> some say it unattributed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yosei says: Just as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they remove </span>themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the Entrance Hall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the altar during the burning </span>of the incense, <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> similarly remove </span>themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">during the </span>blood <span class="gemarra-regular">presentations of the bull</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the anointed priest, </span>i.e., of the High Priest, which he brings if he issues an erroneous halakhic ruling and acts upon it; and also during the blood presentations <span class="gemarra-regular">of the bull for an unwitting </span>communal <span class="gemarra-regular">sin </span>brought if the Sanhedrin issues an erroneous halakhic ruling and the community acts upon it; and also during the blood presentations <span class="gemarra-regular">of the goats of idol worship </span>brought for an inadvertent communal transgression of idol worship.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what higher standard is </span>applicable <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Sanctuary relative</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the Entrance Hall and the altar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Only that </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Sanctuary remove </span>themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">both during</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>incense <span class="gemarra-regular">burning and also </span>during the blood presentations, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">not during the </span>incense <span class="gemarra-regular">burning. </span>Those who are in the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the Entrance Hall and the altar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">remove </span>themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">only during the </span>incense <span class="gemarra-regular">burning </span>but not during the blood presentations.
The Gemara explains the challenge: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any case, </span>it is evident from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">during the </span>incense <span class="gemarra-regular">burning </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they do remove </span>themselves. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">during the burning </span>of the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">of the innermost </span>chamber, i.e., the Holy of Holies? This would contradict Rabbi Elazar’s opinion. 
The Gemara defends his opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">during the burning of the </span>incense <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Sanctuary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>how can the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> say: <span class="gemarra-regular">What higher standard </span>is applicable to the Sanctuary? This implies that it is superior only with respect to one higher standard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Are there not more? Surely, there is this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> higher standard, that whereas </span>the people <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Sanctuary remove</span> themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">both during its own, </span>i.e., the Sanctuary’s, incense <span class="gemarra-regular">burning and during the </span>incense <span class="gemarra-regular">burning of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">innermost </span>chamber, i.e., the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">but in</span> the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the Entrance Hall and the altar they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> remove </span>themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">only during the burning </span>of the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Sanctuary. </span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>in fact what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teaching: </span>It is teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">only that </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Sanctuary </span><span class="gemarra-regular">remove </span>themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">both during the burning </span>of the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>during the blood presentations, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">not during the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">burning </span>of the incense; <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the Entrance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Hall and the altar they do not remove </span>themselves, 

Daf 44b

<span class="gemarra-regular">except during</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">burning </span>of the incense. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">this higher standard, that whereas from the Sanctuary</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they remove </span>themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">both during its own sanctification, </span>i.e., the blood presentations in the Sanctuary, <span class="gemarra-regular">and during the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sanctification of the innermost </span>chamber, i.e., the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">but from </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the Entrance Hall and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the altar, they remove </span>themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">only during the sanctification of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Sanctuary. Rava said: </span>Indeed, there are numerous distinctions, but the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches only one because all the distinctions fit into <span class="gemarra-regular">one category of removal. </span>
The Gemara continues to analyze the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Just as they remove themselves from the area between the Entrance Hall and the altar during the burning of the incense, <span class="gemarra-regular">they similarly remove </span>themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">during the </span>blood <span class="gemarra-regular">presentations of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bull of the anointed priest; of the bull for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an unwitting </span>communal <span class="gemarra-regular">sin; and of the goats of idol</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> worship. From where do we </span>derive this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Pedat said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>It is derived by a verbal analogy between the word <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement </span>said in connection with those offerings and the word <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement from </span>the prohibition on <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ahava said: Learn from this </span>that there is a prohibition in the area between the Entrance Hall and the altar. The <span class="gemarra-regular">higher standards </span>applied to the various areas in the Temple are defined <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">learned them </span>as a tradition. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if it could enter your mind </span>that these standards are defined <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law, what is different </span>about the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the Entrance Hall and the altar </span>that the prohibition applies only there? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>other priests would accidentally <span class="gemarra-regular">happen</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to enter </span>the Sanctuary while incense is burning there. But if that is the reason, then the rabbinic decree should require that <span class="gemarra-regular">they remove </span>themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">also from the entire Temple</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> courtyard, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps they </span>would accidentally <span class="gemarra-regular">happen to enter. </span>The fact that the prohibition does not extend to the Temple courtyard suggests that the standards are defined by Torah law.
The Gemara rejects Rav Aḥa bar Ahava’s reasoning: The prohibition could indeed be rabbinic. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to limit it to the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the Entrance Hall and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> altar, </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since there is nothing that separates</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>from the Sanctuary, the distinction between the two areas <span class="gemarra-regular">is not conspicuous, </span>and therefore people may err and enter. But with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">Temple courtyard, since there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the outer altar that separates </span>the rest of the Temple courtyard from the Sanctuary, the distinction between the areas <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> conspicuous, </span>and therefore there is no need to extend the prohibition throughout the Temple courtyard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Learn from this </span>fact that there is a rabbinic prohibition in the area between the Entrance Hall and the altar. <span class="gemarra-regular">The sanctity of the Entrance Hall </span>and the sanctity of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Sanctuary is one matter, </span>i.e., there they share the same sanctity, and therefore the Torah prohibition applies to the Entrance Hall as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">For if it could</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enter your mind </span>to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>areas <span class="gemarra-regular">have two</span> distinct levels <span class="gemarra-regular">of sanctity, </span>it would emerge that the prohibition to be in the <span class="gemarra-regular">Entrance Hall is itself </span>a rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree. But will we arise and issue </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>prevent violation of another <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>by prohibiting being present in the area between the Entrance Hall and the altar, lest one enter the Entrance Hall itself? 
The Gemara rejects Rava’s reasoning: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this would not be a case of issuing one decree to prevent violation of another decree, because <span class="gemarra-regular">the Entrance Hall and the </span>area <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Entrance Hall and the altar </span>share <span class="gemarra-regular">one sanctity. </span>Consequently, any prohibition applied to one will certainly also apply to the other. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sanctuary and the Entrance Hall have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two </span>distinct <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctities. </span>
§ The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day, </span>a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">scoop up </span>the coals with a coal pan made <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">silver and pour </span>the coals from there <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>a coal pan <span class="gemarra-regular">of gold. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason</span> the gold pan was not used to scoop the coals? The Gemara answers: Because <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah spared the money of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Jewish people</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since the pan is worn away with use, it is preferable to use a less expensive silver pan. 
§ The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">this day, </span>on Yom Kippur, the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">scoops up with </span>a coal pan <span class="gemarra-regular">of gold, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and with </span>that coal pan, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would bring </span>the coals <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>the Holy of Holies. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the reason </span>that on Yom Kippur only one pan is used? <span class="gemarra-regular">Due to the weakness </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> He has to perform the entire service by himself while fasting; using only one pan minimizes his exertion. 
§ The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day, </span>a priest scoops up the coals with a coal pan <span class="gemarra-regular">of four </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> and pours the coals into a coal pan of three <span class="it-text">kav</span>. Rabbi Yosei says: On every other day, a priest scoops with a coal pan of a <span class="it-text">se’a</span>, which is six <span class="it-text">kav</span>, and then pours the coals into a coal pan of three <span class="it-text">kav</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Tamid</span> 33a): As he poured from a pan of four <span class="it-text">kav</span> to a pan of three <span class="it-text">kav</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of coals became scattered, and he swept them into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the cana</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> that passed through the Temple and ran to the Kidron brook.
It <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of coals was scattered. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it was taught in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> were scattered. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that </span>a single <span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> was scattered, is understandable. It is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna, who maintain that coals are poured from a coal pan of four <span class="it-text">kav</span> to one of three. <span class="gemarra-regular">But that </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span> of coals were scattered, in accordance <span class="gemarra-regular">with whose </span>opinion is it? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis and not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei. </span>According to Rabbi Yosei, three <span class="it-text">kav</span> of coals would have been scattered.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: With </span>a coal pan <span class="gemarra-regular">of two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he would bring </span>the coals <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>the Holy of Holies. If one accepts the opinion of the Rabbis that the coals were scooped with a coal pan of four <span class="it-text">kav</span>, two <span class="it-text">kav</span> were scattered. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: You can even say </span>that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and this is what he is saying: On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day, </span>a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">scooped with </span>a coal pan <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a desert </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, which </span>is five Jerusalem <span class="it-text">kav</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">he poured </span>the coals <span class="gemarra-regular">into a coal pan of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> three Jerusalem </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Therefore, two <span class="it-text">kav</span> would be scattered. 
§ The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day, </span>the coal pan <span class="gemarra-regular">was heavy, but </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">this day </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">light</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day its side was thick but </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">this day </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">soft </span>and thin. <span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day </span>its handle <span class="gemarra-regular">was short but </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">this day it was long. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? So that the arm of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest could assist hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> in carrying the coal pan, i.e., he could support the coal pan by resting it against his arm rather than bear the entire weight in his hand. 
It was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not have a ring</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day it has a ring </span>on the end of the handle, which clatters against it and makes a noise in fulfillment of the verse “And the sound thereof shall be heard when he goes in to the Sanctuary” (Exodus 28:35); this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of the son of the Deputy. </span>
§ The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day, it was </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">greenish gold </span>but on this day it was of a red gold. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: There are seven </span>types <span class="gemarra-regular">of gold </span>mentioned in the Bible: <span class="gemarra-regular">Gold, and good gold, and gold of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ophir </span>(I Kings 10:11), <span class="gemarra-regular">and glistering gold </span>(I Kings 10:18), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shaḥut</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gold </span>(I Kings 10:17), <span class="gemarra-regular">and closed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gold </span>(I Kings 10:21), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">parvayim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gold </span>(II Chronicles 3:6). The Gemara explains the reason for these names: There is a distinction between <span class="gemarra-regular">gold and good gold, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is written </span>in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the gold of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that land is good” </span>(Genesis 2:12), which indicates the existence of gold of a higher quality. <span class="gemarra-regular">Gold of Ophir </span>is gold <span class="gemarra-regular">that comes from Ophir. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Glistering</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mufaz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] gold </span>is so named 

Daf 45a

<span class="gemarra-regular">because it resembles the luster of pearls [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">paz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> in the way it glistens. <span class="gemarra-italic">Shaḥut</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gold </span>is named as such <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it is very malleable and <span class="gemarra-regular">is spun like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thread [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shenitve</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">keḥut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span><span class="it-text">Shaḥut</span> is a contraction of the words <span class="it-text">shenitve</span> <span class="it-text">keḥut</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Closed gold </span>is so called <span class="gemarra-regular">because when </span>a shop <span class="gemarra-regular">opens </span>to sell it, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">shops </span><span class="gemarra-regular">close, </span>as no one is interested in purchasing any other type of gold. <span class="gemarra-italic">Parvayim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gold </span>is so called <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>its redness <span class="gemarra-regular">resembles the blood of bulls [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">parim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: There are </span>in fact only <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>types of gold, the last five in Rav Ḥisda’s list. Gold and good gold are not independent categories; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">each </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and every one </span>of the types of gold has two varieties: Regular <span class="gemarra-regular">gold and </span>a superior variety called <span class="gemarra-regular">good gold.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> That was also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to <span class="it-text">parvayim</span> gold: <span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day </span>the coal pan was made <span class="gemarra-regular">of greenish gold, but </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">this day </span>it was made of <span class="gemarra-regular">a red </span>gold, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">parvayim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gold which resembles the blood of bulls</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day, </span>a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">peras</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>half of a <span class="it-text">maneh</span>, of incense <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">morning, </span>and a <span class="it-text">peras</span> in the afternoon, but on this day the High Priest adds an additional handful of incense and burns it in the Holy of Holies. <span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day, </span>the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>ground <span class="gemarra-regular">fine </span>as prescribed by the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">this day it was superfine. The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states with regard to the incense on Yom Kippur that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">finely ground </span>aromatic incense” (Leviticus 16:12). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse </span>mean to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>by this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Has it not already been</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: “And you shall grind some of it finely” </span>(Exodus 30:36)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, it teaches </span>that on Yom Kippur the incense has to be <span class="gemarra-regular">superfine.</span>
§ The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">On </span><span class="gemarra-regular">every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day, priests ascend on the eastern side of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the ramp. </span>A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> explains the reason for this: <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Master said: All the turns that you turn should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be only to the right, </span>which, after ascending the altar, means one will turn <span class="gemarra-regular">to the east </span>and will mean one will circulate the altar in a counter-clockwise fashion. When they descended, they again turned to the right, which is to the west of the ramp.
§ The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">this day </span>the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">ascend in the middle </span>of the ramp <span class="gemarra-regular">and descend</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the middle. What is the reason? Due to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eminence </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest </span>he should not walk on the side but in the middle.
§ We learned in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day the High </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Priest sanctifies his hands and his feet from the laver </span>like the other priests, and on this day he sanctifies them from the golden flask. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason? Due </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the eminence </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
§ The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day, there were four arrangements </span>of wood <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>upon the altar, but on this day there were five. <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sages taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were two arrangements </span>of wood on the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">this day </span>there were <span class="gemarra-regular">three: One, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">large arrangement; and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second arrangement </span>for coals <span class="gemarra-regular">for the incense; and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one, </span>the additional arrangement of wood, <span class="gemarra-regular">which they add on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that day </span>for the incense that is burned in the Holy of Holies. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day </span>there were <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>arrangements, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">this day </span>there were <span class="gemarra-regular">four</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> One, the large </span><span class="gemarra-regular">arrangement; and one, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second arrangement for the incense; and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one, for the upkeep of the fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that if the fire of the large arrangement begins to die down, wood from this arrangement may be added to it to raise the flames; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one, </span>the additional arrangement of wood <span class="gemarra-regular">that they add on that day </span>for the incense that is burned in the Holy of Holies.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: On every</span> other <span class="gemarra-regular">day there were four </span>arrangements of wood on the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">this day </span>there were <span class="gemarra-regular">five: One, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">large arrangement; and one, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second arrangement for the incense</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and one, for the upkeep of the fire; </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">one, for </span>burning <span class="gemarra-regular">the limbs and fats that were not </span>fully <span class="gemarra-regular">consumed </span>on the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>previous <span class="gemarra-regular">evening; and one, </span>the additional arrangement of wood <span class="gemarra-regular">that they add on that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day </span>for the incense that is burned in the Holy of Holies.
The Gemara analyzes the different opinions: <span class="gemarra-regular">At any rate, everyone</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>arrangements in their calculations. <span class="gemarra-regular">From where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do we </span>derive this? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “It is the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> burnt-offering on the flame on the altar all night</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Leviticus 6:2); <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the large arrangement</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>It states further: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the fire of the altar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall be kept burning thereby” </span>(Leviticus 6:2), <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>additional mention of a fire is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the second arrangement, </span>which is <span class="gemarra-regular">for the incense. And from where does Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosei </span>learn about the additional arrangement <span class="gemarra-regular">for the upkeep of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the fire? He derives it </span>from the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning thereby” </span>(Leviticus 6:5), which mentions fire for the third time. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who holds that normally there are only two arrangements, explain this third mention of a fire? <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>additional mention <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to </span>teach about <span class="gemarra-regular">the kindling </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">thin wood chips</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which were used to ignite the fires on the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda would say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that the kindling of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wood chips should </span>be done <span class="gemarra-regular">only at the top of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the altar, </span>rather than setting them alight at the bottom of the altar and carrying them up? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “And the fire upon the altar shall be kept burning</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thereby” </span>(Leviticus 6:5), which indicates that the fire that is brought there has to be lit on the altar itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an arrangement for the upkeep of the fire is made? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “And the fire upon the altar shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be kept burning thereby” </span>(Leviticus 6:5). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei </span>derive that the <span class="gemarra-regular">kindling of the wood chips </span>should be at the top of the altar? <span class="gemarra-regular">He derives it from the </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">place</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon derives it. As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the sons of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar” </span>(Leviticus 1:7), which <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches about the kindling of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">wood chips</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that it may be </span>done <span class="gemarra-regular">only by a fit priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>one who is robed <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the priestly <span class="gemarra-regular">vestments of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> service; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon said to him: </span>There is no need for a verse to teach that a priest must kindle the chips, <span class="gemarra-regular">for could it enter your mind that a non-priest </span><span class="gemarra-regular">could approach the altar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rather, </span>this verse <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>about the <span class="gemarra-regular">kindling of the wood chips, that they may be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lit only at the top of the altar. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what would <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>respond to Rabbi Shimon’s reasoning? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> was derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, I would have said </span>a non-priest could light the fire on the altar by <span class="gemarra-regular">standing on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the ground </span>below <span class="gemarra-regular">and using a bellows </span>to fan the flames on the top of the altar. Therefore, this verse <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that in all circumstances the person kindling the fire must be a priest.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And from where does Rabbi Meir </span>learn about an additional arrangement for the <span class="gemarra-regular">limbs and the fats that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were not </span>fully <span class="gemarra-regular">consumed </span>on the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>previous <span class="gemarra-regular">evening? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He derives it </span>from the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“and the fire.” </span>The apparently superfluous word “and” alludes to the existence of an additional arrangement. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis, </span>i.e., Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Yehuda, who disagree, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not expound </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“and.</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what do they do with the limbs and the fats </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that were not </span>fully <span class="gemarra-regular">consumed </span>on the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>previous <span class="gemarra-regular">evening? </span>Where are they burned? A priest <span class="gemarra-regular">returns them to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the large arrangement, </span>where the process of their burning is completed. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived that <span class="gemarra-regular">for limbs and fats that were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>fully <span class="gemarra-regular">consumed </span>on the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>previous <span class="gemarra-regular">evening, </span>

Daf 45b

<span class="gemarra-regular">that they are arranged upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the altar, and if </span>the space on the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hold them, that they are arranged upon the ramp or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon the ledge </span>that protrudes from the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">until the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> large arrangement is made </span>the following day <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are arranged </span>upon it? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “That which the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fire will consume of the burnt-offering, on the altar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Leviticus 6:3). This is taken to mean that those items that the fire already consumed are once again placed upon the altar. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir </span>expound this verse? He derives from it that if <span class="gemarra-regular">parts of a burnt-offering </span>that were already partially <span class="gemarra-regular">consumed </span>on the altar fell off the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">you should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">return them </span>to continue burning; <span class="gemarra-regular">but you do not return </span><span class="gemarra-regular">incense </span>that was <span class="gemarra-regular">consumed </span>and fell off of the inner incense altar. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Ḥananya bar Minyomi from the school </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“That which the fire will consume </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the burnt-offering on the altar” </span>(Leviticus 6:3). This teaches that if <span class="gemarra-regular">parts of a burnt-offering </span>that were partially <span class="gemarra-regular">consumed </span>fell off the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">you should return them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; but you do not return incense </span>that was partially <span class="gemarra-regular">consumed </span>and fell off the altar. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">At any rate, everyone </span>assumes there is an additional arrangement of wood <span class="gemarra-regular">that they add on that day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., Yom Kippur, for the incense that is burned in the Holy of Holies. <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>derive this? <span class="gemarra-regular">They derive it </span>from the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fire </span>upon the altar” (Leviticus 6:5). The apparently superfluous words “and the” allude to an additional fire. <span class="gemarra-regular">And even</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one who does not </span>generally <span class="gemarra-regular">expound </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“and”</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does expound </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“and the.</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> 
The Gemara notes that there is an additional mention of the altar fire, which has not yet been explained: The phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“a perpetual fire”</span>(Leviticus 6:6), <span class="gemarra-regular">for what </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> does it <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>to teach? <span class="gemarra-regular">It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is required for </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that was taught </span>in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“A perpetual fire shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be kept burnin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the altar, it shall not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">go out” </span>(Leviticus 6:6). This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches about the second arrangement</span> of wood to produce coals <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">incense, that it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>set up <span class="gemarra-regular">only on the outer altar. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived that coals of <span class="gemarra-regular">fire </span>that are taken with <span class="gemarra-regular">a coal pa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> for the incense on Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>for the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>lighting <span class="gemarra-regular">the candelabru</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> must also be from the outer altar? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a logical derivation. “Fire” is state</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to the</span> daily <span class="gemarra-regular">incense </span>offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and “fire” is stated with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>incense <span class="gemarra-regular">coal pan and the candelabrum. Just as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the case of the daily incense offering, the fire is taken from <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the outer altar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so </span><span class="gemarra-regular">too </span>here, in the case of the incense coal pan and the candelabrum, the fire should be taken from <span class="gemarra-regular">upon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the outer altar.</span>
If the matter is derived through reasoning, it is also possible to posit an alternative argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Or, </span>alternatively, one could <span class="gemarra-regular">go</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this way. “Fire” is stated with regard to the </span>daily <span class="gemarra-regular">incense </span>offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and “fire” is stated with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>incense <span class="gemarra-regular">coal pan and the candelabrum. Just as there, </span>in the case of the daily incense offering, the fire is taken from a place <span class="gemarra-regular">near to it, </span>i.e., the outer altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>in the case of the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">coal pan and the candelabrum, </span>the fire should be taken from a place <span class="gemarra-regular">near to it, </span>i.e., the inner altar.
Since there are two equally logical derivations, a verse is required to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “A perpetual fire shall be kept</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> burning on the altar, it shall not go out” </span>(Leviticus 6:6). The <span class="gemarra-regular">“perpetual fire” that I told you, </span>i.e., the fire of the candelabrum, about which the Torah states “a lamp to burn continually” (Exodus 27:20), <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>be lit <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>from a fire that is <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">top of the outer altar. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>have therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>the source for the <span class="gemarra-regular">fire for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">candelabrum. From where </span>do we derive the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> for the <span class="gemarra-regular">fire for the </span>incense <span class="gemarra-regular">coal pan </span>on Yom Kippur? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is a logical derivation. “Fire” is stated with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to </span>the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">coal pan </span>on Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">and “fire” is stated with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">candelabrum. Just </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as there, </span>in the case of the candelabrum, the fire is taken from <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the outer altar, so too, here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in the case of the incense coal pan, the fire should be taken from <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the outer altar.</span>
If the matter is derived through reasoning, it is also possible to posit an alternative argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Or, </span>alternatively, one could <span class="gemarra-regular">go this way: “Fire” is stated with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to the </span>daily <span class="gemarra-regular">incense </span>offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and “fire” is stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to the </span>incense <span class="gemarra-regular">coal pan </span>on Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>in the case of the daily incense offering, the fire is taken from a place <span class="gemarra-regular">near to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it, </span>i.e., the outer altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in the case of fire for the incense coal pan, the fire should be taken from a place <span class="gemarra-regular">near </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to it, </span>i.e., the inner altar.
Since there are two equally logical derivations, a verse is required to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he shall take a pan full of coals of fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from upon the altar from before the Lord” </span>(Leviticus 16:12). The description of the altar being “from before the Lord” suggests it is not entirely before the Lord. <span class="gemarra-regular">Which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">altar </span>is only <span class="gemarra-regular">partially before the Lord</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all of it is before the Lord, </span>i.e., part of it lies directly parallel to the Sanctuary, but part of it does not? <span class="gemarra-regular">You must say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the outer altar. </span>Only the western side of it lies parallel to the entrance to the Sanctuary. In contrast, the inner altar is entirely within the Sanctuary and so is considered entirely before the Lord.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it is necessary to write “from upon the altar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” and it is necessary to write “from before God” </span><span class="gemarra-regular">because if the Merciful One had written </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">“from upon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the altar” I would have said: What altar </span>is the verse referring to? The <span class="gemarra-regular">inner altar. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">writes “from before God.” And if the Merciful One had </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">“from before God,” I would have said </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically from </span>the part of the altar that lies <span class="gemarra-regular">before God, </span>i.e., from the northwestern corner, which lies directly parallel to the entrance of the Sanctuary; 

Daf 46a

<span class="gemarra-regular">but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from this side or from that side </span>of the altar, both of which are not directly in front of the Sanctuary’s entrance, I would <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>the fire may not be taken from there. Therefore, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to write both terms in order to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar said in the name of bar Kappara: Rabbi Meir </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would say: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">limbs of a burnt-offering </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that remained </span>on the altar from the previous night and which were not fully consumed, <span class="gemarra-regular">one should make a separate </span><span class="gemarra-regular">arrangement </span>of wood <span class="gemarra-regular">for them and arrange them </span>upon it to be burned. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is done <span class="gemarra-regular">even on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>bar Kappara <span class="gemarra-regular">teaching us </span>when he informs us that Rabbi Meir requires a separate arrangement to be made? Surely, <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>this in the mishna that cites Rabbi Meir as saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day, there were four arrangements </span>of wood <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>upon the altar. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Avin </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>Bar Kappara’s teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">is needed only </span>in order to teach the requirement to set up a fourth arrangement, even though it is only for limbs of <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified </span>offerings. As certain disqualifications apply only <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, if the offering is nevertheless brought upon the altar it should not then be removed. Bar Kappara teaches that Rabbi Meir’s ruling applies in the event that limbs of such an offering were not fully consumed. 
The Gemara qualifies this: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>this applies <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">the fire has </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">taken hold of them </span>and they have begun to burn. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the fire </span>has not yet <span class="gemarra-regular">taken hold of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them, no, </span>a separate arrangement is not made in order to burn them. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>a different version of this qualification: <span class="gemarra-regular">Both </span>with regard to the limbs of <span class="gemarra-regular">valid </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified </span>offerings, <span class="gemarra-regular">if the fire has </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">taken hold of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>and they have begun to burn, <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>a separate arrangement is made to burn them, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if </span>the fire did not take hold of them, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>a separate arrangement is not made in order to burn them. 
Bar Kappara concluded: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is done <span class="gemarra-regular">even on Shabbat. </span>But surely, <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>this in the mishna that cites Rabbi Meir as saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">this day, </span>on Yom Kippur, there are <span class="gemarra-regular">five. </span>This means that the arrangement for burning any remaining limbs is made also on Yom Kippur, despite the fact that all the Shabbat prohibitions apply. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ya’akov said: </span>Nevertheless, bar Kappara’s teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">necessary, </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">it could enter your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this applies </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">when Yom Kippur occurs after Shabbat, </span>i.e., on Sunday. Perhaps only in such a case is a separate arrangement made, based on the accepted law <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> leftover <span class="gemarra-regular">fats of Shabbat </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">are sacrificed </span>and burned <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yom Kippur. However, </span>if Yom Kippur occurs <span class="gemarra-regular">in the middle</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the week, </span>then perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>a separate arrangement is not made in order to burn them. Therefore, bar Kappara <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that Rabbi Meir’s ruling applies in all cases.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is this that does not care about his flour</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he does not truly care about what he says and speaks imprecisely? <span class="gemarra-regular">Did we </span>not <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">On every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">day. </span>This clearly implies that Rabbi Meir’s ruling applies equally to all days of the week. As such, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov’s justification for bar Kappara’s teaching is already implied in Rabbi Meir’s words in the mishna. The Gemara comments: Indeed, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara comments: Both Rava and bar Kappara hold that a separate arrangement is made even on Shabbat. This <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Huna, who said: The beginning </span>of the sacrificial service of the daily offering, i.e., its slaughter, the sprinkling of its blood, and its burning <span class="gemarra-regular">overrides </span>Shabbat; <span class="gemarra-regular">the end </span>of its service, i.e., the burning of its sacrificial parts, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not override </span>Shabbat. 
The Gemara analyzes Rav Huna’s statement: Returning to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself: Rav Huna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: The beginning </span>of the sacrificial service of the <span class="gemarra-regular">daily</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> offering overrides </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">the end </span>of its service <span class="gemarra-regular">does not override </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. 
Previously, the Gemara assumed that Rav Huna was discussing the possibility that the sacrifice of the daily offering overrides Shabbat. The Gemara now clarifies if this was his intention: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is meant by saying that the end of its service <span class="gemarra-regular">does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not override </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span>Although the end of its service <span class="gemarra-regular">does override Shabbat, it does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">override </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that it should not be brought in a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity. </span>This is true although the beginning of the sacrificial service of the daily offering may, if necessary, be brought in a state of ritual impurity. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>The end of its service <span class="gemarra-regular">overrides </span>only the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that it should not be brought in a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity, but it does not override Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>Rabba: <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span>poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty to your </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it </span>poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥisda. It </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult to your opinion </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is different </span>about the prohibition of bringing an offering in a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity </span>that the daily offering overrides it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because it is written </span>with regard to the daily offering <span class="gemarra-regular">“in its season” </span>(Numbers 28:2), to emphasize that it should be brought under all circumstances, even if that means that it will be brought <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity. </span>But, by that logic, the daily offering should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>override <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat. </span>Because the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“in its season</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>emphasizes that it should be brought under all circumstances, this means <span class="gemarra-regular">even on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda: What is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>that the daily offering overrides it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because it is written “in its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">season,” </span>to emphasize that it should be brought under all circumstances, <span class="gemarra-regular">even on Shabbat. </span>But by that logic, the daily offering should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>override the prohibition of bringing an offering in a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity. </span>Because the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its season” </span>emphasizes that it should be brought under all circumstances, this means <span class="gemarra-regular">even in </span>a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: It </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult to my </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">and it does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>pose <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. It </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult to my </span>opinion, because I hold that <span class="gemarra-regular">the end of </span>its sacrificial rite <span class="gemarra-regular">is like its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> beginning. </span>

Daf 46b

Therefore, with regard to overriding the prohibition to bring an offering in a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> beginning </span>of the sacrifice of the daily offering <span class="gemarra-regular">is fit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to override </span>the prohibition of offering it in a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity, </span>so too, <span class="gemarra-regular">its end also overrides </span>the prohibition. However, in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, the beginning</span> of a daily offering of the weekday <span class="gemarra-regular">is not fit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to override </span>Shabbat, since by definition it must be brought on its appropriate day. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">its end also does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> override </span>Shabbat in the event that limbs remain from Friday’s daily offering.
And it is also <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the </span>opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">its end is like its beginning. </span>Rather, he has the following reasoning: The prohibitions of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>are not merely overridden <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a communal </span>offering, but they are actually <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted, </span>such that there is no need to try to avoid performing the necessary labors when sacrificing it. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">its end also overrides </span>Shabbat. 
However, in the case of the prohibition to bring an offering in a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity, which is </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">overridden in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a communal </span>offering, it is preferable to avoid doing so. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the beginning of </span>its sacrifice, i.e., its slaughter and the sprinkling of its blood, and its burning, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is the essential </span>stage that provides <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement, overrides </span>the prohibition and should be done even in a state of ritual impurity. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">its end, </span>i.e., the burning of the sacrificial parts, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is not the essential </span>stage that provides <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement, does not override </span>the prohibitions. 
The Torah prohibits the fire on the altar to be extinguished: “A perpetual fire shall be kept burning on the altar, it shall not go out” (Leviticus 6:6). With regard to this prohibition, an amoraic dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> extinguishes the fir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>the coals that are taken with <span class="gemarra-regular">the coal pan </span>for the incense on Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the coals that are taken in order to light <span class="gemarra-regular">the candelabrum, Abaye said: He is liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rava said: He is not liable.</span>
The Gemara elaborates on the dispute: In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one extinguished </span>a coal while still standing <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">top of the altar, everyone agrees that he is liable. </span>This is because the verse explicitly is referring to extinguishing a flame “upon the altar.” <span class="gemarra-regular">When they disagree, </span>it is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he brought </span>the coals <span class="gemarra-regular">down to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ground </span>level <span class="gemarra-regular">and extinguished </span>a coal there. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is liable, </span>since it is still considered <span class="gemarra-regular">fire of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">altar. Rava said: He is not liable, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">once it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has been removed </span>from the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">removed </span>and no longer part of the altar’s fire. Therefore, the prohibition does not apply to it. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if so, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh said: One who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> takes down a coal from upon the altar and extinguishes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is liable, in accordance with whose </span>opinion is he ruling? Could he possibly be ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye? </span>Certainly not. In disputes between Abaye and Rava, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> follows Rava. 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span><span class="gemarra-regular">can even say </span>his ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>by making the following distinction: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the ruling of Rav Naḥman, the coal <span class="gemarra-regular">was notremoved </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to fulfill its mitzva. </span>Therefore, it is still considered to be part of the fire of the altar and the prohibition still applies. Whereas, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the dispute between Abaye and Rava, this is a case of coal that <span class="gemarra-regular">was removed to fulfill its mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, it is associated with its mitzva and no longer considered the fire of the altar. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>a different version of the dispute: 
In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he brought </span>the coals <span class="gemarra-regular">down to the ground and extinguished</span> a coal there, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees that he is not liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. When they disagree </span>it is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> extinguished </span>a coal while still standing <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the top of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the altar. Abaye said: He is liable, </span>since it is still considered <span class="gemarra-regular">fire of the altar. Rava said: He is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not liable, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">once it has been removed </span>from the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">removed </span>and no longer part of the altar’s fire. Therefore, the prohibition does not apply to it. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if so, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Avuh said: He who takes down a coal from upon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the altar and extinguishes it is liable, in accordance with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is his ruling? It would appear that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">neither in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye, nor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span>with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava. </span>The Gemara explains: You can even say that his ruling is in accordance with the opinion of Rava by making the following distinction: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the ruling of Rav Naḥman, the coal <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not removed to fulfill its mitzva; </span>it is therefore still considered to be part of the fire of the altar and the prohibition applies. Whereas, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the dispute between Abaye and Rava, this is a case of coal that <span class="gemarra-regular">was removed to fulfill its mitzva, </span>and it is therefore associated with its mitzva and no longer considered the fire of the altar.


Daf 47a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">They brought out the spoon and the coal pan </span>to the High Priest so he may perform the service of the incense. <span class="gemarra-regular">He scoops his handfuls </span>from the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">places it into the spoon. The </span>High Priest with <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>hands fills the spoon with incense in an amount <span class="gemarra-regular">corresponding </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the large </span>size of his hands, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span>High Priest with <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>hands fills the spoon with incense in an amount <span class="gemarra-regular">corresponding to the small </span>size of his hands. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this was the measure </span>of the spoon, i.e., it was made to correspond to the size of his hands. <span class="gemarra-regular">He took the coal pan in his right </span>hand <span class="gemarra-regular">and the spoon in his left </span>hand.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara expresses surprise at the statement of the mishna. In an earlier mishna, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> already <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>that the High Priest must bring the <span class="gemarra-regular">coal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pan: He takes a coal pan and ascends to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">top of the altar and rakes and descends. </span>Why does the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> mention the taking of the coal pan again? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">There </span>the mishna deals with the <span class="gemarra-regular">coal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pan of </span>burning <span class="gemarra-regular">coals, and here </span>the mishna is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">coal pan of incense, </span>which he would later scoop out. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">They brought out an empty spoon for him from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> chamber of vessels, and a coal pan heaped with incense</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the Chamber of the House of Avtinas.</span>
§ The mishna taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> scoops his handfuls </span>from the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">and places it into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the spoon. The </span>High Priest with <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>hands fills the spoon with incense <span class="gemarra-regular">corresponding to the large </span>size of his hands, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the High Priest with <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>hands fills the spoon <span class="gemarra-regular">corresponding to the small </span>size of his hands, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this was the measure </span>of the spoon, according to the size of his hands. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I</span> need <span class="gemarra-regular">a spoon on Yom Kippur? </span>After all, <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Merciful One states: </span>“And he shall take a coal pan full of coals of fire from off the altar from before the Lord, and <span class="gemarra-regular">his hands full </span>of sweet incense beaten small <span class="gemarra-regular">and bring </span>it within the veil” (Leviticus 16:12). This verse suggests that the handfuls are brought by hand rather than in a vessel. 
The Gemara answers: The High Priest uses a spoon <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is impossible </span>to perform the service otherwise. The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">As what should we do? Let him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bring in </span>the coal pan <span class="gemarra-regular">and then bring in </span>the incense? <span class="gemarra-regular">The Merciful One states one </span>act of <span class="gemarra-regular">bringing </span>for the coals and the incense, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not two </span>acts of <span class="gemarra-regular">bringing.  </span>
Instead, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him take </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">incense by his handfuls and place </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">coal pan on top of </span>his two handfuls <span class="gemarra-regular">and enter, </span>carrying it all in one go. This suggestion is also impractical, as <span class="gemarra-regular">when he arrives there, </span>in the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">what should he do? </span>How can the High Priest put down the coal pan where it is? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">coal pan in his teeth and lower </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, before a king of flesh and blood one would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not do so, </span>as it is disrespectful. <span class="gemarra-regular">All the more</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so, </span>one would not act in this manner <span class="gemarra-regular">before the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> King of kings, the Holy One, Blessed be He. </span>
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, it is impossible </span>for the High Priest to behave in another way, <span class="gemarra-regular">and since it is impossible </span>to act in any other manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">he act</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as we find </span>with regard to the sacrifices of the <span class="gemarra-regular">princes </span>during the dedication of the Tabernacle. On that occasion, the princes brought spoons filled with incense: “One golden spoon of ten shekels full of incense” (Numbers 7:14).
§ The mishna taught that the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">took the coal pan in his right </span>hand <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">spoon in his left </span>hand. The Gemara questions this arrangement by citing a well-known maxim: <span class="gemarra-regular">The native is on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the groun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the stranger is in the heavens; </span>i.e., this is the opposite of what one would expect. The main component of the mitzva is the incense, while the coal pan is required only for burning the incense. Consequently, the High priest should carry the spoon, which contains the main component of the service, in his right hand, and the accessory in his left hand. 
The Gemara explains: The service is performed in this manner for reasons of comfort, as <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>coal pan is <span class="gemarra-regular">greater </span>in weight, since it holds the coals, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>spoon of incense weighs <span class="gemarra-regular">less. And even when the two of them are equal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> when the spoon contains three <span class="it-text">kav</span> of incense <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the action of Rabbi Yishmael ben Kimḥit, </span>who could hold several <span class="it-text">kav</span> in his exceptionally large hands, nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>coal pan <span class="gemarra-regular">is hot </span>and must be held carefully in the right hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>spoon of incense <span class="gemarra-regular">is cold </span>and is easily carried in the left. 
§ Since the Gemara has mentioned Rabbi Yishmael ben Kimḥit, it discusses him further. <span class="gemarra-regular">They</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said about Rabbi Yishmael ben Kimḥit </span>that his hands were so large <span class="gemarra-regular">that he would scoop </span>up <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which he would hold <span class="gemarra-regular">by his handfuls, and say: All the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> women selected </span>the best they could for their children, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the selection of my mother rose to the roof</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., my mother chose the best. Rabbi Yishmael ben Kimḥit is referring to himself, as he matured to a great height and stature. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>he was referring to his mother’s selection <span class="gemarra-regular">of flour, in accordance with</span> the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Yonatan. As Rabba bar Yonatan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yeḥiel said: Flour is beneficial </span>and healthy <span class="gemarra-regular">for the sick. </span>Since his mother ate this flour when she was pregnant with him, her son grew heartily. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And some say</span> this reference to selection is a euphemism for semen, <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>a statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu, as Rabbi Abbahu</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raised a contradiction </span>between two verses. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is written: “For</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> You have girded me </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">vatazreni</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">with strength for battle” </span>(II Samuel 22:40), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written </span>in a parallel verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Who girds me </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">hame’azreni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] with strength” </span>(Psalms 18:33). What is the difference between these two expressions? <span class="gemarra-regular">David said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Universe: You selected me [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zeritani</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>with the best drop of semen that my mother absorbed, with which, <span class="gemarra-regular">You fashioned me [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zeraztani</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>within her. This accounts for the variant forms of this expression.
The Gemara continues to discuss Rabbi Yishmael ben Kimḥit. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said about Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yishmael ben Kimḥit: Once he was talking to a certain</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">b</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the market </span>on Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">drop </span>of saliva <span class="gemarra-regular">spraye</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>the Arab’s <span class="gemarra-regular">mouth onto</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the clothes </span>of Rabbi Yishmael, who was the High Priest at the time. This spittle rendered him ritually impure by rabbinic law, like the ritual impurity of a <span class="it-text">zav</span>, preventing him from serving in the Temple. <span class="gemarra-regular">And his brother</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yeshevav entered and served </span>as High Priest on that day <span class="gemarra-regular">in his stead. And, </span>consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">their mother saw two</span> of her sons serving as <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priests on a single</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> further said about Rabbi Yishmael ben Kimḥit: Once he went</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out and talked to a certain officer [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hegmon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the market, and a drop of saliva sprayed from </span>the officer’s <span class="gemarra-regular">mouth onto the clothes </span>of Rabbi Yishmael, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his brother Yosef entered and served </span>as High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his stead. And, </span>again, <span class="gemarra-regular">their mother saw two </span>of her sons serving as <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priests on a single day. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Kimḥit had seven sons</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and they all served </span>in the office <span class="gemarra-regular">of the High </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Priesthood, </span>as High Priests or as his substitute. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to her: What </span>good deeds <span class="gemarra-regular">did you perform to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">merit this? She said to them: In all my days, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the beams of my house never saw the braids of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">my hair, </span>as she was extremely modest and was strict about covering her hair even inside her own house. <span class="gemarra-regular">They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to her: Many </span>women <span class="gemarra-regular">did so and did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">succee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to such a degree; you must have been granted a special gift from God. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>“And he shall take up from it <span class="gemarra-regular">his handful, </span>of the fine flour of the meal-offering, and of its oil” (Leviticus 6:8). This verse teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that he should not measure an amount </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for the handfu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> of a meal-offering with a utensil, but he should separate it directly by hand. <span class="gemarra-regular">A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> as to whether the High Priest may <span class="gemarra-regular">measure an amount</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the handful </span>of incense? Must the incense also be scooped by hand? 
The Gemara explains the two sides of the dilemma: Perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the case of the handful of a meal-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>is different, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written “in his handful,” </span>which indicates that he must use his hand rather than a vessel. <span class="gemarra-regular">However here, where it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not written:  In his hands, but “and his hands full</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of sweet incense beaten small” </span>(Leviticus 16:12), perhaps this teaches that the handfuls of incense need <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be taken directly by hand, and the High Priest may use a vessel to scoop out the required amount. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived </span>by means of a verbal analogy between <span class="gemarra-regular">“full” </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">“full,” from “his handful,” </span>which is stated regarding the meal-offering. If this verbal analogy is accepted, the High Priest may likewise scoop the incense only by hand. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>an answer from the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this was the measure </span>of the spoon. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is it not </span>correct to infer from the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>although the required measure is a handful, the High Priest is not obligated to scoop with his hand, and <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he wanted to measure a different amount, he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>the incense with a vessel? The Gemara rejects this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, this is </span>what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">said; </span>this is what it means: <span class="gemarra-regular">And so too, </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">would return </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and scoop </span>the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the Holy of Holies in precisely the same manner. 
The Gemara asks: If so, I can <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>that the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">scoops </span>the incense, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> again scoops. </span>That is, after scooping once, the High Priest repeats the action and scoops again in the Holy of Holies. This issue is subject to a dispute in the Gemara below.
The Gemara rejects this claim: No; <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the mishna indeed means <span class="gemarra-regular">that if he wanted to measure a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> different amount, he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>the incense with a vessel. The language of the mishna does not conclusively prove which interpretation is correct, and it is possible that the Gemara’s previous inference from the mishna is accurate. Consequently, the issue of whether or not the High Priest scoops incense a second time in the Holy of Holies cannot be considered resolved. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>the mishna may mean <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the High Priest must <span class="gemarra-regular">take neither less nor more, </span>and therefore this statement has no bearing on the dispute with regard to his scooping.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">His handfuls” </span>(Leviticus 2:2). I <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought it should <span class="gemarra-regular">be overflowing </span>from the handful, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “His handful” </span>(Leviticus 6:8), which indicates a precise amount. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is based solely on the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handful,” </span>I <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought the priest may pinch a small amount <span class="gemarra-regular">even with </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">his fingertips, </span>not with his entire finger. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “His handfuls” </span>(Leviticus 2:2), meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">as people </span>usually <span class="gemarra-regular">take a handful, </span>i.e., with their whole hand. <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>should he perform this service? <span class="gemarra-regular">He scoops </span>by closing <span class="gemarra-regular">his three fingers over the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">palm of his hand, and takes a handful </span>from the flour of the meal-offering. 

Daf 47b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And in </span>a case of a meal-offering prepared in <span class="gemarra-regular">a pan and </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a meal-offering prepared in <span class="gemarra-regular">a deep </span><span class="gemarra-regular">container, </span>when the flour was fried before being scooped and was therefore hard, the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">smooths with his thumb </span>any flour that was overflowing <span class="gemarra-regular">above </span>his handful, <span class="gemarra-regular">and with his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> little finger </span>he smooths the flour that was pushing out <span class="gemarra-regular">below</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And this </span>precise taking of a handful of a meal-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the most <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult </span>sacrificial <span class="gemarra-regular">rite in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Temple. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This one </span>is the hardest rite, <span class="gemarra-regular">and no other? But there is pinching, </span>which is also considered extremely difficult, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there is taking </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">handful</span> of incense, another complex rite. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, this </span>taking of a handful of a meal-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the most <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult rites in the Temple. </span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Uza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’a raised a dilemma: What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the flour that remains <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the fingers <span class="gemarra-regular">of his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handfuls? </span>Is this flour considered to be part of his handful, or is it considered part of the remainder of the meal-offering? The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said </span>that with regard to the flour <span class="gemarra-regular">that is on the inside</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>toward the hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not raise the dilemma, as it</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly </span>part of <span class="gemarra-regular">the handful. </span>Likewise, with regard to the flour <span class="gemarra-regular">that is on the outside, do not raise</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the dilemma, as it </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly </span>part of the <span class="gemarra-regular">remainder</span> of the flour, like the rest of the meal-offering. 
Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dilemma be raised </span>with regard to the flour <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the inside and the outside. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the status of this flour? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yoḥanan said: Yehoshua ben Uza’a then resolved</span> his own dilemma: The flour that is <span class="gemarra-regular">between is doubtful</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and should be treated as questionable in status. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How does one perform </span>the Temple service in this doubtful case? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina said: </span>The priest <span class="gemarra-regular">first burns</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the handful by itself, and then </span>he burns the flour that was <span class="gemarra-regular">between. For if you say </span>that he should <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>burn the flour that was <span class="gemarra-regular">between, perhaps they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> remainders, and they are </span>therefore considered like <span class="gemarra-regular">remainders that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">became reduced between taking the handful and burning, </span>as the priest has taken flour from the remainders of the meal-offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Master said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">remainders that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">became reduce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> between taking the handful and the burning, one</span> may <span class="gemarra-regular">not burn the handful on their </span>account.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>that there is uncertainty as to whether or not this flour is considered part of the remainder of the meal-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">now too, </span>if the priest burns the in-between flour after burning the handful, one should <span class="gemarra-regular">apply here </span>the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whatever is partly </span>burned <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">fir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">is subject to </span>the prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">do not burn. </span>This principle states that if part of an item is burned on the altar, one who burns any other part of it, which is not designated for burning, has violated a prohibition. In this case, if the in-between flour is considered part of the remainder of the meal-offering, the priest who burns it transgresses that prohibition. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, said that </span>the priest does not burn the flour as part of the meal-offering but <span class="gemarra-regular">burns it for the purpose of wood. </span>In other words, he does not burn the flour as part of an offering but merely as fuel for the altar, which is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer. As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>“But they shall not come up <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a sweet savor </span>on the altar” (Leviticus 2:12). This verse indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not bring up </span>leaven and honey as a “sweet savor,” an offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, you </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">bring</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> up </span>leaven and honey and other materials <span class="gemarra-regular">for the purpose</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of wood. </span>
The Gemara asks: It works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eliezer, but according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who reject Rabbi Eliezer’s <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">what can be said? Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Mari said: </span>The solution is <span class="gemarra-regular">that fat </span>priests <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">handful</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of meal-offerings, as their fleshy fingers press against everything between them, and therefore no flour remains between the fingers. The Gemara states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now that you have arrived</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at this </span>conclusion, according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer as well, </span>it is appropriate <span class="gemarra-regular">that fat </span>priests should <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">handfuls </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>to avoid a situation of doubt. 
§ <span class="gemarra-italic">Bein</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">habeinayim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pashat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">umaḥatz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ufizer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">veḥishev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ba</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥafinat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaveiro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">a mnemonic </span>for the ensuing questions of Rav Pappa. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa raised a dilemma: What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">in-between </span>incense <span class="gemarra-regular">of his handfuls? </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is his dilemma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? If he derives </span>the verbal analogy between <span class="gemarra-regular">“full” </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">“full” </span>from his handfuls <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the case of the meal-offering handful, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one, and therefore the incense between his fingers is invalid. If Rav Pappa does not accept this verbal analogy, what is the basis of his dilemma? 
The Gemara explains that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa raised the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dilemma </span>as follows: When the verse states: “And <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hands full </span>of sweet incense beaten small, <span class="gemarra-regular">and bring </span>it within the veil” (Leviticus 16:12), does it mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">require </span>him to bring his handfuls, and <span class="gemarra-regular">that is </span>fulfilled here, as in practice the High Priest brought full handfuls? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps we require </span>that he must fulfill the following two commands in a similar manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> take…and he shall bring” </span>(Leviticus 16:12)? In other words, just as he must have the intention to take the flour, so too, he must intend to bring all of it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that </span>requirement <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>fulfilled here, as he did not intend to bring the extra flour between his fingers. No answer was found for this question, and the Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let it stand </span>unresolved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Pappa said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious to me </span>that the act of <span class="gemarra-regular">his handfuls </span>of a meal-offering should be performed <span class="it-text">ab initio</span> in the manner that <span class="gemarra-regular">people </span>usually <span class="gemarra-regular">take a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handful, </span>with their fingertips pointed downward. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa raised</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a dilemma: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">he took a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handful with his fingertips</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., if he first put his palm into the vessel and filled his palm with flour by extending his fingers and drawing them in? Does this invalidate the taking of the handful or not? 
Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if he took the handful with the back of his hand placed <span class="gemarra-regular">downward </span>in the vessel, and with his fingers collected the flour <span class="gemarra-regular">upward </span>into his palm? Lastly, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if he took the flour <span class="gemarra-regular">from the sides</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> by passing the back of his hand to and fro over the flour in the vessel with his fingers spread apart, so that the flour collects in his palm? As no answers were found for these dilemmas, the Gemara states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it stand </span>unresolved.
Likewise, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Pappa said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious to me </span>that when the Torah states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“His hands full” </span>(Leviticus 16:12), it means in the manner that <span class="gemarra-regular">people </span>usually <span class="gemarra-regular">fill their hands, </span>by placing the backs of their hands into the vessel and bringing their hands together. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa raised a dilemma: What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">scooped a handful</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his fingertips</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Again, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if he took a handful <span class="gemarra-regular">from downward </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">upward? What is</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if he took a handful <span class="gemarra-regular">from the side</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">he scooped a handful</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with this </span>hand <span class="gemarra-regular">and with this </span>hand <span class="gemarra-regular">and brought them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> together? </span>These questions are not answered either, and the Gemara states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let it stand </span>unresolved. 
§ Another <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">raised </span>by

Daf 48a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa: What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he stuck the handful</span> of flour <span class="gemarra-regular">onto the side of the vessel? </span>After the flour of a meal-offering has been separated, it must be placed in a vessel for burning, an action that sanctifies the flour. Rav Pappa inquires as to what the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is if the priest places the flour on the sides, instead of underneath the vessel. The Gemara clarifies the two sides of the dilemma: Do <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>the handful to be <span class="gemarra-regular">inside the vessel, and that is </span>the case here? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps we require </span>the handful to be <span class="gemarra-regular">placed properly inside </span>the vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that is not </span>fulfilled in this instance. No answer is found for this question, and the Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let it stand </span>unresolved. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar bar Rav Ashi raised </span>a similar <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">overturned the vesse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stuck </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">handful to the underside of the vessel? </span>Do <span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>the handful to be <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>requirement <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>fulfilled here, as the handful is between the sides of the vessel; <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps we require </span>it to be <span class="gemarra-regular">placed properly </span>in the vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>the case here? With regard to this question as well, the Gemara states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let it stand </span>unresolved. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa raised a dilemma: </span>Should <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handfuls to which </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">referred </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">smoothed </span>over <span class="gemarra-regular">or</span> slightly <span class="gemarra-regular">overflowing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Abba said to Rav Ashi: Come</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>an explicit statement in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The handful</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to which </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">referred </span>should be <span class="gemarra-regular">neither smoothed </span>over <span class="gemarra-regular">nor overflowing, but full, </span>without any flour spilling out. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in <span class="it-text">Zevaḥim</span> 32a: If <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood</span> of the sacrificial animal <span class="gemarra-regular">spille</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the floor </span>instead of being collected directly into a vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">collected it </span>from there into a vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is disqualified</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as it was not collected properly. Conversely, if the blood spilled <span class="gemarra-regular">from the vessel onto the floor, </span>after it was collected properly, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">collected it </span>and put it back in the vessel, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is valid. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters </span>derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages taught </span>in a halakhic midrash: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span>the anointed priest <span class="gemarra-regular">shall take from the blood of the bull” </span>(Leviticus 4:5); this means that the priest shall take <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the blood of the soul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the bull’s blood that flows from the place of slaughter as the animal dies, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not from the blood of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">skin, </span>which bleeds out when the skin is cut before the slaughter, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor from the blood squeezed </span>from an animal after the initial spurt. 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> interprets the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“from the blood of the bull,” </span>as though these words were written in a different order: <span class="gemarra-regular">Blood from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the bull, </span>i.e., the priest shall <span class="gemarra-regular">receive it </span>directly. <span class="gemarra-regular">For if it should enter your mind </span>that the letter <span class="it-text">mem</span>, which means “from” in the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“from the blood</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the bull,” </span>is limiting <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the priest received <span class="gemarra-regular">some of the blood, </span>his action is acceptable, <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t Rav Yehuda say: He who receives </span>the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">must receive all of the bloo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull, as it is stated: “And all the blood of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the bull he shall pour out on the base of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the altar” </span>(Leviticus 4:7)? This verse emphasizes that the priest must pour all of the bull’s blood, which is possible only if he has collected all of it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, learn</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the meaning of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“From the blood of the bull”? </span>It means that the priest must <span class="gemarra-regular">receive </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">blood </span>directly <span class="gemarra-regular">from the bull. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">subtract and add </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and interpret homiletically</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., one may take a letter from one word, insert it into a second word, and explain the phrase in that manner. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Pappa raised a dilemma </span>based on the above ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">the incense from his handfuls scattered</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Is <span class="gemarra-regular">his hand considered like the neck of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">animal, and </span>the incense is <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified? Or perhaps </span>his hand <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered like a vessel used in the Temple service, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>if the incense fell from his hand <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not disqualified. </span>No answer was found for this question either, and the Gemara again concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let it stand </span>unresolved.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa raised </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">thought </span>a disqualifying thought <span class="gemarra-regular">during</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the taking of the handful of the incense, </span>e.g., if he intended to burn it after its appropriate time? Does this thought invalidate the rite or not? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived </span>by means of a verbal analogy of <span class="gemarra-regular">“handfuls” </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">“handfuls,” from </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a meal-offering, </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>with regard to the meal-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">thought is effective </span>to invalidate <span class="gemarra-regular">it, so too </span>here, with regard to taking a handful of incense, <span class="gemarra-regular">thought is effective </span>to invalidate <span class="gemarra-regular">it? Or</span> should the two cases <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be compared? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shimi bar Ashi said to Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Pappa: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to your dilemma: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Akiva added the handful </span>of fine flour <span class="gemarra-regular">and the incense</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the frankincense, and the coals </span>that are collected in a vessel, to the ruling of the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">that if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one who immersed himself during the day touched part of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he disqualifies all of them. </span>Due to the respect in which sacred objects are held, these objects are treated as one solid unit. This is so despite the fact that its parts are not really attached to each other but are separate small segments and therefore, logically, one who immersed himself during the day should disqualify only those parts of the item with which he came into direct contact. 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">It enters your mind</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who immersed himself during</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the day disqualifies </span>these items by touch, therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">leaving </span>them after their permitted time <span class="gemarra-regular">likewise disqualifies </span>them; <span class="gemarra-regular">and from </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">leaving </span>them after their time <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualifies </span>them, therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">thought likewise disqualifies </span>them. Consequently, as incense is similar to flour with regard to ritual impurity, it is also disqualified by the priest’s improper thought. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa raised </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: </span>

Daf 48b

<span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if he <span class="gemarra-regular">thought </span>invalidating thoughts during <span class="gemarra-regular">the raking of the coals</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Does this thought invalidate the incense? The Gemara elaborates: The question here is whether <span class="gemarra-regular">actions that facilitate </span>the performance of <span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are considered like the mitzva </span>itself. If so, merely raking the coals, which facilitates the mitzva of the incense, is like burning the incense itself; therefore, an improper thought would disqualify the incense. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>perhaps actions that facilitate the performance of a mitzva are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered part of the mitzva itself. No answer was found for this question either, and the Gemara once again concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let it stand </span>unresolved.
§ The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet: What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying </span>the blood in one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">left </span>hand? Is this action valid, or is carrying, like receiving and sprinkling the blood, an act that must be performed with the right hand? Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the m: We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> there is an answer to this question from the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">He took the coal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pan in his right </span>hand <span class="gemarra-regular">and the spoon in his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">left </span>hand. This proves that although the spoon is carried in the left hand to the place of the service, the rite is valid. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let us resolve </span>this dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">for them from that which we learned </span>in a mishna: The priest who is privileged to carry the head and the leg of the daily offering to the ramp carried <span class="gemarra-regular">the right leg </span>in his <span class="gemarra-regular">left </span>hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">with its </span>entire <span class="gemarra-regular">hide </span>facing <span class="gemarra-regular">outward </span>and the place of the slaughter on the neck facing the priest. This mishna also proves that carrying with the left hand is acceptable. 
The Gemara rejects this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the proof is <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I would have said: That applies </span>only to a type of <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying that does not invalidate atonement, </span>as even if the limbs are not carried up to the altar, atonement is nevertheless achieved through the sprinkling of the blood. The rite is valid even if the limbs of the daily offering are not burned at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, with regard to</span> the type of <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying that does invalidate atonement, </span>e.g., carrying the blood to the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>perhaps it must be done specifically with the right hand. Rav Sheshet therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>from the mishna that although carrying the spoon is necessary for the mitzva, the rite is nevertheless valid if it is carried in the left hand. 

Daf 49a

The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to receiving, carrying, or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling </span>blood, if <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-priest, a mourner </span>on his first day of mourning, <span class="gemarra-regular">a drunk </span>priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blemished </span>priest, performed the rite, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified. And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> likewise </span>if the priest was <span class="gemarra-regular">sitting, and likewise </span>if he performed one of these rites with his <span class="gemarra-regular">left </span>hand, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified. </span>This statement contradicts the ruling of Rav Sheshet. The Gemara concludes: This is indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation, </span>and Rav Sheshet’s opinion is rejected. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t Rav Sheshet </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who objected </span>on the basis of this very <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Sheshet said to the interpreter of Rav Ḥisda: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Raise the </span>following <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma before Rav Ḥisda: What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying </span>the blood performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">non-priest? He said to him: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a verse supports me: “And they slaughtered the Paschal offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the priests sprinkled with their hand, and the Levites</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> flayed” </span>(II Chronicles 35:11). This verse indicates that the priests took the blood from the hands of the Levites, from which it can be inferred that the Levites carried the blood from the place of slaughtering to the place of sprinkling. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Sheshet objected </span>based on the aforementioned <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to receiving, carrying, or sprinkling </span>blood, if <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-priest, a mourner </span>on his first day of mourning, <span class="gemarra-regular">a drunk </span>priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a blemished </span>priest, performed the rite, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified. </span>This statement proves that carrying cannot be performed by a non-priest. Since Rav Sheshet himself cited this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in his objection, he was certainly familiar with it. How, then, could he issue a ruling in contradiction to the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>?
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">After </span>Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">heard </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that was cited against his opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">he objected </span>to the ruling of Rav Ḥisda from that same <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. At first Rav Sheshet was unaware of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which is why he ruled against it, but when he learned it, he relied upon it to object to Rav Ḥisda’s statement. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rav Ḥisda cite a verse </span>in support of his opinion? How can a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> contradict a verse? The Gemara answers: The verse does not mean that the Levites walked with the blood, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">that they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> acted like benche</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> and merely stood holding the bowls of blood in their hands.
§ The Gemara returns to the issue of appropriate methods for taking handfuls of incense. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raised a dilemma: What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>priest <span class="gemarra-regular">scoope</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and placed </span>the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">into the hands </span>of the High Priest? The Gemara clarifies the two sides of the question: Do <span class="gemarra-regular">we require: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">His full hands,” and that is </span>fulfilled here, as in practice the High Priest has a handful of incense? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we require </span>that the High Priest must fulfill the mitzvot: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall take…and he shall bring” </span>(Leviticus 16:12), <span class="gemarra-regular">and that is not </span>the case here, as the High Priest did not scoop and take the incense himself? This question was also left unanswered, and the Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let it stand </span>unresolved.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> raised a dilemma: </span>If the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">scooped and died</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the possibility <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> another </span>High Priest may replace him and <span class="gemarra-regular">enter with his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> handful? </span>May the second priest enter the Holy of Holies with the incense that the first priest scooped, or must he start from the beginning of the process? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>to his students in excitement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come and see </span>that Sages from a later generation were able to ask a difficult question on par with <span class="gemarra-regular">the question of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">earlier </span>generations. Even I, Rabbi Ḥanina, asked this same question, which was posed by my elder, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi. 
The Gemara analyzes this comment: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that to say that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">older </span>than Rabbi Ḥanina, which is why Rabbi Ḥanina referred to him as an early Sage? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Yehoshua </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Levi say: Rabbi Ḥanina permitted me to drink cres</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> juice on Shabbat </span>for medicinal purposes. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s deference to Rabbi Ḥanina shows that Rabbi Ḥanina was older than him. 
Since it has been raised, the Gemara addresses the issue of cress juice on Shabbat: Did Rabbi Ḥanina permit him <span class="gemarra-regular">to drink </span>cress juice? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that it is permitted to drink this juice; why would it be prohibited? <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">All </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">food </span>that healthy people eat <span class="gemarra-regular">may be eaten by people </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">for medicinal </span>purposes, and one may likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">drink all drinks </span>for medicinal purposes, as the Sages did not include these in their decree against taking medicine on Shabbat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s </span>question was: Is it permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to grind and drink</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cress on Shabbat? </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? If </span>it involves a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is danger </span>to life, and this is the prescribed cure, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted; and if </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no danger, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>as labor on Shabbat. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the question concerns a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>a life-threatening <span class="gemarra-regular">danger, and this is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma that he raised before him: Does </span>this drink <span class="gemarra-regular">heal, </span>which would mean <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is appropriate <span class="gemarra-regular">to violate Shabbat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for it, or </span>does it <span class="gemarra-regular">not heal, and </span>therefore one should <span class="gemarra-regular">not violate Shabbat for it? </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if this was not a halakhic question but a medical one, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is different </span>about this question that led him to ask it specifically of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina? </span>The Gemara explains: Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi asked Rabbi Ḥanina <span class="gemarra-regular">because he is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an expert in medicines, as Rabbi Ḥanina said: No man</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ever consulted me about a wound </span>inflicted by a <span class="gemarra-regular">white</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and recovered. </span>This shows that people came to Rabbi Ḥanina for medical advice. 
The Gemara expresses surprise at this claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">But we see that </span>people who are kicked by mules <span class="gemarra-regular">do survive. </span>The Gemara answers that instead it should <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>No man ever consulted me about a wound of this kind <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the wound <span class="gemarra-regular">survives, </span>i.e., the wound never heals. The Gemara challenges this statement as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">But we see that </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">does heal. </span>The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">We say </span>that the wound will never heal only <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the mules <span class="gemarra-regular">are red and the tops of their legs </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are white. </span>
The Gemara returns to its previous question. <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span><span class="gemarra-regular">any event, </span>one can <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from this </span>discussion <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanina </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">olde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> than Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi. Why, then, does Rabbi Ḥanina refer to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi as a member of an earlier generation? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>we must explain that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">he said, </span>i.e., that Rabbi Ḥanina’s statement should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Their question</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is like the question of the early ones</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, Rabbi Ḥanina meant that this question, posed by a member of a later generation, is as difficult as that of the early Sages.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did Rabbi Ḥanina </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say that </span>this question, of one High Priest using the incense scooped by another, was difficult to answer? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Ḥanina say: </span>“With this Aaron shall come into the sacred place, <span class="gemarra-regular">with a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bull” </span>(Leviticus 16:3); this means that the High Priest must enter <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the offering of <span class="gemarra-regular">a bull and not with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the blood of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull? </span>In other words, the High Priest himself must slaughter his bull. Should a different priest slaughter the bull, receive its blood, and then die, the priest who replaces him may not enter the Holy of Holies with the blood of the bull slaughtered by his predecessor. Instead, he must bring a new bull, slaughter it, collect its blood, and take that blood inside.
And likewise, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina said: </span>If the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">scooped the incense</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before the slaughtering of the bull, he did nothing, </span>as the handful of incense must be taken after the slaughter of the bull. If so, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina, it is impossible for a priest to enter the Sanctuary with the handful taken by his fellow priest. The reason is that if the first priest died after the handful was taken, he certainly has not yet entered with the blood he collected from the bull. Consequently, his slaughter was not effective for the substitute priest, who must repeat the entire service from the slaughter onward. 
The Gemara explains that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what Rabbi Ḥanina <span class="gemarra-regular">said: From</span> the fact that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <span class="gemarra-regular">raised this dilemma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it can be understood <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that he holds </span>that the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“with a bull” </span>means that the High Priest may enter the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">even with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blood of a bull. </span>This means that the second priest does not have to go back and slaughter a second bull. <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to that which </span>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains, his question is like the question of the earlier</span> generations. Although the question does not arise according to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina himself, according to the ruling of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, the question is indeed a difficult one.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>halakhic conclusion <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>reached <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>this matter? What in fact is the ruling in a situation where the High Priest took a handful of incense and then died? May the newly appointed High Priest use the handful that has already been scooped, or does he require a new handful? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The resolution of this question depends on a different problem. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">scoops </span>the handful when he takes the incense from the coal pan, and<span class="gemarra-regular"> again scoop</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> a handful in the Holy of Holies, this would mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>priest may <span class="gemarra-regular">enter with the handful </span>of the first High Priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">scooping </span>the handful has been <span class="gemarra-regular">fulfilled. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the High Priest does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">scoop and again scoop, let the dilemma be raised. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rav Pappa: On the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contrary, if </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">scoops and again scoops, another </span>priest should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">enter with his handful,</span> as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is impossible </span>that the new handful <span class="gemarra-regular">will be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> neither less nor more </span>than the amount of the first handful, which means the handful will not have been taken properly. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he does not scoop and again</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> scoop, let the dilemma be raised, </span>as the mitzva of taking a handful has already been fulfilled by the first priest, and the second priest has merely to place the incense on the coals. 
The Gemara explains the background to this problem. <span class="gemarra-regular">As a dilemma was raised</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before </span>the Sages: Does the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">scoop </span>a handful from the incense once <span class="gemarra-regular">and again scoop a handful </span>a second time in the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>does he <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>scoop a second time? The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to this dilemma from the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">This was the measure </span>of the spoon. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>correct to infer from the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its measure </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">on the outside, so is its measure </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on the inside, </span>i.e., there is no need to scoop another handful, as this is its fixed measure that he pours onto the coal pan. 
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>that is not necessarily the correct interpretation of the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">that if he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wants to measure </span>a precise <span class="gemarra-regular">amount </span>for his handful, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may measure </span>with a utensil for this purpose. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>it could mean <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he may take <span class="gemarra-regular">neither less nor more</span> than the measure he initially took. Consequently, there is no proof from the mishna with regard to whether the High Priest must scoop a second handful. 
The Gemara further suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to this dilemma from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: 

Daf 49b

<span class="gemarra-regular">How should </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">act </span>in the Holy of Holies, when he needs to place the incense on the coals by taking a handful from the spoon and placing it in his hands? After he places the coal pan on the ground, <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds the</span> front of <span class="gemarra-regular">the ladle, </span>i.e., the spoon of incense, <span class="gemarra-regular">with his fingertips, and some say </span>he holds it <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his teeth. </span>At this stage the handle of the spoon rests between his arms. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>he pushes it and <span class="gemarra-regular">raises</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">up </span>slowly <span class="gemarra-regular">with his thumb </span>toward his body <span class="gemarra-regular">until</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it reaches between his elbows, </span>which he then uses to turn it over. <span class="gemarra-regular">He then returns </span>the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">into his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> palms, </span>after which he pours it from his hands into the coal pan. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he heaps </span>the incense into a pile on the coals <span class="gemarra-regular">so that its smoke rises</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> slowly. And some say </span>he does the opposite, that <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> scatters it so that its smoke rises quickly. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>taking of a handful of incense <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the most <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult </span>sacrificial <span class="gemarra-regular">rite in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Temple. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This one </span>is the hardest rite, <span class="gemarra-regular">and no other? But there is pinching, </span>which is also considered extremely difficult; <span class="gemarra-regular">and there is taking a handful </span>of a meal-offering, another complex rite. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, this </span>taking of a handful of incense <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the most <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rites in the Temple, </span>rather than the single most difficult one. In any event, you can <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from this </span>that the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">scoops </span>a handful <span class="gemarra-regular">and again scoops.</span> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from this </span>that it is so.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: If a High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered </span>the bull <span class="gemarra-regular">and died</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to whether <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>High Priest may <span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span>the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">with the blood </span>of the bull that his predecessor slaughtered? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that the verse: “With this Aaron shall come into the sacred place, <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a bull” </span>(Leviticus 16:3) teaches that the priest must enter with the blood of a bull, but it need not necessarily be the blood of the bull he himself slaughtered, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in that case he may enter <span class="gemarra-regular">even with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bloo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a bull </span>slaughtered by someone else? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>the verse should be interpreted precisely: <span class="gemarra-regular">“With a bull</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” and not with the blood of a bull </span>slaughtered by another?
The Sages disputed this matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina says: “With a bull,” and not with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blood of a bull, </span>which means that the newly appointed High Priest must slaughter another bull, as he can enter only with the blood of a bull he himself slaughtered. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Reish Lakish said: “With a bull,” and even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with the blood of a bull. </span>Likewise, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami said: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">With a bull” and not with the blood of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bull; Rabbi Yitzḥak said: “With a bull,” and even with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the blood of a bull. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami raised an objection to Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa, </span>the smith: To join a group of people who arranged to partake together of a single Paschal offering, individuals may <span class="gemarra-regular">register </span>as part of a group <span class="gemarra-regular">and they </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">withdra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>and join another group <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">is slaughtered</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And if it is so, </span>that the blood of an animal is considered part of the offering, this <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who authored this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">should have said </span>that they may withdraw <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">is sprinkled. </span>If, as you maintain, the blood of an offering is part of the offering itself, why can’t a person register to or withdraw from a group of a Paschal offering until its blood is sprinkled? 
He answered him: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is different there, as it is written: </span>“And if the household is too small <span class="gemarra-regular">for a lamb</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mehiyot</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">miseh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>he and his neighbor who is next to his house” (Exodus 12:4). The phrase “<span class="it-text">mehiyot</span> <span class="it-text">miseh</span>” is read as <span class="gemarra-italic">meiḥiyutei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">deseh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>from the life of a lamb. In other words, one can withdraw from a group only as long as the lamb is alive. If so, its blood is not considered part of the Paschal lamb by a special decree of the Torah, which does not apply to Yom Kippur. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra raised </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an objection: And one may not redee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> a male firstborn donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">with a calf, nor with an undomesticated animal, nor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with a slaughtered </span>lamb, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor with an animal with a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> condition that will cause it to die within twelve months</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], nor with </span>the product of the prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">crossbreedin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> of a lamb and a goat, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor with a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">koy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a kosher animal with characteristics of both a domesticated animal and a non-domesticated animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">but with a lamb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This proves that a slaughtered animal is not considered a lamb. The Gemara rejects this claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is different there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as </span>that <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">derives </span>a verbal analogy of <span class="gemarra-regular">“lamb” </span>(Exodus 13:13) and <span class="gemarra-regular">“lamb” </span>(Exodus 12:4) <span class="gemarra-regular">from the Paschal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> offering: </span>Just as a slaughtered lamb cannot be used for a Paschal offering, the same applies to the case of a firstborn donkey.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>so, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as there, </span>the Paschal offering must be <span class="gemarra-regular">male, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unblemished, and a year old, so too here, </span>for the redemption of a firstborn donkey, one should be obligated to use <span class="gemarra-regular">a male </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">unblemished and a year old. </span>Therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: </span>“And every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you shall not redeem it, then you shall break its neck” (Exodus 13:13). The repetition of: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall redeem,” “you shall </span>not <span class="gemarra-regular">redeem,” </span>serves to <span class="gemarra-regular">amplify </span>the definition of the offering and include other animals as acceptable for this redemption, not merely those fit for the Paschal offering. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the phrases <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall redeem” “you shall redeem” </span>serve to <span class="gemarra-regular">amplify</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, even all </span>animals should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be fit for the redemption of a firstborn donkey, including a calf, undomesticated beast, a slaughtered animal, and the other exceptions listed above. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, what purpose does </span>the verbal analogy of <span class="gemarra-regular">“lamb” serve? </span>Rather, it is evident that certain animals are included while others are excluded. In any case, it is clear that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the blood of the bull on Yom Kippur cannot be derived from here. 

Daf 50a

§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yitzḥak Nappaḥa raised an objection to Rabbi Ami: “And he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall remove the entire bull </span>outside the camp” (Leviticus 4:12). This verse speaks of a bull that has been slaughtered and its fats and sacrificial parts have been burned, which proves that even after it has been slaughtered, it is still called a bull. Rabbi Ami replied: The animal itself is not called a bull at this stage; rather, it means <span class="gemarra-regular">that he should remove the entire </span>carcass, all that remains of the bull. 
The Gemara raises another difficulty by citing a verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the bull of the sin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offering and the goat of the sin-offering, </span>whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Sanctuary, shall be taken outside the camp” (Leviticus 16:27). Once again, the verse proves that even after it has been slaughtered and its blood is brought into the Holy of Holies, the animal is still called a bull. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Everyone agrees that </span>when it is intact, <span class="gemarra-regular">with its hide</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, its flesh, and its excrement, </span>it is called a bull. <span class="gemarra-regular">When they disagree </span>is with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">blood. One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sage holds </span>that its <span class="gemarra-regular">blood is called a bull, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one Sage holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">blood </span>alone <span class="gemarra-regular">is not called a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bull. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is reasonable </span>to say <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">blood is called </span>part of the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written: “With this Aaron shall come into the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sacred place, with a bull” </span>(Leviticus 16:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he brings </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in, </span>to the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">with its horns? Rather, </span>he enters <span class="gemarra-regular">with its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blood, and </span>yet the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">calls that “a bull.” </span>This proves that the blood itself is called a bull. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> other one, </span>who maintains that blood is not called a bull, how does he interpret this verse? The Gemara answers that he can explain the verse as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did Aaron become qualified to enter the sacred place? With</span> his bringing of <span class="gemarra-regular">a young bull for a sin-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>However, the blood itself, which he brings inside, is not called a bull. 
§ The Gemara returns to the issue of a replacement High Priest entering with the blood of the first bull: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let him derive </span>the answer to this problem from the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is a sin-offering whose owners </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have died</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> After all, the bull of the first High Priest is a sin-offering and its owner has died. Since there is a principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whose owners have died is left to die</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> this should resolve the dilemma. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravin bar Rav Adda said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rava: Your students say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Amram said </span>that the sin-offering bull of the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">is a communal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offering, </span>as the High Priest brings it both on his own behalf and for his fellow priests, and a communal sin-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">is not left to die. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Temura</span> that <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> debate which offerings override Shabbat and ritual impurity. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir said to him: But </span>consider <span class="gemarra-regular">the Yom</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Kippur bull, and the meal-offering resembling a wafer </span>brought specially by the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Paschal offering, </span>each of which <span class="gemarra-regular">is an individual offering and overrides Shabbat and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ritual impurity. </span>Since Rabbi Meir says that these are individual offerings, is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>correct to say <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there is one who says that </span>these offerings are <span class="gemarra-regular">communal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>
The Gemara rejects this proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your reasoning, </span>consider <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>there: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’akov said to him: But </span>there are the cases of the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull for an unwitting communal sin, and the goats</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>a sin of <span class="gemarra-regular">idolatry</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival peace</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offering, which </span>are all <span class="gemarra-regular">communal offerings and override neither Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor ritual impurity. </span>According to the above reasoning, it can be claimed <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that there is one who says</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>these are <span class="gemarra-regular">individual </span>offerings, which is incorrect. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">responded to the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as he heard him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>in the form of a general principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">Communal sacrifices</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> override Shabbat and ritual impurity, but individual sacrifices override neither</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shabbat nor ritual impurity. </span>In response to this claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meir said to him: </span>Is this statement with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an individual offering </span>a general <span class="gemarra-regular">principle? But </span>consider <span class="gemarra-regular">the Yom</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Kippur bull, and the meal-offering resembling a wafer </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">High Priest, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Paschal offering, </span>each of which <span class="gemarra-regular">is an individual offering and overrides Shabbat and ritual </span><span class="gemarra-regular">impurity.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Ya’akov responded to </span>the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> from a different perspective: Is this statement with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">communal offering </span>a general <span class="gemarra-regular">principle, </span>which overrides ritual impurity? <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> there are the cases of the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull for an unwitting</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> communal sin, and the goats for </span>a sin of <span class="gemarra-regular">idolatry</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and the <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival peace-offering, which </span>are all <span class="gemarra-regular">communal offerings</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and override neither Shabbat nor ritual impurity. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, grasp this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> principle: Any </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">a fixed tim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> for its sacrifice <span class="gemarra-regular">overrides Shabbat and ritual impurity even if </span>it is an <span class="gemarra-regular">individual </span>offering; <span class="gemarra-regular">and any </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">of no fixed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">time overrides neither Shabbat nor ritual impurity, and </span>this is the case <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if it <span class="gemarra-regular">is a communal </span>offering. With regard to the issue at hand, as the emphasis of both Rabbi Meir’s and Rabbi Ya’akov’s statements is whether the offerings they referred to override Shabbat and ritual impurity, not their classification as individual or communal offerings, nothing can be inferred from their comments in this regard. Consequently, it remains possible that the bull of the High Priest is an individual offering.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">objection to </span>Rava: Is the bull of the High Priest an individual offering? But we learned in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">goat of Yom Kippur </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that were lost</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he separated others in their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stead, </span>and the first animals were subsequently found, <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of the second set <span class="gemarra-regular">shall </span>be left to <span class="gemarra-regular">die. And likewise, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">goats for </span>a sin of <span class="gemarra-regular">idolatry that were lost and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he separated others in their stead, all of them shall </span>be left to <span class="gemarra-regular">die. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say: They shall </span>be left to <span class="gemarra-regular">graze until they become unfit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whereupon <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are sold and their proceeds go </span>for a <span class="gemarra-regular">free-will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering, as a communal sin-offering is not </span>left to <span class="gemarra-regular">die. </span>This proves that the Yom Kippur bull is called a communal sin-offering. 
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">What bull </span>is referred to here? A <span class="gemarra-regular">bull for an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> unwitting communal sin. </span>Abaye retorted: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Of Yom Kippur, </span>which clearly indicates that it is referring to the bull of Yom Kippur. Rava answered: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span>Of Yom Kippur, he was referring only <span class="gemarra-regular">to the goat. </span>That is, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> should be read as follows: The communal bull and the goat of Yom Kippur, which is also a communal offering. 
Abaye further asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the bull of Yom Kippur and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">goat of Yom Kippur that were lost and he separated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">others in their stead, </span>and the first animals were subsequently found, <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of the second set <span class="gemarra-regular">shall </span>be left to <span class="gemarra-regular">die. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Elazar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Shimon say: They shall </span>be left to <span class="gemarra-regular">graze </span><span class="gemarra-regular">until they become unfit, </span>whereupon <span class="gemarra-regular">they are sold and their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">proceeds go </span>for a <span class="gemarra-regular">free-will offering, as a communal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offering is not </span>left to <span class="gemarra-regular">die. </span>This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> explicitly states that the bull of Yom Kippur is considered a communal offering.
Rava answered him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not say: As a communal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sin-offering is not </span>left to <span class="gemarra-regular">die. Rather, say: As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a sin-offering of partners is not </span>left to <span class="gemarra-regular">die</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since some of the partners are still alive, the sin-offering is not left to die. The bull of the High Priest on Yom Kippur is considered a sin-offering of partners because it atones not only for the High Priest, but for his fellow priests, as well. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if ultimately the bull is not left to die, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">practical difference </span>whether the bull of the High Priest is considered a communal sin-offering or a sin-offering of partners? Why did Rava insist on calling it a sin-offering of partners? 
The Gemara answers <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>there is a difference between these two categories with regard to a court that issues an incorrect ruling to an entire community, e.g., a tribe of Israel, and the people act in accordance with that ruling. The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case is that the court must bring a bull for an unwitting communal sin. Rava insisted on referring to the bull that atones for all of the priests on Yom Kippur as a sin-offering of partners, not a communal sin-offering, for the following reason: If a court composed of priests issued a mistaken ruling, and the priests acted in accordance with that teaching, the <span class="gemarra-regular">priests do not bring</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a bull for </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">ruling</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as they are not considered a community but a large partnership. 
The Gemara offers another solution to the question. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear, as Rabbi Elazar raised</span> the following <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: </span>

Daf 50b

According <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Rabbi Meir, <span class="gemarra-regular">who says</span> that the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull of Yom Kippur </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">an individual, </span>can one <span class="gemarra-regular">perform substitution </span>for this animal <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>can one <span class="gemarra-regular">not perform substitution </span>in this case? In other words, if the High Priest violated a prohibition and designated a substitute by saying that this bull should be switched with another, does the substitution take effect or not? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>correct to say <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference </span>from the wording of Rabbi Elazar’s dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">that there is one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who says that </span>these offerings are <span class="gemarra-regular">communal? </span>
The Gemara rejects this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this is no proof, as one can say <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that there is one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who says that </span>these offerings are <span class="gemarra-regular">of partners. </span>There is no definitive proof that the bull of Yom Kippur is a communal sacrifice. In any event, the question of why the bull is not invalidated upon the death of the High Priest has been resolved, as the reason is either because it is a communal sacrifice or because it is a sacrifice of partners. 
§ Since the Gemara has mentioned Rabbi Elazar’s dilemma, the Gemara addresses <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter itself. Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar asked: </span>According <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Rabbi Meir, <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull of Yom Kippur </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">an individual offering, </span>can one <span class="gemarra-regular">perform substitution </span>for this animal <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>can one <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perform substitution? </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the dilemma he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is raising? </span>What is the basis of his inquiry?
The Gemara suggests that his dilemma is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we follow</span> the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who consecrates </span>the animal, i.e., the High Priest, as he was the one who paid for it, in which case it is considered an individual sacrifice and his substitution is effective? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or do we follow </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who seeks atonemen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> by the offering, and as this bull atones both for the High Priest and the entire community of his fellow priests, it is considered a communal sacrifice, and therefore his substitution is not effective? The question is: Which party is followed for the purposes of substitution?
The Gemara expresses surprise at this possible interpretation of Rabbi Elazar’s dilemma: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious that we follow </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who seeks atonement, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Abbahu said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who consecrates </span>his animal for an offering but intends it for someone else’s atonement, if he subsequently redeems the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">he adds a fift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> to it. This is in accordance with the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that one who redeems an animal that he himself dedicated must add a fifth of its value to the redemption, whereas if the person for whom it atones redeems it, he does not add a fifth. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the one for whom </span>the sacrifice <span class="gemarra-regular">atones </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">perform substitutio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for it, </span>whereas the one who consecrated the animal cannot effect substitution, as he is not considered its owner for the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of substitution. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>likewise, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who separates </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from his </span>wheat <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the wheat <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> to spare his friend from having to separate his own <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, although the friend’s produce is now exempt from the obligation of <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, the <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit of discretio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is his, </span>the one who separated the <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. The one who separated the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> is entitled to determine which priest receives the <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, despite the fact that the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> was separated for the crop of another. Similarly, when someone consecrates an animal for another person, it is the one who gains atonement that can perform substitution. If so, there is no place for Rabbi Elazar’s dilemma.
The Gemara rejects this suggested explanation of Rabbi Elazar’s dilemma: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious to </span>Rabbi Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we follow </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who seeks atonement </span>by the offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this is his dilemma: </span>Do <span class="gemarra-regular">his fellow priests achieve </span><span class="gemarra-regular">atonement by the essence </span>of the offering, i.e., part of the offering is sacrificed on their behalf, which means they are partners in the bull? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps they achieve </span><span class="gemarra-regular">atonement incidentally</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> while the main atonement is that of the High Priest. If the atonement of the other priests is merely incidental, the High Priest can effect substitution with this bull. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to this dilemma: There is <span class="gemarra-regular">a stricture </span>that applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>initial <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrifice, beyond </span>the strictures that apply <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>designated <span class="gemarra-regular">substitute</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a stricture </span>that applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to the substitution, beyond </span>the strictures that apply <span class="gemarra-regular">to the sacrifice. </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> elaborates: There is <span class="gemarra-regular">a stricture </span>that applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>initial <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrifice,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>the sanctity of <span class="gemarra-regular">the sacrifice applies to an individual</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>it does <span class="gemarra-regular">to a community, and </span>the sacrifice <span class="gemarra-regular">overrides Shabbat and ritual impurity, </span>and one can <span class="gemarra-regular">perform substitution </span>for the original sacrifice, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is not </span>the case with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to the substitute, </span>to which these halakhot do not apply.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: There is <span class="gemarra-regular">a stricture </span>that applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to the substitute beyond </span>the strictures that apply <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>initial <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrifice, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the sanctity of the <span class="gemarra-regular">substitution takes effect </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">on a permanently </span><span class="gemarra-regular">blemished animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>the substitute <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot vacate </span>its sanctified status and assume <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred </span>status; that is, it may only be sacrificed as an offering and eaten but under no circumstance can it be redeemed for its wool <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be sheared and to be worked, which is not </span>the case with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>initial <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrifice, </span>as it can be redeemed in certain situations.
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">this sacrifice? </span>What exactly is the sacrifice referred to in this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>it is the sacrifice <span class="gemarra-regular">of an individual, does </span>the sacrifice of an individual <span class="gemarra-regular">override Shabbat and ritual impurity? Rather, </span>if you say that we are dealing with the sacrifice <span class="gemarra-regular">of a community, can </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">perform substitution </span>for a communal sacrifice? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>the case that we are dealing here <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">bull, </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">overrides Shabbat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and ritual impurity, as </span>it is a sacrifice <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">a fixed time? And </span>likewise, one can <span class="gemarra-regular">perform substitution </span>for this offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is an offering </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">an individual. </span>This interpretation resolves Rabbi Elazar’s dilemma. 
The Gemara rejects this contention. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: No, </span>this is no proof, as it can be claimed that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ram of Aaro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that the High Priest sacrifices as a burnt-offering on Yom Kippur, as the verse states: “With this Aaron shall come into the sacred place, with a young bull for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 16:3). This offering is certainly the High Priest’s alone and is therefore classified as the offering of an individual. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">So, too</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is reasonable </span>that this is the offering referred to in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">for if it should enter your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mind </span>to say that we are dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with the bull </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the High Priest, consider the following: Is <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat and ritual impurity </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">substitution of the bull </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not override, </span>which indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrifice </span>this substitute <span class="gemarra-regular">on a weekday? It is a substitute for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering, and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the substitute </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for a sin-offering is left to die</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rather, we certainly must be dealing with the ram for a burnt-offering, as the substitute for a burnt-offering cannot be sacrificed. 
The Gemara rejects this supporting argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">No,</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">actually </span>possible that the offering referred to in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is the Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">bull of </span>the High Priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is the substitution </span>that was mentioned? It does not refer to a substitution of the bull, but rather the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> deals with the general <span class="gemarra-regular">category </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">substitution</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., it means that the phenomenon of substitution in general includes <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> that do not apply to offerings. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>one can <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>say that the <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrifice </span>mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> means the general <span class="gemarra-regular">category </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrifices, </span>rather than a specific offering. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not teaching </span>about a general <span class="gemarra-regular">category </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrifices</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., it is definitely not dealing with the phenomenon of offerings in general. 
The Gemara continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do I know that this is so? <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is taught: </span>There is <span class="gemarra-regular">a stricture </span>that applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span>substitution beyond the strictures that apply to the initial offering, in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the sanctity of the <span class="gemarra-regular">substitution takes effect </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">on a permanently blemished </span><span class="gemarra-regular">animal, and </span>the substitute <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot vacate </span>its sanctified status and assume <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred </span>status for its wool <span class="gemarra-regular">to be sheared </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and to be worked. And should it enter your mind </span>to say: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrifice </span>mentioned here, it means the general <span class="gemarra-regular">category </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrifices; </span>this cannot be the case, as <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>an example of an offering to which these <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> also apply, 

Daf 51a

e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn or </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe, </span>the sanctity of which <span class="gemarra-regular">takes effect </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a permanently blemished animal, and </span>this offering <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot vacate </span>its sanctified status and assume <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred </span>status for its wool <span class="gemarra-regular">to be sheared and to be worked. Rather, </span>you must say that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not teaching </span>a general <span class="gemarra-regular">category </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of sacrifices, </span>but when it states: Offering, it is referring to a particular one. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is different </span>about the two statements, i.e., why does the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> deal with a specific case in one area, but a general category in the other? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Substitution is one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> category, </span>as there is no difference between one case of substitution and another. By contrast, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrifices, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is a firstborn and there is </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe, </span>whose <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> differ from other offerings, and therefore one cannot establish a single general principle. Consequently, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> certainly is referring to a specific offering. 
The Gemara continues the previous discussion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet, </span>who explains that the offering in question is not the bull of the High Priest but his ram, <span class="gemarra-regular">rather than establishing </span>and interpreting this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the ram of Aaron, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">let him establish </span>that it deals <span class="gemarra-regular">with the Paschal offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which overrides Shabbat and ritual impurit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>one can <span class="gemarra-regular">perform substitution </span>for it, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>according to all opinions, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is the offering of an individual. </span>The Gemara answers: Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not slaughter the Paschal lamb</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on behalf of an individual</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but only for a group. This means that it is not an offering of an individual but, at the very least, that of partners. For this reason, one cannot perform substitution for a Paschal lamb. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">establish</span> the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the second </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Pesaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is slaughtered by an individual. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does </span>the second <span class="it-text">Pesaḥ</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">override ritual impurity? </span>Since this offering does not override ritual impurity, it cannot be the offering referred to in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rava: And </span>according to the <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the aforementioned <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, concerning the dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Ya’akov, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">different </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Paschal offering, that he calls </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it the offering </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">an individual? And what is different </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival peace-offering, </span>which is eaten with the Paschal offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">that he calls it a communal</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> offering? If </span>this distinction is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the Festival peace-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">is brought by a multitude</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the entire nation brings it, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Paschal offering is also brought by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a multitude, </span>not as an individual offering. Rava replied: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is the second </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Pesaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which is not brought</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by a multitude, </span>and therefore the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> does not call the Paschal offering <span class="gemarra-regular">a communal offering.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: If so, </span>that the second <span class="it-text">Pesaḥ</span> is a communal offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">it should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> override Shabbat and ritual impurity. He said to him: Yes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as the opinion of this <span class="it-text">tanna</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the one who said </span>that the second <span class="it-text">Pesaḥ</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">overrides </span>ritual impurity. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">second </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Pesaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> overrides Shabbat, but it does not override ritual </span><span class="gemarra-regular">impurity. Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">even overrides ritual impurity. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason of the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that one brings a second <span class="it-text">Pesaḥ</span> solely <span class="gemarra-regular">because ritual impurity overrode his</span> obligation to sacrifice the first <span class="it-text">Pesaḥ</span>, i.e., he did not sacrifice the first <span class="it-text">Pesaḥ</span> because he was impure at that time. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">perform </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Pesaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that, with regard to the second <span class="it-text">Pesaḥ</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “According</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to all the statute of the Paschal offering they shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> keep it” </span>(Numbers 9:12), which indicates that it should <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>be brought <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity, </span>unlike the first <span class="it-text">Pesaḥ</span>. As for the claim of the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, that the whole reason for the second <span class="it-text">Pesaḥ</span> is due to ritual impurity, Rabbi Yehuda could respond: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah sought </span>an opportunity <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>one who was impure at the time of the first <span class="it-text">Pesaḥ</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to perform it in</span> a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual purity; </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not merit</span> to perform it in purity, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">perform it</span> even <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity. </span>

Daf 51b

§ Returning to Rabbi Elazar’s question as to whether a High Priest can perform substitution for his bull, the Gemara seeks to prove that the other priests were not full partners in this offering but only gained atonement incidentally. <span class="gemarra-regular">And let me derive </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> from the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states: </span>“And Aaron shall sacrifice the bull of the sin-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for himself” </span>(Leviticus 16:11), indicating that the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">brings</span> the bull <span class="gemarra-regular">from his own </span>property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Which is for himself” </span>means that <span class="gemarra-regular">he brings </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his own </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">and not from </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">community</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> I <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that the High Priest may <span class="gemarra-regular">not bring </span>this offering <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">community </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">the community </span>as a whole <span class="gemarra-regular">does not gain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">atonement through it, but </span>he may <span class="gemarra-regular">bring </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of his fellow priests, as his fellow priests do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gain atonement through it. </span>Therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “Which is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for himself,” </span>i.e., it must belong to him and no one else.
I <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that the High Priest should <span class="gemarra-regular">not bring </span>the bull from the property of the other priests ab initio, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did bring </span>it from their property, the offering is <span class="gemarra-regular">valid. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span>continues and <span class="gemarra-regular">states again: </span>“And he shall slaughter the bull for the sin-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is for himself” </span>(Leviticus 16:11); <span class="gemarra-regular">the text repeats </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>phrase: “Which is for himself,” to emphasize that this requirement <span class="gemarra-regular">is indispensable </span>and that if the High Priest brings a bull that belongs to someone else, the offering is invalid. 
The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to your reasoning, if his fellow priests do not acquire </span>a share <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the bull, <span class="gemarra-regular">how does it atone for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them? </span>Since they achieve atonement through the offering, they must own a share in it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>you must say that <span class="gemarra-regular">the property [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">gazza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Aaron </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Merciful One rendered it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ownerles</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to his fellow priests. </span>Although the High Priest brings a bull from his own funds, it is as though he sanctifies it on behalf of all of the priests. But if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">here too, with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to substitution, </span>we could likewise say that <span class="gemarra-regular">the property of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron is different </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Merciful One rendered it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless with regard to his fellow priests. </span>Consequently, there is no proof from here that a High Priest can perform substitution for his bull.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">would </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">walk </span>west <span class="gemarra-regular">through </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Sanctuary until he reaches </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">between the two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> curtains that separated the Sanctuary</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Holy of Holies, and </span>the space <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>was one <span class="gemarra-regular">cubit. Rabbi Yosei says: There was only one curtain there, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And the curtain shall divide for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies” </span>(Exodus 26:33).
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> saying well to the Rabbis, </span>i.e., Rabbi Yosei provides solid support for his opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you: This applies </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Tabernacle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which had but one curtain. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, in the Second Temple</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, since there was no one-cubit partition </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">teraksin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> separating the Holy of Holies from the Sanctuary of the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it </span>was only <span class="gemarra-regular">in the First Temple that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there was </span>a one-cubit partition, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain with regard to the sanctity </span>of the space occupied by the one-cubit partition, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it had the sanctity <span class="gemarra-regular">of the inside </span>of the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>the sanctity <span class="gemarra-regular">of the outsid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> area of the Sanctuary, therefore the Sages of the time <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared two curtains </span>to enclose this space of uncertain status. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught: </span>When the High Priest walked to the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">he walked </span>on the south side <span class="gemarra-regular">between the </span>inner <span class="gemarra-regular">altar and the candelabrum. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says </span>that he walked on the north side <span class="gemarra-regular">between the table and the altar. And some say</span> he passed <span class="gemarra-regular">between the table and the wall. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is introduced by the title: <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rav Ḥisda said: It is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei</span> in our mishna, according to whom there is only one curtain and <span class="gemarra-regular">who said </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">entrance was positioned in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the north. </span>According to all opinions, the entrance to the Holy of Holies was located in the north, and since Rabbi Yosei believed that there was just one curtain, the High Priest would walk in a straight line toward this entrance along the north side of the Sanctuary.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda </span>maintains that there were two curtains, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that although the entrance to the Holy of Holies was on the north side, because there were two curtains, one behind the other, the <span class="gemarra-regular">entrance was positioned in the south. </span>The High Priest entered on the south side and walked between the curtains to the north of the inner curtain where he entered the Holy of Holies. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Meir, in accordance with whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">does he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hold? If he holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>with regard to the place of the entrance, the High Priest should <span class="gemarra-regular">enter as </span>explained by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda; </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, he </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">enter as </span>explained by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: The tables, </span>the one holding the shewbread and other tables next to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> arranged north to south, and the table blocked him </span>on the north side, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">could not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enter </span>in a direct line, as the space was too narrow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually the </span>tables <span class="gemarra-regular">were arranged east to west</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> due to </span>the honor of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Divine Presence, it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not proper conduct </span>

Daf 52a

<span class="gemarra-regular">to enter directly, </span>as it is more appropriate for the High Priest to approach the Holy of Holies somewhat circuitously. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in response to this <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: The Jewish people </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are beloved </span>by God, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the Torah did not require </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>to make use <span class="gemarra-regular">of an agent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> e.g., an angel, to intercede on their behalf. Instead, God hears the nation’s prayers directly. Consequently, the High Priest, who represents the people on Yom Kippur, need not approach in a roundabout fashion. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if an indirect approach is a mark of respect, in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, too, let </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span>indirectly <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">candelabrum and the wall. </span>The Gemara answers: If the High Priest walks by that route, he might <span class="gemarra-regular">blacken his clothes </span>through the soot left on the wall by the candelabrum. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan said: </span>With regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">one-cubit partition, the Sages did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not determine </span>its status, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it was part <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>of the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>part <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>area of the Sanctuary. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina strongly </span><span class="gemarra-regular">objects to this </span>opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this uncertainty? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “And the House that King Solomon built for the Lord</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was sixty cubits in length, and its width was twenty</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits, and its height was thirty cubits” </span>(I Kings 6:2), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written: “And the House, that is, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Sanctuary, was forty cubits long” </span>(I Kings 6:17), <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written: “And before the partition twenty cubits in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> length, and twenty cubits in width, and twenty cubits in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> height” </span>(I Kings 6:20), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">know whether the one-cubit partition </span>was part <span class="gemarra-regular">of these </span><span class="gemarra-regular">twenty </span>cubits of the Holy of Holies or part <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these forty </span>cubits of the Sanctuary, then this problem can be resolved.
Ravina explains the resolution of the problem: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>part <span class="gemarra-regular">of these twenty </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>part <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these forty </span>cubits, as in establishing the measurements the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">counts the space </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">does not count </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">walls </span>themselves, i.e., the cubit of the wall is not included in either measurement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Know </span>that it is so, <span class="gemarra-regular">as anywhere </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">counts </span>the area of <span class="gemarra-regular">the walls </span>in addition to the spaces they contain, it also <span class="gemarra-regular">counts </span>the one-cubit partition. 
Ravina cites a proof for the previous claim. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sanctuary </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">by one hundred </span>cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">with a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">height of one hundred </span>cubits. From east to west, the hundred cubits were divided as follows: The <span class="gemarra-regular">wall of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Entrance Hall </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>cubits; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Entrance Hall </span>itself was <span class="gemarra-regular">eleven </span>cubits; the <span class="gemarra-regular">wall of the Sanctuary </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">six</span> cubits; the <span class="gemarra-regular">length </span>of the Sanctuary itself was <span class="gemarra-regular">forty </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cubits; and </span>there was the <span class="gemarra-regular">one-cubit partition; </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Hall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Holy of Holies </span>was another <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty cubits; </span>the outer <span class="gemarra-regular">wall of the Sanctuary </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>cubits; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> chamber </span>behind it was <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>cubits; <span class="gemarra-regular">and the wall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the chamber </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">five </span>cubits. This mishna proves that when the walls are counted in addition to the spaces, the one-cubit partition is included in the calculation. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the uncertainty does not concern the location of the one-cubit partition, which was certainly positioned between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies. Instead, the issue is <span class="gemarra-regular">its sanctity, whether </span>it was considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like the insid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">or like the outside </span>area of the Sanctuary. Since there was no such wall in the Second Temple, the Sages were uncertain with regard to the status of the extra cubit. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is what Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosef of Hutzal raised a dilemma </span>with regard to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he prepared a partition in the midst of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the House within to set there the Ark of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Covenant of the Lord” </span>(I Kings 6:19). This was his <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">was raised before </span>the Sages: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">speaking? </span>
The Gemara explains the dilemma. Should it be read: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Solomon <span class="gemarra-regular">prepared a partition in the midst of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">House within to set there, </span>meaning that he placed the partition within the Temple and behind it he prepared a space to place the Ark, and the partition itself did not possess the sanctity of the Holy of Holies? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps this is </span>what the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: A partition in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the midst of the House within, </span>i.e., the verse ends there, while the rest of the text forms a new verse. According to this interpretation, the place of the partition itself was part of the Holy of Holies, and that was where Solomon prepared a place for the Ark. 
The Gemara is surprised at this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And was </span>Yosef of Hutzal really <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain </span>how to punctuate this verse? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Isi ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda says: </span>There are <span class="gemarra-regular">five verses in the Torah whose </span>meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot be decided</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., it is unclear from the text how the verses should be read. 

Daf 52b

The first example is the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Se’et</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Genesis 4:7). It is unclear whether the verse should be read: “If you do well, shall it not be lifted up [<span class="it-text">se’et</span>]?” in which case <span class="it-text">se’et</span> involves forgiveness and pardon; or: “If you do well, but you will lift up [<span class="it-text">se’et</span>] your sin if you do not do well.” According to this interpretation, <span class="it-text">se’et</span> is referring to remembrance: If you do not do well, your sin will be remembered. 
The second uncertain case is the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Meshukkadim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Exodus 25:34). This verse can be read: “And in the candelabrum four cups made like almond blossoms [<span class="it-text">meshukkadim</span>]”; or as: “Its knops and its flowers made like almond blossoms [<span class="it-text">meshukkadim</span>].” In other words, the term <span class="it-text">meshukkadim</span> can be read either with the first part or the last part of the verse.
Likewise, the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Maḥar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Exodus 17:9) can be read: “And go out, fight with Amalek tomorrow [<span class="it-text">maḥar</span>]”. Alternatively, it can mean that Joshua must go out to war with Amalek immediately, and Moses added: “Tomorrow [<span class="it-text">maḥar</span>] I will stand on the top of the hill” (Exodus 17:9), but today you do not need my prayer. Once again, the issue is whether this term belongs to the beginning or the end of the verse. 
The fourth case is the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Arur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Genesis 49:7). This verse can be read: “Cursed [<span class="it-text">arur</span>] be their anger for it was fierce, and their wrath for it was cruel,” on account of Levi and Simeon’s treatment of Shechem. Alternatively, this term, which appears at the beginning of the verse, can be read as the last word of the previous verse: “And in their anger they cut off cursed [<span class="it-text">arur</span>] oxen” (Genesis 49:6–7). According to this interpretation, “cursed oxen” is referring to the oxen of Shechem, who descended from the accursed Canaan.
Finally, the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Vekam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Deuteronomy 31:16) can be read as: “Behold, you are about to sleep with your fathers and rise up [<span class="it-text">vekam</span>]” at the time of the resurrection of the dead; or: “And this people will rise up [<span class="it-text">vekam</span>] and go astray.” 
The Gemara explains the objection presented by this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Yosef of Hutzal is the </span>one called <span class="gemarra-regular">Yosef the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Babylonian</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as Hutzal is a city in Babylonia; and <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>also the person called <span class="gemarra-regular">Isi ben Yehuda, </span>as Isi is a shortened form of Yosef; <span class="gemarra-regular">he is Isi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Gur Arye, </span>a nickname for Yehuda; <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Isi ben Gamliel; he is Isi ben Mahalalel? And what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is his </span>real <span class="gemarra-regular">name? Isi ben Akiva is his name</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If they are indeed the same person, Isi ben Yehuda, who is Yosef of Hutzal, says that there are only five verses whose punctuation is unclear, whereas here he adds an additional verse. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">In the Torah </span>itself, there are indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>more than five verses, but <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Prophets there are </span>more examples of equivocal punctuation, one of which is the verse from I Kings.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">And in the Torah </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">are there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>other examples of indeterminate punctuation? <span class="gemarra-regular">But there is </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma that Rav Ḥisda raised </span>with regard to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he sent the young men of the children </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Israel who sacrificed burnt-offerings” </span>(Exodus 24:5); were these burnt-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">sheep, </span>and when the verse continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And sacrificed peace-offerings of bulls to the Lord,” </span>these peace-offerings alone were bulls? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps these and these</span> were <span class="gemarra-regular">bulls, </span>as the word “bulls” is referring both to the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings? This is another verse whose punctuation is unclear. The Gemara rejects this contention: This is not difficult; <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rav Ḥisda </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> uncertain </span>how to read the verse, but the interpretation was <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious to Isi ben Yehuda. </span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The outer </span>curtain between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">was hooked [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">perufa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> slightly open <span class="gemarra-regular">on the south</span> side of the Sanctuary, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inner </span>curtain <span class="gemarra-regular">hooked </span>slightly open <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nort</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> side of the Sanctuary, and therefore the High Priest could not enter the Holy of Holies directly. Rather, he enters through the southern opening and <span class="gemarra-regular">walks between </span>the curtains <span class="gemarra-regular">until he reaches the </span>opening to the <span class="gemarra-regular">north. </span>When <span class="gemarra-regular">he reaches the </span>opening to the <span class="gemarra-regular">north, </span>he enters the Holy of Holies through that opening, <span class="gemarra-regular">turns his face to the south, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">walks to his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">left along the curtain until he reaches </span>the area before <span class="gemarra-regular">the Ark. </span>
When <span class="gemarra-regular">he reaches the Ark</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he places the coal pan between the two staves. He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> piles the incense atop </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">coals, and the whole chamber</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in its entirety would fill with smoke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">exits and comes </span>out <span class="gemarra-regular">the way </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he entered. </span>He does not turn around but leaves the Holy of Holies walking while facing the Ark. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he recites a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brief prayer in the outer chamber, </span>in the Sanctuary. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he would not extend his prayer </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">so as not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to alarm the Jewish people, </span>who would otherwise conclude that something happened and that he died in the Holy of Holies.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dealing </span>here? To which time period is the mishna referring? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">about the First Temple, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were there curtains </span>then? There was only one curtain over the one-cubit partition. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>if we say that the mishna is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with the Second Temple, was there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an Ark </span>there? 
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Ark was buried</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> along with it was buried the jar of manna </span>that was next to it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the flask of oil </span><span class="gemarra-regular">used for anointing, and Aaron’s staff with its almonds </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and blossoms</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the chest that the Philistines sent </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">doron</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the God of Israel </span>after they captured the Ark and were stricken by several plagues, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And put the jewels of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gold that you return to Him for a guilt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, in a coffer by its side, and send it away</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that it may go” </span>(I Samuel 6:8)?
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">And who buried </span>the Ark? <span class="gemarra-regular">Josiah, </span>king of Judea, <span class="gemarra-regular">buried </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it. And what did he see that </span>he decided to <span class="gemarra-regular">bury it? He saw that it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lord will bring you, and your king whom you shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">set over you, </span>to a nation that you have not known” (Deuteronomy 28:36). Since he knew that the Jewish people would ultimately be exiled, he felt it was better that the Ark should not be disgraced in exile, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">he arose and buried it. </span>
The Gemara cites the source for the tradition that Josiah buried the Ark. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is stated: “And he said to the Levites who taught </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all of Israel, who were sacred to the Lord: Put </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the sacred Ark in the house that Solomon, son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">David, king of Israel, built. There shall no more be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a burden upon your shoulders; now serve the Lord your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">God, and His people Israel” </span>(I Chronicles 35:3). In other words, from now onward the Levites will no longer carry the Ark on their shoulders, and they should dedicate themselves to their service of singing and locking the gates of the Temple. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar said: </span>The matter <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived </span>by means of a verbal analogy, as it is written with regard to the Ark: “That is by the Ark of the Testimony, before the Ark cover that is above the testimony, <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>will I meet with you” (Exodus 30:6), and it is written: “Take a jar and put a full <span class="it-text">omer</span> of manna <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>and place it before the Lord for safekeeping throughout your generations” (Exodus 16:33). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">derived </span>by verbal analogy from the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“Generations” </span>written here and <span class="gemarra-regular">“generations” </span>written with regard to the oil used for anointing: “This shall be a sacred anointing oil for Me throughout your generations” (Exodus 30:31).
Rabbi Elazar continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">derived </span>by verbal analogy from the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“safekeeping” </span>stated here and <span class="gemarra-regular">“safekeeping” </span>stated in connection to the staff of Aaron: “Place back the rod of Aaron before the testimony for safekeeping” (Numbers 17:25). These verbal analogies teach that all of these items were hidden together with the Ark. Evidently, there was no Ark in the Holy of Holies even before the First Temple period ended. How, then, can the mishna speak of the Ark during the Second Temple period? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Second Temple, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and what is </span>the meaning of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">Reaches the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ark? </span>It means the <span class="gemarra-regular">place of the Ark. </span>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But it is taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he places</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the coal pan between the two staves, </span>which indicates that the staves of the Ark were present. The Gemara answers: Emend the text and <span class="gemarra-regular">say: As </span>though it was <span class="gemarra-regular">between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the two staves, </span>i.e., in the place where the staves had been located when the Ark was there. 
§ The mishna taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">He piles the incense atop </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">coals. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he piles </span>the incense on the coals and does not scatter it there. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">He piles </span>the incense in the section of the coal pan <span class="gemarra-regular">closest </span>to the Ark, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is farthest from </span>the High Priest, until he reaches the other side of the coal pan. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it was taught in another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">He piles it </span>in the section of the coal pan <span class="gemarra-regular">farthest </span>from the Ark, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is closest to him. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>issue <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And Abaye said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: It is reasonable </span>to explain <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who said </span>that he piles the incense in the section of the coal pan <span class="gemarra-regular">closest </span>to the Ark, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is farthest from him. As we learned </span>in a mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the priest who burns the incense: <span class="gemarra-regular">Be careful </span>

Daf 53a

<span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to begin </span>piling the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">in front of you, </span>i.e., from the side closest to you, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be burned. </span>If the priest were to place the incense on the side directly in front of him and then proceed to spread it toward the Ark, his hands would pass over the incense that is already burning and he might burn himself.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">put the incense upon the fire before the Lord” </span>(Leviticus 16:13); this means that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">not prepare </span>by placing the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">outside, </span>in the Sanctuary, <span class="gemarra-regular">and bring </span>into the Holy of Holies a coal pan holding the burning incense. This was emphasized in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude the opinion of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Sadducees</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">prepare </span>the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>and then <span class="gemarra-regular">bring </span>it in.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What did </span>the Sadducees <span class="gemarra-regular">interpret; </span>what verse do they cite as the basis for their opinion? The Gemara answers that it was the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For I will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">appear in a cloud upon the Ark cover” </span>(Leviticus 16:2), which the Sadducees say <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that he should prepare </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">outside, </span>so there would already be a cloud of incense, and only then should <span class="gemarra-regular">he bring </span>it inside the Holy of Holies. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them: Wasn’t it already stated </span>explicitly: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> put the incense upon the fire before the Lord” </span>(Leviticus 16:13), which indicates that the High Priest should present the incense only when he stands before God in the Holy of Holies? <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, what </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “For I will appear in a cloud upon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Ark cover” </span>(Leviticus 16:2)? This verse does not mean that there should already be an incense cloud before he enters. 
Instead, this verse is referring to the shape of the incense cloud, and it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that he includes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a smoke-raiser in its </span>spices, a plant that causes the smoke to rise straight up like a staff. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that he includes a smoke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-raiser in its </span>spices? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: “And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the incense cloud shall cover the Ark cover” </span>(Leviticus 16:13). Therefore, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not include a smoke-raiser, or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if he omitted any one of its spices</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is liable </span>to receive the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>penalty.
The Gemara analyzes this last <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: Why does one incur the death penalty for omitting one of the spices? <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>the fact that he incurs the death penalty for a different action, <span class="gemarra-regular">as his entry </span>into the Holy of Holies is <span class="gemarra-regular">for no purpose</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> It is prohibited to enter the Holy of Holies unless one is performing a mitzva. If the incense lacks an ingredient, the High Priest is not truly performing the mitzva, and therefore he has entered the Holy of Holies for no purpose. Consequently, he incurs the death penalty on account of his entry, even without burning the incense.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he </span>acted <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">entry, </span>i.e., he was unaware that entering for no reason renders him liable, or he did not mean to enter the Holy of Holies at all; <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>acted <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally with </span>regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">burning, </span>knowing that one who burns incense that lacks an ingredient incurs the death penalty. In that case, he is liable to receive the death penalty only for burning incomplete incense. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said </span>a different explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>acted <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally with </span>regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">both this and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he knew full well that he would be liable to receive the death penalty both for burning incomplete incense and for entering the Holy of Holies for no purpose, it is nevertheless possible that he is not liable to receive the death penalty for his entry. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rav Ashi explains that this is the halakha in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he brought two </span>sets of <span class="gemarra-regular">incense </span>into the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">one complete </span>with all the spices <span class="gemarra-regular">and one incomplete, </span>both of which he burned. <span class="gemarra-regular">For </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">entry </span>to the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not liable </span>to be put to death, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he brought in </span>a coal pan with <span class="gemarra-regular">complete </span>incense and thereby fulfilled the mitzva. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">for burning he is liable </span>to receive the death penalty, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he burns incomplete incense. </span>
§ The Gemara analyzes the above <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">includes a smoke-raiser in its </span>spices? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “And it shall cover” </span>(Leviticus 16:13). The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: One <span class="gemarra-regular">verse for </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">verse? </span>The requirement of a smoke-raiser was already proven from the verse: “For I will appear in a cloud upon the Ark cover” (Leviticus 16:2); why cite a second verse in support of the first one? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: This is </span>what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">said; </span>this is how to understand the matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing other </span>than the obligation to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a leaf of a smoke-raising </span>plant. <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived that he must also bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a root of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a smoke-raiser? The verse states: “And it shall cover,”</span> which indicates the requirement for more of the smoke-raiser than might have been supposed from the other verse. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>to Rav Yosef: Your interpretation indicates that the leaf of the smoke-raiser raises smoke better than its root, as the requirement for a root is merely considered an addition. <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t the opposite taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">He put</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into </span>the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">a root of a smoke-raiser, </span>and the smoke <span class="gemarra-regular">would rise in a column like a staff</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until it reached </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">ceiling. When it reached </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ceiling </span>there was nowhere for the smoke to exit the building, and therefore it slowly <span class="gemarra-regular">descended the walls until </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>entire <span class="gemarra-regular">House was filled with smoke, as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated: “And the House was filled with smoke” </span>(Isaiah 6:4). This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> indicates that the root of the smoke-raiser raises smoke better than its leaf.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Abaye said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">said; </span>this is how it should be understood: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing other </span>than the obligation to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a root of a smoke-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">raising </span>plant. <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived that he must also bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a leaf of a smoke-raiser? The verse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">states: “And it shall cover.” </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> means the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>than the inclusion of a smoke-raiser amongst the other spices in <span class="gemarra-regular">the Tent of Meeting that </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the wilderness; from where </span>is it derived that this obligation extends to the Tabernacle at <span class="gemarra-regular">Shiloh and </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the eternal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Temple </span>in Jerusalem? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “And it shall cover</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>which indicates that wherever the High Priest enters the Holy of Holies to burn incense, he must include a smoke-raiser in its ingredients. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived from </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And so shall he do for the Tent </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Meeting that dwells with them” </span>(Leviticus 16:16). This verse teaches that this rite must be performed not only that first time in the wilderness, but wherever the Divine Presence dwells.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, this is </span>what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing other </span>than the obligation to include a smoke-raiser in the spices of the incense offered <span class="gemarra-regular">on Yom Kippur </span>in the Holy of Holies; <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where </span>is it derived that this obligation applies to the incense offered <span class="gemarra-regular">on the rest of the days of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> year </span>in the Sanctuary? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “And it shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cover,” </span>to teach that every incense burned in the Temple must include a smoke-raiser. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: One </span>verse teaches us <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mitzva </span>itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>verse teaches that this requirement is <span class="gemarra-regular">indispensable, </span>i.e., the rite is invalid if one omits this ingredient. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: One </span>verse teaches that the omission of the smoke-raiser renders one liable to receive the <span class="gemarra-regular">punishment </span>of death, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>verse serves <span class="gemarra-regular">as a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> warning </span>that it is prohibited to omit it, as the Torah does not require punishment without issuing a warning. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>“Speak to Aaron your brother that he should not come at all times into the sacred place within the curtain, before the Ark cover that is upon the Ark; <span class="gemarra-regular">that he not die” </span>(Leviticus 16:2). This verse teaches the <span class="gemarra-regular">punishment </span>for the omission of the smoke-raiser from the spices of the incense. With regard to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For I will appear in a cloud </span>upon the Ark cover” (Leviticus 16:2); this is the <span class="gemarra-regular">warning </span>that it is prohibited to omit the smoke-raiser, which causes the cloud to rise. 
One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>verses <span class="gemarra-regular">were said before the deaths of Aaron</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s sons, </span>who died upon entering the sacred place. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “After the deaths of the two sons</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Aaron” </span>(Leviticus 16:1). One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">both of them, </span>the punishment and the warning, <span class="gemarra-regular">were said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> after the deaths of Aaron’s two sons. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verse states: “For I will appear in a cloud upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Ark cover</span>.” <span class="gemarra-regular">How so; </span>how should these verses be understood? The <span class="gemarra-regular">warning </span>was said <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>of Aaron’s sons, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the punishment </span>associated with it was stated <span class="gemarra-regular">after the death </span>of his sons.
The Gemara expresses puzzlement at Rabbi Eliezer’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span>biblical <span class="gemarra-regular">derivation? </span>How does Rabbi Eliezer learn from the phrase “I will appear” that the warning was stated earlier? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “For</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I will appear in a cloud”; </span>the future tense indicates that the cloud over the Ark cover <span class="gemarra-regular">had not yet</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> appeared, </span>as the Tabernacle had not been built, which means that this command was issued before Aaron’s sons entered and died. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what is the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reason </span>that Aaron’s sons <span class="gemarra-regular">were punished </span>with death, if the punishment had not been stated? The Torah does not punish one who is unaware of the sin’s punishment. 
The Gemara answers: They were not punished for their entry into the sacred place but for a different reason, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: Aaron’s sons </span><span class="gemarra-regular">died only because they taught a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Moses their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teacher; </span>they should have asked him for his ruling, but they neglected to do so. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they interpret </span>from the verse that led them to enter the sacred place with fire? The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the altar” </span>(Leviticus 1:7), which indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">although fire descends</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the heavens, </span>it is a <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva to bring man</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-made </span>fire. To fulfill this mitzva, Aaron’s sons entered and brought fire to the altar. Although their ruling was in accordance with the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, they incurred the death penalty for failing to ask Moses. 
§ The mishna teaches that the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">exits and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> comes </span>out <span class="gemarra-regular">the way </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he entered, </span>i.e., he does not turn around, but walks backward with his face toward the Ark. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> matters </span>derived; what is the source in the Torah for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And Solomon came to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> high place that was at Gibeon, Jerusalem” </span>(II Chronicles 1:13). <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, what does Gibeon have to do with Jerusalem?</span> Either he came to Gibeon or to Jerusalem; these are two different places. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">compares his exit from Gibeon to Jerusalem to his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> arrival from Jerusalem to Gibeon. Just as </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">his arrival from Jerusalem to Gibeon his face was</span> necessarily <span class="gemarra-regular">turned toward the high place, in the usual manner</span> of a person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">arrival, so too, </span>upon <span class="gemarra-regular">his exit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from Gibeon to Jerusalem his face </span>was still <span class="gemarra-regular">turned toward</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the high place, in the manner of his arrival. </span>This teaches that one does not turn his face away from a sacred place; rather, he must walk backward.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">likewise, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">priests in their service; and Levites </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on their platform </span>in the Temple, where they recited songs; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Israelites at their watches, </span>where they observed the sacrifice of the daily offering: <span class="gemarra-regular">When they departed </span>from the sacred place, <span class="gemarra-regular">they would not turn their faces and walk but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would turn their faces sideways and walk, </span>so as not to turn their backs on the sacred place. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise, a student who takes leave of his teache</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> should <span class="gemarra-regular">not turn his face and walk but turn </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his face sideways and walk</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with that </span>practice <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Elazar when he took leave </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of his teacher, Rabbi Yoḥanan. When Rabbi Yoḥanan wanted to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">leave </span>him, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar would bend down and stand in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his place </span>as a sign of respect and humility, <span class="gemarra-regular">until</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yoḥanan disappeared from his sight; </span>only then would Rabbi Elazar turn to leave. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And when Rabbi Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wanted to leave, he would walk backward until he disappeared</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from Rabbi Yoḥanan’s sight, </span>and only then would he walk normally, so as not to turn his back on his teacher. The Gemara further relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rava took leave</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav Yosef, he would walk backward, </span>paying no attention to the obstacles in his path, <span class="gemarra-regular">until his legs </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were bruised and the threshold of Rav Yosef’s house </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was bloodied </span>from Rava’s wounds. 

Daf 53b

<span class="gemarra-regular">They said to Rav Yosef: This</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is what Rava does. </span>Rav Yosef was blind and could not see for himself. Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">May it be </span>God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">will that you lift your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">head over the entire city</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in reward for honoring your teacher. 
§ Apropos the obligation of a student to walk backward when taking leave of his teacher, the Gemara discusses a similar topic. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Alexandri said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prays must take three step</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> backwar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> upon concluding his prayer <span class="gemarra-regular">and then recite: Peace, </span>in a manner befitting one who departs from before the Holy One, Blessed be He. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mordekhai said to him: Since he has taken</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> three steps backward, he should stand there </span>and not return to his place immediately. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">analogous to a student</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who takes leave of his teacher. If he returns immediately</span> to the place where was first standing, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is similar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a dog who returns to its vomit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and his previous action is spoiled. 
The Gemara comments that <span class="gemarra-regular">this was also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who prays must take three steps backward </span>upon concluding his prayer <span class="gemarra-regular">and then recite: Peace. And if he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not do so, it is better for him not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to have prayed, </span>as his actions are disrespectful toward God. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they said in the name of Shemaya </span>the Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">one recites: Peace, </span>he first bows <span class="gemarra-regular">to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> right and then to the left, as it is stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “At His right hand was a fiery law to them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Deuteronomy 33:2), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it says: “A thousand may fall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">at your side, and ten thousand at your right side” </span>(Psalms 91:7). 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the reason for: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it says?</span> Why is it necessary to cite another source? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">the usual</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> manner to give </span>an object <span class="gemarra-regular">with the right </span>hand, but this bears no special significance, <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear: “A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your right side,” </span>which indicates that the right side is the more significant one. 
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava saw Abaye reciting: Peace, </span>by bowing at the end of his prayer <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">right first. </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: Do you maintain </span>that you should bow <span class="gemarra-regular">to your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> right? I say </span>you should bow <span class="gemarra-regular">to your left </span>first, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is the right of the Holy One, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Blessed be He, </span>since He is opposite you face-to-face, as it were. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Huna, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: I observed that Abaye and Rava </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">three steps all in one </span>act of <span class="gemarra-regular">bowing, </span>without standing upright in between, by way of submission to and acceptance of God’s authority.
§ The mishna taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">recites a brief prayer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the outer chamber. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pray? Rava bar Rav Adda and Ravin bar Rav Adda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> both said in the name of Rav </span>that this was his prayer: <span class="gemarra-regular">May it be your will, Lord our God</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, that this year shall be rainy and hot. </span>The Gemara immediately expresses surprise at this request: Is <span class="gemarra-regular">heat a good</span> matter? Why should he request that the year be hot? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say </span>and emend it as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the upcoming year is <span class="gemarra-regular">hot, may it </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">be rainy, </span>lest the heat harm the crops.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rava, concluded </span>the language of this prayer <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> name of Rav Yehuda: May the rule of power not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> depart from the house of Judah; and may your nation</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Israel not depend on each other for sustenance, </span>rather, they should be sustained from the produce of their land; <span class="gemarra-regular">and let not the prayer of travelers enter Your presence </span>when they pray for the rain to stop on their travels.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanina ben Dosa was walking on the road </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">rain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fell upon him. He said: Master of the Universe, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">entire world is comfortable and Ḥanina is suffering. The rain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stopped. When he came to his house he said: Master </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the Universe, the entire world is suffering </span>for lack of rain <span class="gemarra-regular">and Ḥanina is comfortable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> The rain came </span>back. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: What effect does the prayer of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the High Priest have with regard to Rabbi Ḥanina ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Dosa? </span>Notwithstanding the prayer of the High Priest in the Holy of Holies, Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa’s sanctity is greater, as God fulfills his bidding.
§ The mishna stated that the High Priest would not extend his prayer. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught</span> in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident </span>involving <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> High Priest who extended his prayer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and his fellow</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> priests </span>took a vote, <span class="gemarra-regular">counted, </span>and decided <span class="gemarra-regular">to go in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> after him </span>out of concern that he had died or fainted and required assistance. <span class="gemarra-regular">They began to enter and </span>at that moment <span class="gemarra-regular">he emerged. They said to him: Why did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you extend your prayer? He said to them: </span>Why not? <span class="gemarra-regular">Does it trouble you that I prayed for you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and for the Temple not to be destroyed? They said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: Do not make a habit of doing so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as we learned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He would not extend his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prayer, so as not to alarm the Jewish people, </span>who might fear he had died.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">After the Ark</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was taken </span>into exile, <span class="gemarra-regular">there was a rock </span>in the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">from the days of the early </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prophets, </span>David and Samuel, who laid the groundwork for construction of the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>this stone <span class="gemarra-regular">was called </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">foundation</span> rock. It was <span class="gemarra-regular">three fingerbreadths higher than the ground, and</span> the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">would place </span>the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">on it. </span>After the High Priest left the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">took the blood </span>of the bull sacrificed as a sin-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who was stirring </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so it would not coagulate. <span class="gemarra-regular">He entered into the place that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>had previously <span class="gemarra-regular">entered</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stood at the place where he </span>had previously <span class="gemarra-regular">stood </span>to offer the incense, between the staves. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he sprinkled </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>time <span class="gemarra-regular">upward and seven </span>times <span class="gemarra-regular">downward</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And he would neither intend to sprinkle </span>the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">upward nor </span>to sprinkle it <span class="gemarra-regular">downward, but rather like one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who whips, </span>with the blood sprinkled in a single column, one drop below the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>is how <span class="gemarra-regular">he would count </span>as he sprinkled, to avoid error: <span class="gemarra-regular">One; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one and one; one and two; one and three; one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and four; one and five; one and six; one and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seven. </span>The High Priest then <span class="gemarra-regular">emerged </span>from there <span class="gemarra-regular">and placed </span>the bowl with the remaining blood <span class="gemarra-regular">on the golden pedestal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the Sanctuary.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">They brought him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the goat </span>to be sacrificed as a sin-offering to God. <span class="gemarra-regular">He slaughtered it and received its blood in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bowl. He </span>again <span class="gemarra-regular">entered into the place that he </span>had previously <span class="gemarra-regular">entered, </span>the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">and stood at the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> place that he </span>previously <span class="gemarra-regular">stood, and sprinkled from </span>the blood of the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>time <span class="gemarra-regular">upward and seven </span>times <span class="gemarra-regular">downward</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And this </span>is how <span class="gemarra-regular">he would count, </span>just as he counted when sprinkling the blood of the bull: <span class="gemarra-regular">One; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one and one; one and two; etc. </span>The High Priest then <span class="gemarra-regular">emerged </span>from the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">and placed </span>the bowl with the remaining blood <span class="gemarra-regular">on the second golden pedestal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the Sanctuary. Rabbi Yehuda says: There was only one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pedestal there, </span>and he <span class="gemarra-regular">took the blood of the bull</span> from the pedestal <span class="gemarra-regular">and placed the blood of the goat</span> in its place. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And he sprinkled from </span>the blood of the bull <span class="gemarra-regular">on the curtain opposite the Ark from outside</span> the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>time <span class="gemarra-regular">upward and seven </span>times <span class="gemarra-regular">downward, and he would not intend, etc. And this </span>is how <span class="gemarra-regular">he would count, etc. </span>When he concluded, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">took the blood of the goat </span>from the pedestal <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">placed blood of the bull </span>in its place on the pedestal. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he sprinkled from </span>the goat’s blood <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the curtain opposite the Ark from outside, </span>just as he did with the blood of the bull, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>time <span class="gemarra-regular">upward </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and seven </span>times <span class="gemarra-regular">downward, etc. </span>Afterward, <span class="gemarra-regular">he poured the blood </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the bull into the blood of the goat and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">placed </span>the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">from the full </span>bowl into the <span class="gemarra-regular">empty </span>bowl, so that the blood would be mixed well.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments with regard to the wording of the mishna: It does <span class="gemarra-regular">not teach: After </span>the Ark <span class="gemarra-regular">was buried, but: After</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">was taken. </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>this mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Ark was exiled to Babylonia </span>and was not buried in its place, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: The Ark was exiled to Babylonia, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And at the turn of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">year King Nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to Babylonia, along </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with the precious vessels of the House of the Lord”</span> (II Chronicles 36:10). These precious vessels must include the Ark. 
Likewise, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: The Ark was exiled to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Babylonia, as it is stated: </span>“Behold, the days come that all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored until this day, shall be carried to Babylonia; <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">davar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] shall be left, says the Lord”</span> (Isaiah 39:6). <span class="gemarra-regular">These are the Ten Commandments [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dibrot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] that are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inside it; </span>they too shall not be left behind. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Lakish says: The Ark was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">buried in its place, as it is stated: “And the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ends of the staves were seen from the sacred place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before the partition, but they could not be seen without; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and they are there to this day” </span>(I Kings 8:8). The expression “to this day” means forever, as the text might be read at any time. This teaches that the Ark is hidden in its place. 
The Gemara comments: And <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> opinion that the Ark was exiled to Babylonia <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees with</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">of Ulla, as Ulla said: Rabbi Matya ben Ḥarash</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> asked Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai in Rome: And since Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eliezer taught us once and twice, </span>i.e., from two separate verses, that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Ark was exiled to Babylonia. </span>The Gemara interrupts its citation of Rabbi Matya ben Ḥarash’s question to identify these two verses. <span class="gemarra-regular">The first </span>verse is <span class="gemarra-regular">that which we said: “And brought him to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Babylonia, along with the precious vessels of the House of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Lord.” What is the second </span>verse? Rabbi Eliezer said: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “And gone from the daughter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Zion is</span>

Daf 54a

<span class="gemarra-regular">all her splendor” </span>(Lamentations 1:6). <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">“All her splendor [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hadara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]”? </span>It means: <span class="gemarra-regular">Her chamber [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥadra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., something that was hidden within the innermost chambers, namely the Ark. <span class="gemarra-regular">You, </span>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, <span class="gemarra-regular">what do you say </span>in response to this? <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: As I say, the Ark was buried </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in its place </span>and not exiled, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And the staves were so long </span>that the ends of the staves were seen from the sacred place before the partition, but they could not be seen without; and they are there to this day” (I Kings 8:8). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to Ulla: From where </span>in this verse may it <span class="gemarra-regular">be inferred </span>that the Ark was buried in its place? Ulla replied that the source is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “And they are there to this day,” </span>which is referring to any day when one might read this sentence, i.e., forever. Rabba objected to this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is it the case that <span class="gemarra-regular">anywhere that it is written “to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this day” it </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">forever, </span>as opposed to the time when the verse was written? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwelt with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> children of Benjamin in Jerusalem, to this day” </span>(Judges 1:21)? <span class="gemarra-regular">So too here, </span>let us say <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the Jebusites <span class="gemarra-regular">were not exiled </span>from Jerusalem. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: No</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person passed through </span>the land of <span class="gemarra-regular">Judea </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">fifty-two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> years </span>after the destruction of the Temple by Nebuchadnezzar, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is stated: “I will raise crying and wailing for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the mountains, and a lamentation for the pastures of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wilderness, for they have been burned, with no person passing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> through. And they do not hear the sound of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cattle; from the bird of the heavens to the beast</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">behema</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], all have fled and gone” </span>(Jeremiah 9:9). <span class="gemarra-italic">Behema</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>spelled <span class="it-text">beit</span>, <span class="it-text">heh</span>, <span class="it-text">mem</span>, <span class="it-text">heh</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">has a numerical value</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of fifty-two, </span>alluding to the fact that no one passed through the land for fifty-two years. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it was taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span>For <span class="gemarra-regular">seven years </span>a curse of <span class="gemarra-regular">brimston</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and salt endured in Eretz Yisrael, </span>rendering it unfit for human habitation. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">What is the rationale of Rabbi Yosei; </span>from where does he learn this? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">derived from </span>a verbal analogy between <span class="gemarra-regular">“covenant” </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">“covenant.” It is written here: “And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he shall make a firm covenant with many for one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">week” </span>(Daniel 9:27), i.e., seven years. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written there: </span>“And that its entire land is brimstone and salt…<span class="gemarra-regular">They shall say: Because they forsook the covenant </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the Lord, the God of their fathers” </span>(Deuteronomy 29:22; 24). Evidently, the Jebusites must have been exiled from Jerusalem, which proves that the phrase “to this day” does not always mean forever.
Ulla <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Here, </span>with regard to the Ark, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: </span>“And they are <span class="gemarra-regular">there”; </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">there,</span> in the verse that deals with the Jebusites, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not written. And anywhere that “there” is written </span>with the phrase “to this day” <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">forever. </span>The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from the following verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And some </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred </span><span class="gemarra-regular">men, went to Mount Seir having for their captains Pelatiah </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Neariah and Rephaiah and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And they smote the remnant of the Amalekites who escaped, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and dwelt there to this day” </span>(I Chronicles 4:42–43). 
The Gemara explains its objection: <span class="gemarra-regular">But Sennacherib</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, king of Assyria, </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">already come, and </span>through his policy of forced population transfer <span class="gemarra-regular">he had scrambled all </span>the nations of <span class="gemarra-regular">the lands, as it is stated </span>in reference to Sennacherib: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And I have removed the bounds of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">peoples, and have robbed their treasures”  </span>(Isaiah 10:13). This indicates that the children of Simeon were also exiled, despite the fact that the verse states: “There to this day.” The Gemara concludes: Indeed, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation </span>of Ulla’s statement.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said </span>that a Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say</span> that the <span class="gemarra-regular">Ark </span>of the Covenant <span class="gemarra-regular">was buried in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Chamber of the Woodshed. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: We</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, too, have learned </span>in a mishna: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> involving a certain priest who was occupied </span>with various matters, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he saw a floor </span>tile in the woodshed that was <span class="gemarra-regular">different from the others. </span>One of the marble floor tiles was higher than the rest, suggesting it had been lifted out and replaced. <span class="gemarra-regular">He came and informed his friend</span> of the uneven tile, <span class="gemarra-regular">but was unable to finish his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> report </span>and provide the exact location of the tile <span class="gemarra-regular">before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his soul departed </span>from his body. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>consequently <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">knew definitively that the Ark was buried there, </span>but its location was meant to be kept secret. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What was he doing, </span>that priest who noticed the misplaced tile? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥelbo said: He was occupied</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his axe, </span>i.e., he was banging the floor with his axe. He thereby discovered an empty space under a tile, which he guessed was the opening of a tunnel. <span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Two blemished </span><span class="gemarra-regular">priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were sorting wormy wood when the axe of one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of them dropped and fell there, </span>into the hole in the floor. Blemished priests were appointed to inspect the wood for worms, as these logs were unfit for use on the altar. <span class="gemarra-regular">And fire burst out and consumed </span>that priest, so the exact location remains unknown. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda raised a contradiction. It is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written: “The ends of the staves were seen,” and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is written </span>in that same verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But they could</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not be seen without” </span>(I Kings 8:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>can one reconcile this contradiction? <span class="gemarra-regular">They were seen and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seen, </span>i.e., the staves were partially visible. <span class="gemarra-regular">This was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The ends of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">staves were seen”; </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">they did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not move from their position </span>and did not protrude at all. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And the staves were so </span><span class="gemarra-regular">long.</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">they ripped through </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the curtain and emerged </span>on the other side; therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verse states: “They could not be seen without.” </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>is this so? The staves of the Ark <span class="gemarra-regular">pushed and protruded and stuck </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out against the curtain </span>toward the outside, <span class="gemarra-regular">and appeared like </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the two breasts of a woman </span>pushing against her clothes. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: “My beloved is to me like </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a bundle of myrrh, that lies between my breasts” </span>(Song of Songs 1:13). For this reason the Ark of the Covenant, where the Divine Presence rests, is positioned so that its staves protrude through the curtain, like the breasts of a woman.
Continuing the previous discussion, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ketina said: When the Jewish people would ascend</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>one of the pilgrimage <span class="gemarra-regular">Festivals, </span>the priests would <span class="gemarra-regular">roll up the curtain for them and show them the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cherubs, which were clinging to one another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to them: See how you are beloved before God, like </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the love of a male and female. </span>The two cherubs symbolize the Holy One, Blessed be He, and the Jewish people. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda raised an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> objection: </span>How could the priests allow the people to see this? After all, it is stated with regard to the Tabernacle: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But they shall not go in to see </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the sacred objects as they are being covered, </span>lest they die” (Numbers 4:20), <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: When the vessels were put into their containers </span>for transport, it was prohibited even for the Levites to look at them. The prohibition against viewing the vessels should be even more severe when they are fixed in their sacred place within the Temple. How could they be publicly displayed? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said </span>in answer: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">analogous to a bride; as long as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">she is </span>engaged but still <span class="gemarra-regular">in her father’s house,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> she is modest </span>in the presence <span class="gemarra-regular">of her husband</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> However, <span class="gemarra-regular">once she </span>is married and <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to her father</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-in-law’s house </span>to live with her husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">she</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is no longer modest </span>in the presence <span class="gemarra-regular">of her husband</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Likewise, in the wilderness, when the Divine Presence did not dwell in a permanent place, it was prohibited to see the sacred objects. By contrast, all were allowed to see the sacred objects in their permanent place in the Temple.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥana bar Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ketina raised an objection </span>from the aforementioned mishna: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving a certain priest who was occupied </span>and discovered the place where the Ark was hidden, and he subsequently died before he could reveal its location. Since he was prevented from seeing the Ark, it was evidently prohibited to see the sacred objects even after the Temple was built. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>This is not difficult, as <span class="gemarra-regular">you are speaking </span>of when <span class="gemarra-regular">she was divorced</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Since the Jewish people were exiled after the destruction of the First Temple, they are compared to a woman divorced from her husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">and when </span>a woman is <span class="gemarra-regular">divorced </span><span class="gemarra-regular">she returns to her original beloved </span>but reserved state. She is once again modest and does not reveal herself. Likewise, the Divine Presence will remain hidden until the glory of the First Temple is restored. 
The Gemara poses a question concerning Rav Ketina’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dealing </span>here; in what circumstance did the priests roll up the curtain to show everyone the cherubs? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>this is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">First Temple, was there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a curtain </span>between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies? In the First Temple, there was a wall there. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather,</span> we will say this is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Second Temple</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">were there cherubs </span>there? Since there was no Ark, it follows that there were no cherubs on it. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>Rav Ketina is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">First</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Temple, and what is the curtain </span>that he mentioned? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">the curtain of the gates. </span>For all of the Jewish people to be able to see, they had to raise the curtains hanging on all the gates. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Zeira said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: There were thirteen curtains</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the </span>Second <span class="gemarra-regular">Temple: Seven opposite, </span>i.e., on the inside of, <span class="gemarra-regular">seven gates; two </span>additional ones within the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of which was <span class="gemarra-regular">at the entrance to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sanctuary and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of which was <span class="gemarra-regular">at the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">entrance to the Entrance Hall. Two </span>additional curtains were <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the partition, </span>in the Holy of Holies in place of the one-cubit partition, <span class="gemarra-regular">and two corresponding to them </span>were above <span class="gemarra-regular">in the upper chamber. </span>Above the Holy of Holies, there was another level in the same layout as the one below, and a curtain was affixed there, too, as no one climbed up to the higher chamber above the Holy of Holies without a pressing need. These curtains were most likely hanging in the First Temple as well. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Ya’akov said: Actually, </span>Rav Ketina’s statement is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Second Temple: </span>There was a curtain at the entrance of the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">there were images of cherubs there, </span>i.e., drawn or engraved pictures of the cherubs on the walls. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And he carved all the walls of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the house round about with carved figures of cherubs and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">palm trees and open flowers, </span>within and without” (I Kings 6:29), and it is further stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he overlaid</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them with gold fitted upon the graven work” </span>(I Kings 6:35), which teaches that in addition to the cherubs within the sacred place, other cherubs were drawn on the walls. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written: “According to the space of each</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">loyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(I Kings 7:36). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">“According to the space of each</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">loyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”? Rabba bar Rav Sheila said: </span>

Daf 54b

It means <span class="gemarra-regular">like a man</span> joined and <span class="gemarra-regular">clinging to his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">livaya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>his partner, i.e., his wife. In other words, the cherubs appeared to be embracing one another. <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: When gentiles </span>destroyed the Second Temple and <span class="gemarra-regular">entered the Sanctuary, they saw </span>these drawings of <span class="gemarra-regular">cherubs clinging to one another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> They peeled them from the wall, <span class="gemarra-regular">took them out to the market, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and said: These Jews, whose blessing is a blessin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whose curse is a curse, </span>due to their great fear of God, should <span class="gemarra-regular">they be occupied with such matters,</span> making images of this kind? <span class="gemarra-regular">They immediately debased </span>and destroyed <span class="gemarra-regular">them, as it is stated: “All who honored her </span><span class="gemarra-regular">debase her because they have seen her nakedness” </span>(Lamentations 1:8).
§ The mishna taught that a stone sat in the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">and it was called </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">foundation [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shetiyya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>rock. A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: Why was it called <span class="it-text">shetiyya</span>? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the world was created [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hushtat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] from it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">world was created from Zion. As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: The world was created </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from its center, as it is stated: “When the dust </span><span class="gemarra-regular">runs into a mass, and the clods cleave fast together”</span> (Job 38:38). The world was created by adding matter to the center, like the formation of clumps of earth. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">world was created from the sides, as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is stated: “For He said to the snow: Become the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> earth, likewise to the shower of rain, and to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> showers of His mighty rain” </span>(Job 37:6). This verse indicates that the rains fell from all sides, which led to the creation of the earth. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The Holy One, Blessed be He, cast a stone into </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the sea, from which the world was created, as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is stated: “Upon what were its foundations fastened; or who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">laid its cornerstone?” </span>(Job 38:6). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>The world <span class="gemarra-regular">was created from Zion, as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated: “A Psalm of Asaph. God, the Lord God </span>has spoken and called the earth, from the rising of the sun to its place of setting” (Psalms 50:1), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it states: “Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, </span>God has shined forth” (Psalms 50:2). The mishna is taught in accordance with this last opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: “These are the generations </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the heaven and the earth when they were created, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on the day that the Lord God made earth and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">heaven” </span>(Genesis 2:4) means that the <span class="gemarra-regular">generations of the heavens</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., all things found in the heavens, <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">created from the heavens</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> while the <span class="gemarra-regular">generations of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">earth were created from the earth. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: Both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these and those were created from Zion, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: “A Psalm of Asaph. God, the Lord God has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spoken and called the earth, from the rising of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sun to its place of setting,” and it says: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shined </span><span class="gemarra-regular">forth,” </span>i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>Zion <span class="gemarra-regular">the beauty of the world</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was perfected, </span>which includes both the generations of the heavens and the generations of the earth.
§ The mishna taught that the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">took the blood </span>of the bull <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who was stirring it </span>so it would not coagulate, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he entered </span>and sprinkled it like one who whips. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">Like one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whips? Rav Yehuda demonstrated </span>the action with his hand, 

Daf 55a

<span class="gemarra-regular">like one who lashes with a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> on the back of another and who occasionally strikes lower down. A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkles </span>the blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not sprinkle </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the top of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Ark cover; rather, </span>he does so <span class="gemarra-regular">against the thickness of the Ark cover. When </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he sprinkles </span>once <span class="gemarra-regular">upward, he turns his hand </span>so that the back of his hand faces <span class="gemarra-regular">downward, </span>and he then sprinkles upward. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when he sprinkles </span>seven times <span class="gemarra-regular">downward, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he turns his hand </span>so its back is <span class="gemarra-regular">upward. </span>However, he does not sprinkle on the Ark cover or below it, so that the blood does not actually come into contact with it. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters, </span>that the sprinklings do not actually touch the Ark cover, derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Ya’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">akov said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: The verse states </span>with regard to the goat sacrificed as a sin-offering: “And he shall do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, <span class="gemarra-regular">and sprinkle it upon the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ark cover and before the Ark cover” </span>(Leviticus 16:15). The verse should <span class="gemarra-regular">not say downward, </span>i.e., “before the Ark cover,” with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to the goat, as </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">is unnecessary; </span>this requirement <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived from </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">downward</span> in connection <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull. </span>
Since the rite performed with the blood of the goat is compared to the rite of the blood of the bull, <span class="gemarra-regular">why</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>the requirement that the High Priest must sprinkle downward <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>twice? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">to juxtapose </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“upon </span>the Ark cover” <span class="gemarra-regular">to “before </span>the Ark cover”; <span class="gemarra-regular">just as “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">before” </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the Ark cover but merely in front of it, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, “upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the Ark cover but in front of it, and the High Priest simply turns his hand upward.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, </span>the verse should <span class="gemarra-regular">not say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upward, </span>i.e., “before the Ark cover,” with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the bull, as </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">is unnecessary; </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived from </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">upward </span>stated in connection <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">goat. </span>Since the verse equates the two rituals, <span class="gemarra-regular">why does it state</span> the upward sprinkling of the blood of the bull? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">to juxtapose </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“before </span>the Ark cover,” stated with regard to the bull, <span class="gemarra-regular">to “upon </span>the Ark cover,” stated with regard to the goat; <span class="gemarra-regular">just as “upon”</span> stated by the goat means <span class="gemarra-regular">actually upon, </span>as indicated by the literal meaning of the verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, “before”</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">actually upon </span>it, i.e., the blood of the goat should touch the thickness of the Ark cover.
The Gemara expresses surprise at this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is this </span>comparison? <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">downward </span>stated with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the goat </span>is mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">to juxtapose it to upward </span>stated with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to the bull, one needs </span>the phrase “upon the Ark cover,” which deals with the blood of the bull, <span class="gemarra-regular">for that which the school of Rabbi Eliezer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Ya’akov taught. As the school of Rabbi Eliezer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Ya’akov taught: “Upon [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">al</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">penei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the Ark cover </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the east” </span>(Leviticus 16:14); <span class="gemarra-regular">this forms an analogy </span>that applies to the entire Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any place where it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated “face [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">penei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing other </span>than the <span class="gemarra-regular">eastern </span>side. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if you say, </span>as suggested by the question, that <span class="gemarra-regular">upward </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bull </span>is mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">to juxtapose </span>it to “upward” stated with regard to the goat, <span class="gemarra-regular">for what purpose does downward </span>stated with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to the goat come; </span>what do we learn from this phrase? Rather, the first interpretation of the verse must be correct.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: “And sprinkle it upon the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ark cover and before the Ark cover” </span>(Leviticus 16:15). <span class="gemarra-regular">We</span> have thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">learned how many </span>times the High Priest must sprinkle <span class="gemarra-regular">upward for the goat, </span>that is, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>sprinkling, as it states: “And sprinkle.” However, with regard to the sprinkling <span class="gemarra-regular">downward for the goat, </span>before the Ark cover, <span class="gemarra-regular">I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do not know how many </span>times he must sprinkle.
<span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> from the verses. <span class="gemarra-regular">It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> states</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">blood </span>is sprinkled <span class="gemarra-regular">downward </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the bull, and it states </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">blood </span>is sprinkled <span class="gemarra-regular">downward </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the goat. Just as </span>the blood that he sprinkles <span class="gemarra-regular">downward </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the bull </span>consists of <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>sprinklings, as the verse explicitly states: “And before the Ark cover he shall sprinkle seven times” (Leviticus 16:14), <span class="gemarra-regular">so too,</span> the sprinkling of the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">downward </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the goat </span>is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>times. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>one can <span class="gemarra-regular">go </span>and reason <span class="gemarra-regular">this way: It states</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">blood</span> is sprinkled <span class="gemarra-regular">upward </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">goat, and </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">it states </span>that<span class="gemarra-regular"> blood</span> is sprinkled <span class="gemarra-regular">downward </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the goat. Just as </span>with regard to sprinkling <span class="gemarra-regular">upward </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the goat </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>sprinkling, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>with regard to sprinkling <span class="gemarra-regular">downward </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the goat </span>there is only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>sprinkling. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us see what </span>case this <span class="gemarra-regular">resembles: One derives </span>an act performed <span class="gemarra-regular">downward </span>from another act that is <span class="gemarra-regular">downward, and one does not derive </span>an act performed <span class="gemarra-regular">downward from an upward </span>act. 
The Gemara retorts: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one derives </span>one aspect of <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter from </span>another aspect of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">matter, </span>i.e., one should infer the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the blood of the goat from another <span class="it-text">halakha</span> involving that same blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">that matter from </span>an external <span class="gemarra-regular">matter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And he shall do with its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blood as he did with the blood of the bull</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Leviticus 16:15). <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>need for <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse to state: “As he did,” </span>because the whole process is explicitly stated a second time, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>then is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “As he did”? </span>It comes to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">that all his actions should be alike</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>down to every detail. Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>the sprinklings <span class="gemarra-regular">downward </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the bull </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">seven, so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> too, </span>the sprinklings <span class="gemarra-regular">downward </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">goat </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">seven.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">We have </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">learned how many </span>sprinklings are performed <span class="gemarra-regular">downward </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the bull and by the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> goat: Seven. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">I do not know how many </span>times the High Priest must sprinkle <span class="gemarra-regular">upward </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the bull.

Just as </span>with regard to the sprinkling <span class="gemarra-regular">upward </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the goat </span>he sprinkles <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>time, as stated explicitly, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bull </span>he sprinkles <span class="gemarra-regular">upward one </span>time. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>one can <span class="gemarra-regular">go </span>and reason <span class="gemarra-regular">this way: It is stated</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">blood</span> is sprinkled <span class="gemarra-regular">downward </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the bull, and</span> likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">blood</span> is sprinkled <span class="gemarra-regular">upward </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the bull.

The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us see what </span>case this <span class="gemarra-regular">resembles: One derives</span> an act performed <span class="gemarra-regular">upward </span>from another act that is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">upward, and one does not derive </span>an act performed <span class="gemarra-regular">upward from a downward </span>act.
The Gemara retorts: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contrary, one derives </span>one aspect of <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter from </span>another aspect of <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">matter, and one does not derive</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">that matter from </span>an external <span class="gemarra-regular">matter. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And he shall do with its blood</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as he did.” As </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>need for <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse to state: “As he did,” </span>because the whole process is explicitly stated a second time, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>then is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “As he did</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”? </span>It comes to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">that all his actions should be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> alike: Just as </span>the sprinklings <span class="gemarra-regular">downward </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the bull </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">seven, so too, </span>the sprinklings <span class="gemarra-regular">downward </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the goat </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">seven; and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>the sprinkling <span class="gemarra-regular">upward </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">goat </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">one, so too, </span>the sprinkling <span class="gemarra-regular">upward </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the bull </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">one.</span>
§ The mishna states that the High Priest counted: <span class="gemarra-regular">One; one and one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; one and two. The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that when sprinkling, the High Priest counted: <span class="gemarra-regular">One; one and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one; one and two; one and three; one and four; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one and five; one and six; one and seven. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says </span>that he counted: <span class="gemarra-regular">One; one and one; two and one; three</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one; four and one; five and one; six and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one; seven and one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">They do not disagree </span>about the matter itself that the High Priest sprinkles once upward and seven times downward. Rather, this <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage </span>rules <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the norm <span class="gemarra-regular">in his place, and </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage </span>rules <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with</span> the norm <span class="gemarra-regular">in his place. </span>In one place they counted the smaller number first, while in the other place they would count the larger number first. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any </span><span class="gemarra-regular">case, everyone, </span>both Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, agrees that <span class="gemarra-regular">the first sprinkling </span>upward <span class="gemarra-regular">must be counte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> together <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">each and every one </span>of the subsequent sprinklings. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>for this? Why can’t the High Priest count the downward sprinklings separately? The Sages debated this matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: </span>The reason is so <span class="gemarra-regular">that he does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not err in the sprinklings. </span>If the High Priest were to count downward without including the first upward sprinkling, he might mistakenly think that his calculation includes the first sprinkling, which would lead him to add another one. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said </span>that the reason is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> states: </span>“And he shall sprinkle it with his finger upon the Ark cover, <span class="gemarra-regular">and before the Ark cover he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall sprinkle” </span>(Leviticus 16:14). <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>need for <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse to state: He shall sprinkle” </span>again, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “He shall sprinkle”? </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to the first sprinkling that it must</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be counted with each and every </span>subsequent <span class="gemarra-regular">one, </span>i.e., he must mention the first sprinkling every time. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>these two explanations? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>concerns a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not count </span>the first sprinkling <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not err. </span>That is acceptable according to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, whereas according to Rabbi Yoḥanan the High Priest acted incorrectly, as it is mitzva to count the first one.
§ The mishna taught that the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">emerged </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and placed </span>the bowl with the remaining blood of the bull <span class="gemarra-regular">on the golden pedestal in the Sanctuary, </span>and later he placed the goat’s blood on a second pedestal, whereas according to Rabbi Yehuda there was only one pedestal. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>(<span class="it-text">Shekalim</span> 6:6) that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: There were no </span>collection <span class="gemarra-regular">horns </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for obligatory nests, </span>i.e., the pairs of pigeons or turtledoves brought as sin- and burnt-offerings by women after childbirth or other individuals, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the </span>concern of <span class="gemarra-regular">mixtures</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the meaning of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">Due to a mixture? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the possible <span class="gemarra-regular">mixture </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of obligatory </span>nests <span class="gemarra-regular">with free-will </span>ones. There was concern lest the priests mix the money given for obligatory nests, which are sacrificed as a sin-offering and a burnt-offering, with the money for free-will nests, which are sacrificed as a pair of burnt-offerings. Mixing the funds in this way would disqualify the birds. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: And let us prepare two </span>collection horns <span class="gemarra-regular">and write </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on them which is </span>the container <span class="gemarra-regular">for obligatory </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which is </span>the one for <span class="gemarra-regular">free-will </span>offerings. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span>

Daf 55b

<span class="gemarra-regular">does not accept </span>that one may rely on <span class="gemarra-regular">writing </span>in a situation where an error is possible. <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we learned </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">There was only one pedestal </span>in the Temple on which to place the blood. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that they did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>place <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>pedestals there? The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the pedestals might be <span class="gemarra-regular">exchanged </span>for one another, and he might take the goat’s blood instead of that of the bull. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">let us place two </span>pedestals <span class="gemarra-regular">and write on them which </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">is for the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bull and which is for the goat. Rather, </span>it is clear that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda does not accept </span>that one may rely on <span class="gemarra-regular">writing </span>in a situation where error is possible.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>against this conclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">There were thirteen </span>collection <span class="gemarra-regular">horn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the Temple</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and they were </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">inscribed </span>with different names. On one container was written: <span class="gemarra-regular">New shekels. </span>In this horn they placed shekels that were donated at the correct time that year. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>on another horn the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">old shekels </span>was written, referring to coins from the past year that did not reach the Temple during the allotted period. On the other horns, the following phrases were written: <span class="gemarra-regular">Nests, </span>for obligatory offerings consisting of pairs of pigeons or turtledoves; <span class="gemarra-regular">young birds for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offerings; wood, </span>for anyone who wished to donate wood; <span class="gemarra-regular">frankincense; and gold for the Ark cover</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>there were <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>additional boxes designated <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>communal <span class="gemarra-regular">free-will offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of all kinds. 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">New shekels, these are </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">shekels</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of each and every year </span>that arrive on time; <span class="gemarra-regular">old</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shekels, </span>these are for <span class="gemarra-regular">one who did not donate a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shekel the previous year, </span>who must <span class="gemarra-regular">donate the next year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; nests, these are the turtledoves </span>brought as offerings; <span class="gemarra-regular">young birds</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for burnt-offerings, these are pigeons; and all these </span>birds <span class="gemarra-regular">are burnt-offerings; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Rabbi Yehuda maintains that there was no container for nests of obligatory sin-offerings and burnt-offerings, due to the potential mixture between the two. In any case, this shows that Rabbi Yehuda does rely on inscriptions written on containers, which contradicts the above claim that he does not rely on writing in these situations. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: They say in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, that this is a rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span><span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the possible presence in the mixture of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offering whose owners have died. </span>Since a sin-offering of this kind must be left to die, if one of the donors of the coins in the sin-offering horn passes away, his funds cannot be used. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And are we concerned </span>about the possible death of a donor? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sends his sin-offerin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from overseas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they sacrifice it </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> presumption that he is alive, </span>although he might have died in the meantime. This shows that the possibility of death is not taken into account. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rabbi Yehuda’s concern is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering whose owner has certainly died, </span>lest it be confirmed that one of the people who donated money for a sin-offering bird has indeed died. The Gemara asks: Even so, this can be rectified, as <span class="gemarra-regular">let us </span><span class="gemarra-regular">select four </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zuz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the price of such an offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> throw them into the water </span>to be destroyed. It may be said that the money removed from the box was the money for the sin-offering whose owner died, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these </span>other coins <span class="gemarra-regular">will be permitted. </span>It will be clarified retroactively that these coins were designated for that purpose. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda does not accept </span>the rule of retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">clarification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In his opinion, one cannot issue a designation after the fact. Consequently, he rejects this solution.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do we </span>derive that this is indeed Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from that which we learned </span>in the following mishna, there is a difficulty. The mishna states: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who buys wine from among the Samaritans</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who do not tithe their produce properly, <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat eve at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nightfall </span>and has no time to separate the tithe before Shabbat and to place the separated portions in distinct locations, he may <span class="gemarra-regular">arise and say: Two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span> of the one hundred <span class="it-text">log</span> present here, <span class="gemarra-regular">which I will separate in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> future, </span>after Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> <span class="it-text">gedola</span> given to a priest, as the Sages mandated that one-fiftieth of one’s produce constitutes an average measure of <span class="it-text">teruma</span>; 

Daf 56a

<span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span><span class="it-text">log</span> that I will later separate shall be the <span class="gemarra-regular">first tithe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> and another tenth from the rest, which equals <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span><span class="it-text">log</span> of the remaining ninety, shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">second tithe. And he redeems </span>the second tithe with money that he will later take to Jerusalem, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>may then <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately drin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> the wine. After Shabbat, when he removes portions from the mixture and places them in vessels, they are retroactively designated as <span class="it-text">terumot</span> and tithes. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. </span>

Daf 56b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, and Rabbi Shimon prohibit </span>this practice. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>Rabbi Yehuda maintains that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">clarification. </span>
The Gemara explains the difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where </span>do you reach this conclusion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps it is different</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there, as the reason is taught: </span>The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Meir: Do you not concede </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the jug </span><span class="gemarra-regular">might split ope</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> before he removes the portions of <span class="it-text">terumot</span> and tithes from the mixture, causing all the wine to spill out? <span class="gemarra-regular">And he </span>will then <span class="gemarra-regular">be found drinking untithed</span> wine <span class="gemarra-regular">retroactively. </span>Therefore, he cannot rely on separation that has not yet occurred. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he said to them: </span>Although there will be a problem <span class="gemarra-regular">if it splits open, </span>there is no cause to be concerned for this contingency in advance. Since this reasoning is based on the possibility that the jug might break, there is no proof from here that Rabbi Yehuda rejects the principle of retroactive clarification.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather,</span> the proof that Rabbi Yehuda does not accept the principle of retroactive clarification is <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> the Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">Ayo</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught. As Ayo taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: A person</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cannot stipulate conditions about two matters at once, </span>e. g., one cannot establish a joining of Shabbat boundaries [<span class="it-text">eiruv</span>] in each of two different directions on Friday afternoon while making the following stipulation: If tomorrow, on Shabbat, two Sages arrive from two different directions, I will decide then which of the two lecturers I prefer to hear at that point in time, which will determine which <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is in effect. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>he may say that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Sage comes to the east, his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the east, </span>and if the Sage comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to the west, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is to the west</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> However, </span>he may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>say that if one Sage comes <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, and </span>another Sage comes <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>he will go wherever he wishes, in either direction. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we discussed </span>this passage in the Gemara and asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about a case in which one stipulated that if Sages came <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here and from there </span>that he may go to whichever side he chooses, such that his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>effective? Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda maintains <span class="gemarra-regular">that there is no </span>retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">clarification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., this person cannot claim after the fact that the place where he walked is designated as the place that he initially intended for his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>. 
However, according to this principle, when an individual establishes an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the east and </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">the west </span>for the anticipated arrival of a single Sage, one should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>invoke the principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">clarification. </span>Why does Rabbi Yehuda agree that if one anticipates the arrival of a single Sage and stipulates that if he comes to the east his <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> will be to the east, the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is valid? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>This is not a true case of retroactive clarification, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the Sage had already </span><span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>by twilight, but the one who established the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> did not yet know at which side of the town the Sage had arrived. Therefore, at the time the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> establishes his Shabbat residence, it is clear which <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> he wants, although he himself will become aware of that only later. In this case, Rabbi Yehuda agrees that the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> is valid, but he nonetheless maintains in general that there is no retroactive clarification. This accounts for Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion that there was no container for nests of obligatory sin-offerings and burnt-offerings, as he maintains that there is no solution for the possible mixture of the different coins. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And now that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we have said </span>and proven that <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">clarification, </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">he is of </span>the opinion that one may rely on <span class="gemarra-regular">writing, </span>as proven from the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the collection horns. If so, on <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Kippur as well, let us place two </span>pedestals <span class="gemarra-regular">and write </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on them </span>which one is for the blood of the bull and which is for the blood of the goat. 
The Gemara answers: The reason they did not place two pedestals with writing on them is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the High Priest’s weakness. </span>Since he is fasting during the entire day’s service, the writing will <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">on his mind; </span>he will pay no attention to it and might become confused. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you do not say so, </span>that there is concern for the High Priest’s weakness, even <span class="gemarra-regular">without writing </span>he should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>not err, as <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>bowl in which he collects the bull’s blood <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>relatively <span class="gemarra-regular">large and this </span>one for the goat’s blood <span class="gemarra-regular">is small. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not collect all</span> the bull’s blood but only some of it, so that the bowls are of equal size, <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda say: One who slaughters </span>the bull <span class="gemarra-regular">must receive all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the blood of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull, as it is stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “And all the blood of the bull he shall pour</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out on the base of the altar” </span>(Leviticus 4:7).
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps some </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the bull’s blood <span class="gemarra-regular">might spill, </span>yielding equal amounts of blood, there should still be no mistake, as <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>blood, that of the goat, is <span class="gemarra-regular">white </span>and bright compared to the blood of the bull, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span>blood of the bull <span class="gemarra-regular">is red </span>and darker than the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather,</span> the reason must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the High Priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s weakness, </span>these differences will <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">on his mind</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Here, too, </span>the writing will not help, as <span class="gemarra-regular">due to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the High Priest’s weakness </span>the inscriptions will <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">on his mind.</span>
§ The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">A certain person descended </span>to lead the prayer service on Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> on Yom Kippur. He included the order of the High Priest’s Yom Kippur service in his prayer, and <span class="gemarra-regular">he recited: </span>The High Priest then <span class="gemarra-regular">emerged </span>from the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">and placed </span>the bowl <span class="gemarra-regular">on the second golden pedestal in the Sanctuary; he took</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the blood of the bull </span>from the pedestal <span class="gemarra-regular">and placed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the blood of the goat </span>in its place. 
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>This is problematic, as <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>statement is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. </span>According to the Rabbis, each of these bowls sat on its own pedestal in the Sanctuary, whereas Rabbi Yehuda maintains that the High Priest must first lift up the container with the blood of the bull and then put down that of the goat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>you should <span class="gemarra-regular">recite </span>the entire order of the service entirely in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis: <span class="gemarra-regular">He placed the blood of the goat </span>on its designated pedestal <span class="gemarra-regular">and took the blood of the bul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> from the second stand.
§ The mishna taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkled from </span>the blood of the bull <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">curtain opposite the Ark from outside </span>the Holy of Holies. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>“And he shall make atonement for the sacred place because of the impurities of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins; <span class="gemarra-regular">and so shall he do for the Tent of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Meeting </span>that dwells with them in the midst of their impurity” (Leviticus 16:16). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">states </span>this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as he sprinkles in the innermost sanctum</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">so he sprinkles in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sanctuary, </span>the Tent of Meeting, toward the curtain. 
Furthermore: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the innermost sanctum </span>he sprinkles <span class="gemarra-regular">once upward and seven </span>times <span class="gemarra-regular">downward from the blood of the bull, so he sprinkles</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the Sanctuary. And just as </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the innermost sanctum</span> he sprinkles <span class="gemarra-regular">once upward and seven </span>times <span class="gemarra-regular">downward from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blood of the goat, so he sprinkles in the Sanctuary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The last part of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“That dwells </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with them in the midst of their impurity,” </span>teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">even when </span>the Jewish people <span class="gemarra-regular">are impure, the Divine Presence </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is with them. </span>
With regard to this verse, the Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">A certain Sadducee said to Rabbi Ḥanina: </span>

Daf 57a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Now you are certainly</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> impure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is written </span>about the Jewish people: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Her impurity was in her skirts” </span>(Lamentations 1:9), and the Divine Presence does not dwell upon the Jews when they are impure. Rabbi Ḥanina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">see what is written about </span>the Jewish people: <span class="gemarra-regular">“That </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dwells with them in the midst of their impurity” </span>(Leviticus 16:16). This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">even when they are impure, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Divine Presence dwells among them.</span>
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the aforementioned <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. It was stated above that the comparison to the goat teaches that the High Priest sprinkles the bull’s blood once upward; and the seven downward sprinklings of the goat’s blood are derived from the rite of the blood of the bull. Subsequently, the order of sprinkling toward the curtain in the Sanctuary is again derived by means of a similar comparison. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a matter derived by juxtaposition, </span>i.e., a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> not written explicitly in the Torah but learned by means of a comparison, <span class="gemarra-regular">again teach by juxtaposition? </span>There is a general principle that a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> derived by juxtaposition with regard to offerings cannot subsequently teach another <span class="it-text">halakha</span> by juxtaposition.
The Gemara answers that the first juxtaposition was not a proper inference by verbal analogy, as <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the High Priest must sprinkle once upward and seven times downward <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>derived both <span class="gemarra-regular">from that </span>juxtaposition <span class="gemarra-regular">and something else </span>as well. Since the basic requirement that he must sprinkle upward and downward for the bull and the goat is stated explicitly in both cases, and the comparison was necessary only to teach the precise number of sprinklings, this inference <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a juxtaposition </span>to the extent that one cannot derive further comparisons from it. 
The Gemara continues to question this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">It works out well according to the one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that a juxtaposition that is also inferred from something else <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a juxtaposition </span>in this regard; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one who says </span>that this too <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>called <span class="gemarra-regular">a juxtaposition, what can be said?</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">locations </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that are derived from one another. </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the blood of the bull was not derived from that of the goat, nor the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of sprinkling the bull’s blood outside the curtain from that of sprinkling the bull’s blood inside. Instead, the first comparison equates the sprinkling of the bull’s blood and the goat’s blood, while the second comparison equates the locations, i.e., he sprinkles outside the curtain in the same manner that he sprinkles inside. Consequently, the two juxtapositions are not connected to each other, which means that there is no problem of a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> derived by juxtaposition itself teaching by juxtaposition. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>instead a different resolution: The sprinkling <span class="gemarra-regular">outside is derived from </span>the sprinkling <span class="gemarra-regular">inside all at once</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the juxtaposition includes not only the blood of the bull and the goat, but also the manners of sprinkling the blood inside and outside. There are not two comparisons here, one derived from the other, but a single, complex juxtaposition.
§ A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: When </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkles </span>the blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkle </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on the curtain but opposite the curtain. Rabbi Elazar, son </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yosei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: I saw </span>the curtain <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rome. </span>After a miracle was performed on his behalf and he healed the daughter of the Roman emperor, Rabbi Elazar was permitted to view the ruler’s treasures and take whatever he wanted. He saw the Temple vessels that the Romans captured, including the curtain. Rabbi Elazar continued: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the curtain <span class="gemarra-regular">were several drops of blood from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bull and the goat of Yom Kippur. </span>This shows that the blood was actually sprinkled on the curtain. 
The Gemara questions this conclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>how can Rabbi Elazar be sure that these drops of blood were from the bull and goat of Yom Kippur? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps</span> they <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>from the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull for an unwitting communal sin</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">the goats for </span>a sin of <span class="gemarra-regular">idolatry, </span>both of whose blood is also sprinkled on the curtain. 
The Gemara explains <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he saw that these </span>sprinklings of blood <span class="gemarra-regular">were performed in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their order, </span>one drop after another, a sequence that is followed only in the Yom Kippur service. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">also learned </span>in a mishna about <span class="gemarra-regular">a case like this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull for an unwitting communal sin: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">When he sprinkles, </span>the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">would not touch the curtain, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but if it did touch, it touched, </span>and this did not invalidate the service. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: I saw </span>the curtain <span class="gemarra-regular">in Rome, and there were several drops of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">blood on it from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull for an unwitting communal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sin and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">goats for </span>a sin of <span class="gemarra-regular">idolatry. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>how could he identify the source of the blood; <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps they </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">from the bull and goat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Yom Kippur? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He saw that they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were performed not in their orde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> and inferred that they must be sprinklings from communal sin-offerings, which are not presented in a sequence.
The Gemara asks a question: What should the High Priest do if <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood </span>of the bull <span class="gemarra-regular">became mixed with the blood </span>of the goat before he finished all the sprinklings? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>He should <span class="gemarra-regular">present </span>from the mixture <span class="gemarra-regular">once upward and seven </span>times <span class="gemarra-regular">downward,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and that counts toward </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>one, as he has sprinkled from both of them. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">They said this </span>answer <span class="gemarra-regular">before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yirmeya </span>in Eretz Yisrael, whereupon <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: Foolish Babylonians</span><span class="gemarra-regular">!</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Because they live in a dark, </span>low <span class="gemarra-regular">land, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they speak darkened </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakhot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>devoid of logic. If this solution is followed, when the High Priest sprinkles the mixture of bull and goat blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">presents </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">upward </span>sprinklings <span class="gemarra-regular">of the goat before </span>he sprinkles the <span class="gemarra-regular">downward </span>presentations of the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull; and the Torah said: “And when he has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> finished atonin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the sacred place” </span>(Leviticus 16:20), which teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">He finishes the blood of the bull </span>by sprinkling upward and downward, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward he finishes the blood</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the goat. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabbi Yirmeya said </span>that the High Priest proceeds as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">He presents once upward and seven</span> times <span class="gemarra-regular">downward for the purpose of </span>sprinkling the blood of <span class="gemarra-regular">the bull</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the blood of the bull is in this mixture. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he again presents once upward and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seven </span>times <span class="gemarra-regular">downward for the purpose of </span>sprinkling the blood of <span class="gemarra-regular">the goat. </span>Although the blood is mixed together and by sprinkling for the purpose of the bull’s blood he also sprinkles some of the goat’s blood, since he has only the bull’s blood in mind it is as though he did not sprinkle the blood of the goat at all. 
The Gemara asks another question: What should the High Priest do if <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood </span>of the bull <span class="gemarra-regular">became</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mixed with the blood </span>of the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">during the final</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> presentations </span>that he performs in the Sanctuary? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa, </span>who was sitting <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rava, though</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to say: He presents </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>times <span class="gemarra-regular">downward for the purpose of the bull and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for the purpose of the goat, and he again presents</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> once upward for the purpose of the goat. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him: Until now they called us </span>Babylonians merely <span class="gemarra-regular">foolish, and now </span>they will call us the <span class="gemarra-regular">foolish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the foolish, as </span>they will say that <span class="gemarra-regular">we teach</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not learn. </span>In response to your statement one could simply repeat Rabbi Yirmeya’s previous argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">But he presents downward </span>sprinklings <span class="gemarra-regular">for the goat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">upward </span>sprinklings <span class="gemarra-regular">for the goat, and the Torah </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Present upward and then downward. </span>

Daf 57b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: He presents downward seven </span>times <span class="gemarra-regular">for the purpose of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bull, and he again presents upward once and downward seven</span> times <span class="gemarra-regular">for the purpose of the goat. </span>
The Gemara asks another question: What if the <span class="gemarra-regular">cups became mixed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., if the bowl containing the blood of the bull was confused with that of the blood of the goat? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">He presents </span>blood from one cup by sprinkling upward once and downward seven times, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he again presents </span>a second set of sprinklings from the second cup. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And he again presents </span>another set of sprinklings, again from the first cup, which amounts to a total of <span class="gemarra-regular">three times. </span>In this manner, he fulfills the obligation no matter which cup was which. If the first cup was that of the bull’s blood and the second was that of the goat, he fulfilled his obligation with the first and second sprinklings. If the first cup contained the blood of the goat, he performed the sprinkling of the goat’s blood before that of the bull, which means his first set of sprinklings are discounted. Consequently, when he sprinkled from the second cup, which contains the bull’s blood, and a third time from the cup of the goat’s blood, he fulfilled his obligation with the second and third sets of sprinklings.
The Gemara asks yet another question: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">part of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">blood became mixe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> together <span class="gemarra-regular">and part of the blood did not become mixed, </span>e.g., if some of the blood spilled and became mixed in a third vessel, the solution is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious: When he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> presents, he presents from the </span>blood of <span class="gemarra-regular">certain </span>identity. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>one could still ask a question with regard to this case: What is the status of the mixed blood in <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> other </span>vessel or vessels? <span class="gemarra-regular">Are they </span>considered the <span class="gemarra-regular">remainder </span>of the blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the remainder of the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">goes to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the base </span>of the altar like the remainder of all blood of sin-offerings? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>this mixture of blood <span class="gemarra-regular">is rejected</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the blood from this vessel was not used for the first sprinklings, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore the two types of blood are spilled and <span class="gemarra-regular">go to the canal</span> beneath the altar, which rinses all the dirt from the courtyard into the Kidron River.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Even according to the one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one cup renders its counterpart a remainder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., if a one collected blood in two cups, the blood in the second cup is considered the remainder of the first cup, <span class="gemarra-regular">this applies </span>only in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he could present </span>blood from the second cup <span class="gemarra-regular">if he wanted </span>to, i.e., if both cups were filled with blood from the offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the blood in this vessel could <span class="gemarra-regular">not be presented </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if he wanted </span>to, it does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>become a remainder, and it is therefore certainly rejected. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Pappa: On the contrary, even according to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one who says </span>that when blood is collected in two cups <span class="gemarra-regular">one cup renders </span>the blood of <span class="gemarra-regular">its counterpart rejected, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that applies </span>only when <span class="gemarra-regular">he rejects </span>the second cup <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>his own <span class="gemarra-regular">hands, </span>i.e., by means of a direct act. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he does not reject</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it with </span>his own <span class="gemarra-regular">hands, </span>as no act of rejection was performed but rather the blood became a remainder by itself, the blood is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>rejected.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">above, it says: </span>“And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it upon the corners of the altar of the burnt-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall pour its blood </span>out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering” (Leviticus 4:25). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">below it says: </span>“And the priest shall take of its blood with his finger, and put it upon the corners of the altar of burnt-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he shall pour</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all its blood </span>out at the base of the altar” (Leviticus 4:30). The second verse adds the word “all.” 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where</span> is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a sin-offering that</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">one collected its blood in four cups and presented</span> blood from each of them by sprinkling <span class="gemarra-regular">once from this</span> cup <span class="gemarra-regular">and once from that </span>cup until he has sprinkled four times, once from each cup, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the leftover blood in <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the cups <span class="gemarra-regular">is poured </span>out as remainders <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the base </span>of the altar? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “And he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall pour all its blood.” </span>
One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he presented four presentations </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from one of them, </span>all the rest should be spilled on the base of the altar as remainder; therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verse states: “And he shall pour its blood.” </span>This indicates that not all the blood, but only <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>blood in the bowl from which blood was sprinkled on the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">is poured on the base </span>as a remainder, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the</span> rest of the cups of blood <span class="gemarra-regular">are poured into the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> canal. Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: From </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a sin-offering </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that if one collected its blood in four cup</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> presented four presentations from one of them, that they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all poured at the base </span>of the altar? <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “And he shall pour all its blood.” </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi Shimon, </span>isn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">written: “And he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall pour its blood”? </span>How does he explain this difference between the verses? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>When the Torah states “its blood,” it comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">remainders that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are in the throat of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">animal. </span>If more blood comes out of the throat after the collection of the blood, that blood is certainly not poured on the base of the altar but is swept into the canal of the Temple.
§ The mishna states that after the High Priest sprinkled the blood toward the curtain <span class="gemarra-regular">he poured the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blood of the bull into the blood of the goat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>this mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who said </span>that the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">mixes </span>the two types of blood before placing them <span class="gemarra-regular">on the corner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of the inner altar, and he does not present each one separately. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated: </span>The later <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoshiy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yonatan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> debated this issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">mixes </span>the blood for the purpose of placing the blood on the altar’s corners, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">said: He does not mix </span>the blood.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoshiya was </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">who said </span>that the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">mixes </span>the blood. In general, he maintains that whenever a verse mentions two matters, <span class="gemarra-regular">although </span>the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Together, is not written </span>explicitly, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is considered as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> though </span>the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Together, is </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">written. </span>In other words, two items that appear in the same verse are treated as combined unless expressly stated otherwise. By contrast, Rabbi Yonatan maintains that even if two matters are mentioned together they are treated separately unless the verse uses the term: Together. In this case, the verse states: “And he shall take of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat” (Leviticus 16:18). Therefore, Rabbi Yoshiya rules that the High Priest must place the two sets of blood together. 
The Gemara rejects this contention. <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan, </span>it remains possible to explain its ruling, since <span class="gemarra-regular">it is different here, as it is written “once” </span>(Exodus 30:10), which indicates that there must be one act of sprinkling and not two. Consequently, the High Priest must mix the blood to ensure that there is only one presentation. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">contrary to our response, </span>but in accordance with the initial assumption: “And he shall go out to the altar that is before the Lord, and make atonement for it; <span class="gemarra-regular">and he shall take of the blood of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bull and of the blood of the goat, </span>and put it on the corners of the altar round about” (Leviticus 16:18). This verse teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the blood of the bull and the goat should <span class="gemarra-regular">be mixed. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">statement of Rabbi Yoshiya. </span>

Daf 58a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>He presents <span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>one, the bull’s blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself, and </span>he presents <span class="gemarra-regular">from that </span>one, the goat’s blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself </span>and does not mix them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoshiya said to him: But wasn’t it already stated:</span> “And Aaron shall make atonement upon its corners <span class="gemarra-regular">once </span>a year; with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement” (Exodus 30:10), which indicates that the High Priest does not present twice? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan said to him: But wasn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it already stated: “Of the blood of the bull and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the blood of the goat” </span>(Leviticus 16:18), which teaches that each set of sprinklings must be performed by itself? <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, why is “once” stated? </span>This verse comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to tell you </span>that he must perform the rite <span class="gemarra-regular">once </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and not </span>perform <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>sets of sprinklings <span class="gemarra-regular">from the blood </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the bull; </span>and likewise he must perform the rite <span class="gemarra-regular">once and not </span>perform <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>sets of sprinklings <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">blood of the goat. </span>From the blood of each of the animals, the High Priest presents only one set of sprinklings. This shows that Rabbi Yoshiya and Rabbi Yonatan indeed disagree with regard to this issue.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall take of the blood</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the bull and of the blood of the goat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Leviticus 16:18). This verse teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the blood of the bull and the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">should be mixed together. </span>Do <span class="gemarra-regular">you say that they should be mixed together, or perhaps </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is not </span>the case; rather, he presents <span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>blood <span class="gemarra-regular">by itself and from that by itself? </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “Once.” </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">unattributed </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoshiya, </span>who said the two sets of blood are mixed, as stated in the mishna.
§ It was taught in the mishna that after the High Priest poured the bull’s blood into the goat’s blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">he placed </span>the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">from the full </span>bowl <span class="gemarra-regular">into the empty </span>bowl, to mix the blood well. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama raised a dilemma before Rav Ḥisda: What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">he placed </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">bowl inside </span>a second <span class="gemarra-regular">bow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and collected the blood in </span>the inner bowl? Does one <span class="gemarra-regular">type </span>of object mingled <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>another of <span class="gemarra-regular">its</span> own <span class="gemarra-regular">type interpose, </span>which would mean that the priest has not collected the blood himself, as the outer bowl interposed between him and the vessel? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>perhaps an object of one type <span class="gemarra-regular">does not interpose </span>for another object of the same type, and therefore the two bowls are considered one object. 
Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: We </span>have already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>the answer to this question in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">He placed </span>the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">from the full </span>bowl <span class="gemarra-regular">into the empty </span>bowl. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is it not </span>correct to infer from this statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">he inserted </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full bowl into </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">empty bowl?</span>
Rami bar Ḥama responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it means that <span class="gemarra-regular">he poured </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full bowl into </span>an <span class="gemarra-regular">empty bowl. </span>Rav Ḥisda said to him: But this statement is unnecessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna already <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the requirement to pour from one vessel into another in the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>clause: <span class="gemarra-regular">He poured the blood of the bull into the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">blood of the goat. </span>The subsequent phrase: He placed the full into the empty, must therefore refer to the placement of one vessel inside another. Rami bar Ḥama responded: No, it means that he pours the blood from the full bowl into the empty bowl a second time <span class="gemarra-regular">in order </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to mix them very well. </span>To this end, he pours from one vessel into the other before again pouring the mixture back into the first vessel, thereby mixing them thoroughly. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a solution to this question: If a priest performed the Temple service while he <span class="gemarra-regular">was standing on top of a vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or on the foot of another </span>priest, his service <span class="gemarra-regular">is disqualified, </span>as the priest must stand directly on the floor of the Temple. The fact that the foot of another person is considered an interposition proves that one type serves as an interposition with regard to another object of the same type. The Gemara rejects this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> foot is different, as he cannot nullify it. </span>The foot of another person cannot be considered nullified with respect to the priest’s foot, but in the case of a vessel it is possible to say that one vessel is nullified in favor of another vessel.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>that Rami bar Ḥama did not refer to the issue of interposition at all. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma he raised before </span>Rav Ḥisda: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is </span>placing one vessel inside another vessel a proper <span class="gemarra-regular">manner of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">service; or is this not </span>a proper <span class="gemarra-regular">manner of service</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and if one does so his service is disqualified? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which the school </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yishmael taught: </span>“And they shall take <span class="gemarra-regular">all the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> service vessels, with which they serve in the Sanctuary” </span>(Numbers 4:12). This verse is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">two vessels and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">service</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which indicates that this is a proper manner of service.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama raised </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda </span>along the same lines: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">he placed bast</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the material that grows around palm trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">inside the bowl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and collected the blood</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>the bowl through the bast, such that the blood seeps through into the bowl? Does one <span class="gemarra-regular">type </span>of object mixed <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">type interpose; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">it does not interpose? </span>Could one say that <span class="gemarra-regular">since the blood seeps </span>through, it therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">does not interpose</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Or perhaps </span>this case is <span class="gemarra-regular">no different, </span>and as there is a foreign object in the vessel it is considered an interposition even if the blood seeps through.
Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>this matter with regard to sanctifying the purification waters, i.e., the water mixed with ashes of the red heifer. If a sponge was placed inside the container of water, the water in the sponge is disqualified and the priest may not sprinkle with it. How should he proceed? <span class="gemarra-regular">He sprinkles </span>from the water <span class="gemarra-regular">and continues until he reaches the sponge. </span>This shows that the presence of the sponge in the water container is not considered an interposition for the water in the container, despite the fact that it itself is unfit for the service. Rami bar Ḥama replied: This is no proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">Water is different, as it is thin </span>and therefore it certainly seeps through the sponge and reaches the bowl; whereas the thicker blood will perhaps not seep into the fiber.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is how </span>Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">resolved</span> the problem of placing the bast in the bowl <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span> Rami bar Ḥama: In the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the blood it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is valid, </span>as blood passes through, and the bast does not obstruct it. However, in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">handful </span>of a meal-offering, which must be sanctified in a vessel immediately after the handful is taken, if he put bast in a vessel and placed the handful on top of it, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is disqualified</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The reason is that the handful of a meal-offering consists of dough, which does not pass through the bast, and it is therefore considered a proper interposition. 

Daf 58b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> It is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall go out to the altar that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is before the Lord</span>, and make atonement for it; and he shall take of the blood of the bull, and of the blood of the goat, and place it upon the corners of the altar round about” (Leviticus 16:18). <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>altar <span class="gemarra-regular">is the golden altar, </span>since the outer altar is not before the Lord in the Sanctuary. <span class="gemarra-regular">He began to cleanse</span> the altar, sprinkling the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">downward</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> From where does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he begin? </span>He begins <span class="gemarra-regular">from the northeast corner, </span>and proceeds to the <span class="gemarra-regular">northwest </span>corner, and then to the <span class="gemarra-regular">southwest </span>corner, and finally to the <span class="gemarra-regular">southeast </span>corner. A way to remember this is: At the <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">he begins </span>sprinkling the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">for a sin-offerin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">on the outer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">altar, </span>the southeast corner, <span class="gemarra-regular">there he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">finishes</span> sprinkling the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">on the inner altar. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>The priest would not circle the altar; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">he stood in </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">place and sprinkle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the blood from there. Since the altar was only one square cubit, he could sprinkle the blood on all four corners without moving. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And on all the corners he would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">present </span>the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">from below upward, except for that </span>corner <span class="gemarra-regular">that was </span>directly <span class="gemarra-regular">before him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> on <span class="gemarra-regular">which he would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">present </span>the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">from above downward. He sprinkled </span>blood <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">pure </span>gold <span class="gemarra-regular">of the alta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seven times </span>after clearing away the ashes. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he would pour the remainder </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the blood on the western base of the outer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">altar. </span>On a related topic, the mishna teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would pour </span>the remaining blood of an offering, after it was sprinkled, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the outer altar, on its southern base</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> These </span>remainders of blood from the outer altar <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>remainders of blood from the inner altar are <span class="gemarra-regular">mixed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the canal </span>beneath the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">and flow out </span>with the water used to rinse the area <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Kidron </span><span class="gemarra-regular">River</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This water was <span class="gemarra-regular">sold to gardeners for </span>use as <span class="gemarra-regular">fertilizer. </span>The gardeners paid for this water and thereby redeemed it from its sanctity. Failure to do so would render them guilty of <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated property. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: “And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he shall go out to the altar” </span>(Leviticus 16:18). <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span> is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states </span>this? Upon his exit, after sprinkling toward the curtain, the High Priest must necessarily reach the golden altar. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because we find with regard to the bull brought for</span> a violation of <span class="gemarra-regular">all the mitzvot, </span>i.e., the bull that must be brought in the event that the community errs with regard to any of the mitzvot, which is called the bull for an unwitting communal sin, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">when the priest sprinkles </span>toward the curtain <span class="gemarra-regular">he stands past </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the altar and sprinkles </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">toward the curtain; </span>therefore, one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought <span class="gemarra-regular">that here, too, </span>the rite should be performed in <span class="gemarra-regular">the same </span>manner. 
Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And he shall go</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out to the altar.” Where was he </span>before? He was <span class="gemarra-regular">on the inner side of the altar, </span>i.e., the western side, close to the curtain, when he sprinkled, not on the outer side of the altar. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to the bull for an unwitting communal sin the verse states: “And he shall sprinkle seven times <span class="gemarra-regular">before the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lord </span>in front of the curtain” (Leviticus 4:17). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: </span>Before the Lord? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Neḥemya said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because we find with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the bull and the goat of Yom Kippur that when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he sprinkles </span>the High <span class="gemarra-regular">Priest stands on the inner side </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the altar, </span>close to the curtain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and sprinkles toward</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the curtain; </span>therefore, one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">too, </span>in the case of the bull for an unwitting communal sin, it should be <span class="gemarra-regular">the same </span>rite. 
Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: </span>“And the priest shall put the blood upon the corners of the <span class="gemarra-regular">altar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of sweet incense before the Lord, which is in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Tent of Meeting” </span>(Leviticus 4:7). This verse teaches that the <span class="gemarra-regular">altar </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">before the Lord, but the priest is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not before the Lord. How so? </span>The priest <span class="gemarra-regular">stands</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the outer side of the altar and sprinkles.</span>
§ The mishna taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">He began to cleanse </span>the altar, sprinkling the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">downward. The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">He began to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cleanse downward. From where would he begin? </span>He would begin <span class="gemarra-regular">from the southeast corner </span>of the altar, and from there he would turn to the <span class="gemarra-regular">southwest </span>corner, onward to the <span class="gemarra-regular">northwest </span>corner, and finally to the <span class="gemarra-regular">northeast </span>corner. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: </span>He began <span class="gemarra-regular">from the northeas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> corner, </span>from which he turned to the <span class="gemarra-regular">northwest </span>corner, then to the <span class="gemarra-regular">southwest </span>corner, and finished at the <span class="gemarra-regular">southeast </span>corner. 
The Gemara notes: The place where the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">begins </span>according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, </span>i.e., the northeast corner, <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>is where <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva </span>says he <span class="gemarra-regular">ends; </span>and the place where the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">begins </span>according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>the southeast corner, <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span> is where <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili </span>says he <span class="gemarra-regular">ends.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Everyone </span>agrees, <span class="gemarra-regular">in any case, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not perform</span> the service <span class="gemarra-regular">at the corner that he encounters first. </span>Since the High Priest approaches the altar from the west side, the first corner he encounters is located on the west side. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that the verse states: “And he shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">go out to the altar,” </span>which indicates that he does not begin <span class="gemarra-regular">until he goes out from </span>the sacred area beyond the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>area of the <span class="gemarra-regular">altar. </span>At this stage, he is no longer on the western side of the altar but on its eastern side. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, let him go</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> around via the right. </span>Since the High Priest is standing at the eastern side of the altar facing the west, the corner on his right is the northeast one. <span class="gemarra-regular">Let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree with regard to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rami bar Yeḥezkel. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rami bar Yeḥezkel said: </span>A verse describes <span class="gemarra-regular">the sea, </span>the basin <span class="gemarra-regular">that Solomon built, </span>in the following terms: <span class="gemarra-regular">“It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> east; and the sea was set upon them above, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all their hinder parts were inward” </span>(II Chronicles 4:4). From the direction in which the text lists the groups of oxen under the basin, <span class="gemarra-regular">you learn that all turns </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that you turn should be only to the right </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">to the east </span>side. Let us say that <span class="gemarra-regular">this Sage, </span>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, <span class="gemarra-regular">is of </span>the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rami bar Yeḥezkel, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this Sage, </span>Rabbi Akiva, <span class="gemarra-regular">is of </span>the opinion that the ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Yeḥezkel. </span>
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, everyone is of </span>the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yeḥezkel, but here they disagree with regard to this </span>matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">One Sage, </span>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: We derive </span>the order of the rite <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the Sanctuary <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the manner of the sprinkling on the <span class="gemarra-regular">outside: </span>Just as the priest sprinkles on the corners of the outer altar in that order, he sprinkles similarly on the inner altar. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sage, </span>Rabbi Akiva, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds: We do not derive </span>the order of the rite <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>of the Sanctuary <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the rite performed <span class="gemarra-regular">outside. </span>
§ The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, although</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he does not derive </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">inside from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">outside, </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">wants, let him perform </span>the rite in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>manner, and <span class="gemarra-regular">if he wants, let him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perform </span>the rite in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>manner. Why must he begin specifically at the southeast corner? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: </span>Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">by righ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">should begin </span>sprinkling <span class="gemarra-regular">by that corner </span>of the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he reaches first, as Reish Lakish said: One does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pass on </span>an opportunity to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot. </span>If one has the chance to perform a mitzva, he should not put it off for later but should do it immediately. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And why does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he not do </span>so; why does the High Priest not begin the sprinkling on one of the western corners? This is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “He shall go </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out to the altar,” </span>meaning that he does not begin <span class="gemarra-regular">until he goes out from </span>the area of the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> altar. And since he presents </span>the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">at that corner</span> on the outside of the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">he then comes to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that corner </span>on the west side <span class="gemarra-regular">where he should have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> presented </span>the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">first. </span>

Daf 59a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we hold </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">encircling </span>is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by foot, </span>i.e., the priest walks around the inner altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">agrees that we learn </span>the method of sprinkling <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>from the sprinkling <span class="gemarra-regular">outside.

<span class="gemarra-regular">The one</span> who said that he encircled by foot <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>the following <span class="gemarra-regular">reason for his statement: The perimeter of the inner altar</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">like the perimeter of the outer altar, </span>which is encircled by foot for sprinkling. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the one </span>who said that he encircled by hand <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>the following <span class="gemarra-regular">reason for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his statement: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">entire inner altar stands in place of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one corner of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">outer </span>altar. Just as for one corner of the outer altar, the priest sprinkles the blood by hand, the same applies to the entire inner altar.
§ It was taught in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eliezer says: He stood in </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">place and sprinkled </span>the blood from there. The Gemara asks: In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion is <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna? </span>The Gemara answers: The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who explained Rabbi Eliezer’s ruling in the following manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, later <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> disagreed with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Meir says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">He stood </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">place and sprinkled, and on all </span>of the corners <span class="gemarra-regular">he presented </span>the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">from above downward, </span>so as not to drip blood down the sleeve of his garment, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for that </span>corner <span class="gemarra-regular">on the diagonal [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">alakhson</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> across from him. Since it was difficult for him to sprinkle on that corner from top to bottom, <span class="gemarra-regular">he sprinkled from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">below upward. </span>
Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: He stood in </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">place and sprinkled, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and on all of </span>the corners <span class="gemarra-regular">he sprinkled from below </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upward, </span>as it is more convenient to sprinkle in that manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for that one which was directly before him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, on which he would present from above downward. </span>The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">so as not to dirty his garments </span>with blood. If he sprinkled on the corner next to him from below upward, the blood might fall on his clothes, and he would have to change garments, as dirty priestly garments may not be worn for the Temple service.
§ The mishna taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">He sprinkled </span>blood <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">pure </span>gold <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tohoro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of the altar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the term <span class="gemarra-italic">tohoro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rabba bar Rav Sheila said: </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">altar, as people </span>commonly <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Tehar</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tihara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the light of noon shines <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is the middle of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day. </span>Here, too, <span class="it-text">tohoro</span> of the altar means half the altar, i.e., he sprinkled on the midpoint of the altar wall. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection: When he sprinkles </span>on the inner altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">he sprinkles neither on top of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor on top of the coals; rather, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rakes </span>and removes <span class="gemarra-regular">the coals to both sides and sprinkles.</span> This indicates that this sprinkling was performed on top of the altar, not on its side. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabba bar Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sheila </span>retracted his previous interpretation and said: On <span class="it-text">tohoro</span> of the altar means <span class="gemarra-regular">on the exposed </span>area <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">altar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is written: “And the like of the very</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> heaven for clearness [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">letohar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Exodus 24:10), which shows that <span class="it-text">tohar</span> is an expression of clarity.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya says: </span>The priest <span class="gemarra-regular">presents </span>seven sprinklings <span class="gemarra-regular">on the north</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> side </span>of the altar, and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: He presents</span> them <span class="gemarra-regular">on the south side. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to what </span>principle do <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">One Sage, </span>Ḥananya, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the entrance </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">positioned in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the south, </span>and therefore the High Priest begins the sprinklings from that side. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one Sage, </span>Rabbi Yosei, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the entrance </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">positioned in the north</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and he therefore begins to sprinkle on the altar from the north side.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Everyone </span>agrees <span class="gemarra-regular">in any case </span>that in the place <span class="gemarra-regular">where he finishes the presentations </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">corners, that </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">where he places </span>the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the altar’s <span class="gemarra-regular">top</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>They disagree only about the location of the final presentation, whether it is on the south or the north side. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this agreement? The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: </span>“And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, <span class="gemarra-regular">and cleanse it and sanctify it” </span>(Leviticus 16:19), which indicates that the <span class="gemarra-regular">place he sanctified </span>by sprinkling blood, the corner of the altar where he sprinkled last, <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he shall </span>also begin to <span class="gemarra-regular">cleanse </span>and sprinkle on top.
§ The mishna taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he would pour the remainder of the blood on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">western base of the outer altar. </span>The Gemara explains: The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that the verse states </span>with regard to the sin-offering bull of the High Priest during the rest of the year: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall pour out all the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blood of the bull </span>at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 4:7), <span class="gemarra-regular">and when he goes out</span> from the Sanctuary to pour the remainder of the blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">he first reaches that </span>western side of the base of the altar.
§ The mishna further taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he would pour</span> the remaining blood after the blood of an offering was sprinkled <span class="gemarra-regular">on the outer altar, on its southern base. The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The base of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">altar” </span>(Leviticus 4:30), which is mentioned with regard to pouring the remainder of the blood of an individual offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the southern base. </span>Do <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the southern</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> base? Or perhaps that is not </span>the case, but <span class="gemarra-regular">rather</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the western base? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">You said: Let his descent from the ramp </span>of the outer altar after sprinkling blood from the sin-offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> derived from his exit from the Sanctuary </span>with the remaining blood in his hand: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>upon <span class="gemarra-regular">his exit from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Sanctuary </span>he pours the remainder of the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span> the side <span class="gemarra-regular">closest to him, and which is that, it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the western base; so too, </span>upon <span class="gemarra-regular">his descent from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the ramp </span>of the outer altar after sprinkling blood from a sin-offering, he pours the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the side <span class="gemarra-regular">closest to him, and which is that? It is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the southern base, </span>as when he descends from the ramp he turns to the right, i.e., the east, which means the southern base is the one closest to him. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael says: </span>Both <span class="gemarra-regular">this and that, </span>the blood of an inner sin-offering and that of an outer sin-offering, were spilled at <span class="gemarra-regular">the western base </span>of the altar. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: </span>Both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>blood were spilled at <span class="gemarra-regular">the southern base. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, Rabbi Yishmael maintains </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of outer sin-offerings, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">not clarified </span>in the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived from </span>the inner sin-offerings, whose <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">explicit: </span>Just as the remains of the inner sprinklings are poured at the western base, so too, the remains of the outer sprinklings are poured at the western base. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Yoḥai, what is the reason </span>that he holds that both sets of remainders of blood are spilled at the southern base? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">entrance </span>of the Sanctuary <span class="gemarra-regular">is positioned at the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">south </span>side of the altar, i.e., the altar is not located in the middle of the courtyard but to the north. Consequently, the southern base of the altar is closest to the High Priest’s exit from the Sanctuary.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught </span>a different version of his opinion, which they learned <span class="gemarra-regular">in the school of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon ben Yoḥai: </span>Both <span class="gemarra-regular">this and that, </span>the blood of an inner sin-offering and that of an outer sin-offering, were presented at <span class="gemarra-regular">the southern base. </span>According to this version, Rabbi Yishmael changed his opinion and agreed with Rabbi Shimon. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And your mnemonic </span>to remember the shift in opinion is: <span class="gemarra-regular">The men pulled the man</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the majority overruled the individual. In this case, the numerous students of Rabbi Shimon convinced the individual Sage, Rabbi Yishmael, to accept their ruling.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">These </span>remainders of blood from the outer altar <span class="gemarra-regular">and those </span>remainders of blood from the inner altar are <span class="gemarra-regular">mixed in the canal </span>beneath the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">and flow out </span>with the water used to rinse the area to the Kidron River, where they are sold to gardeners. Any blood that was not redeemed was subject to the prohibition against misuse of consecrated property. <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sages taught: </span>One who takes these remainders without redeeming them <span class="gemarra-regular">misuses </span>property consecrated in the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>unlawfully using <span class="gemarra-regular">blood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is consecrated and is Temple property. It is prohibited to use consecrated objects for mundane purposes, and one who does so is committing the sin of misusing consecrated property. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon. And the Rabbis say: </span>One does <span class="gemarra-regular">not misuse </span>consecrated property <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>benefiting from <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>remainders of the blood of offerings. 

Daf 59b

The Gemara comments: The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree only with regard to </span>misuse of consecrated property that applies <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it was the Sages who prohibited the use of blood; <span class="gemarra-regular">however</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>everyone agrees that <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law </span>one does <span class="gemarra-regular">not misuse</span> consecrated property <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>benefiting from <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>remainders of blood. Clearly, the Temple treasurers would not have sold it to gardeners <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span> had the Torah prohibited the use of this blood (<span class="it-text">Tosafot</span>). 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters, </span>that there is no misuse for blood, derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verse states: </span>“For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it <span class="gemarra-regular">to you </span>upon the altar to make atonement for your souls” (Leviticus 17:11). “To you” indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">it shall be yours. </span>It is not the property of the Temple; rather, it belongs to all of the Jewish people. <span class="gemarra-regular">The school </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>that the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“to make atonement” </span>teaches that God says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I gave it for atonement and not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated objects.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said </span>that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is derived from a different phrase. <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: </span>“For <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life” (Leviticus 17:11), which indicates that it retains the same status <span class="gemarra-regular">before atonement as after atonement: Just as after atonement </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not subject to </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated objects, as the mitzva has been performed, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before atonement it is not subject to misuse </span>of consecrated objects. As the Gemara states below, there is a general principle that once the mitzva involving a certain object has been performed, the object is no longer subject to misuse of consecrated objects. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the status of blood before atonement is compared to its status after atonement, one can <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>the opposite: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as before atonement it is subject to misuse </span>of consecrated objects, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, after atonement it is subject </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to misuse </span>of consecrated objects. The Gemara rejects this contention: This cannot be the case, as there is a general principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is nothing whose mitzva has been performe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">subject to misuse </span>of consecrated property. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is there <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>such case? <span class="gemarra-regular">But there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the instance of the <span class="gemarra-regular">removal of the ashes </span>of offerings burned on the altar. These ashes require burial, and yet any benefit derived from them is misuse of consecrated property, despite the fact that their mitzva has already been performed. 

Daf 60a

The Gemara answers: The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">the removal of the ashe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the priestly vestments, </span>the four white garments worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur, are both subject to the special <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that misuse of consecrated objects applies to them even after their mitzva has been performed. Consequently, they are <span class="gemarra-regular">two verses that come as one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., they share a unique <span class="it-text">halakha</span> not found elsewhere. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> there is a principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any two verses that come as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one do not teach, </span>i.e., an analogy may not be derived from these two similar cases. Instead, they are considered exceptional instances that cannot serve as models for other cases. 
§ The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, who say </span>that the verse: “And he shall take off the linen garments, which he wore when he went into the sacred place, <span class="gemarra-regular">and shall leave</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them there” </span>(Leviticus 16:23), <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that </span>the four white garments worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur are not fit for further use, and <span class="gemarra-regular">they require interment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa, who said </span>that these <span class="gemarra-regular">priestly vestments </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are fit for a common priest </span>and do not require interment, one does not misuse consecrated property by using them, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say? </span>In his opinion, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of misuse of consecrated objects after the performance of a mitzva applies only to the removal of ashes from the altar, not to the priestly vestments, which means it is stated in only a single case. Why, then, does this case not serve as a model for other instances in the Torah? 
The Gemara responds: The reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the cases of the <span class="gemarra-regular">removal of the ashes and the heifer whose neck is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> broke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are two verses that come as one, </span>as it is prohibited to derive benefit from either of them even after their mitzva is completed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and any two verses</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that come as one do not teach </span>their common feature to other cases. The heifer whose neck is broken is a ritual performed when a murder victim’s body is found outside a town, and it is not known who caused his death.
The Gemara challenges this reply from a different angle: <span class="gemarra-regular">It works out well according to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one who said </span>that two verses that come as one <span class="gemarra-regular">do not teach </span>their common feature to other cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> according to the one who says that two verses that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> come as one </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>with regard to other cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Two exclusions</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are written </span>in these two cases, which indicate that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies to them alone. With respect to the removal of ashes, it states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall put it”</span> (Leviticus 6:3), implying “it” and nothing else. With regard to the heifer whose neck is broken, it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Whose neck was broken” </span>(Deuteronomy 21:6), which teaches that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies solely to this case. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> if this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is derived from those two cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">these three verses </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to blood, </span>from which it is derived that the prohibition against misuse of consecrated objects does not apply to the remainder of blood that flows to the Kidron River? The reference is to the three phrases singled out above from the verse: “I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life” (Leviticus 17:11). 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>of those phrases comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exclude </span>the blood from the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-italic">notar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>offerings that remain after the time when they may be eaten has expired. If one ate leftover blood, he is not punished with <span class="it-text">karet</span>, as generally incurred by one who consumes <span class="it-text">notar</span>. Rather, he is liable only for violating the prohibition against eating blood. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one </span>phrase comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated objects, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>other phrase comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from ritual impurity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If one ate this blood in a state of ritual impurity, he is liable only for the transgression of eating blood, but not on account of eating consecrated food while ritually impure. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, no verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is required to exclude </span>this blood <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>an offering disqualified by improper intention, because this is already derived from another source, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>offering <span class="gemarra-regular">that has </span>another rite that <span class="gemarra-regular">permits it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> e.g., an offering that is permitted by the sprinkling of blood or by means of a second offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">one is liable to </span>receive <span class="it-text">karet</span> if he eats it after it is rendered <span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This is the case <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the other rite permits it <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">human </span>consumption <span class="gemarra-regular">or whether </span>it enables the offering to be sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">on the altar. </span>However, the permitting factor itself is not subject to <span class="it-text">piggul</span>. Consequently, <span class="it-text">piggul</span> does not apply to <span class="gemarra-regular">blood itself, </span>as it renders the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for human consumption or for the altar.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Each action </span>performed in the context of the service <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yom Kippur stated </span>in the mishna, as in the Torah, is listed <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">order</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">performed</span> one of the <span class="gemarra-regular">actions before another, he has done nothing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he performed </span>the sprinkling of <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the goat before </span>the sprinkling of <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bull</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">repeat </span>the action <span class="gemarra-regular">and sprinkle the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">blood of the goat after </span>sprinkling <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bull, </span>so that the actions are performed in the proper order. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if the blood spills before he completed the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> presentations that </span>were sprinkled <span class="gemarra-regular">insid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>must slaughter another bull or goat, and <span class="gemarra-regular">bring other </span><span class="gemarra-regular">blood, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">repeat </span>all the services <span class="gemarra-regular">from the beginning </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the Holy of Holies.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly,</span> if the blood spills before he finishes the presentations <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Sanctuary, </span>he must begin the service in the Sanctuary from the beginning, <span class="gemarra-regular">and likewise </span>with regard to the sprinkling of blood <span class="gemarra-regular">on the golden altar. Since they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> each </span>acts of <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement in and of themselves, </span>there is no need to repeat the service of the entire day from the beginning. Rather, he need only repeat the specific element that he failed to complete. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon say: From the place that he interrupted </span>that particular service, when the blood spilled, <span class="gemarra-regular">there he resumes </span>performance of that service. In their opinion, each individual sprinkling in each of these services is an act in and of itself, and there is no need to repeat what he has already done.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: Each</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> action </span>performed in the context of the service <span class="gemarra-regular">of Yom</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Kippur stated </span>in the Torah is listed <span class="gemarra-regular">in order. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">performed </span>one of the <span class="gemarra-regular">actions before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another, he has done nothing. Rabbi Yehuda said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Whe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> does this apply? It applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to those actions performed in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">white garments inside </span>the Sanctuary, e.g., burning the incense and sprinkling the blood, which are the essential services of the day. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">those actions performed in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">white garments outside, </span>such as the lottery and the confession, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he performed </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">action before another, what he did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is done </span>and he need not repeat the rite. 
In contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya says: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> statement said, </span>that the order is indispensable? It is said with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to actions performed in white garments, whether </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inside or outside </span>the Sanctuary. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">actions performed in golden garments outside </span>the Sanctuary, the regular Temple service and additional services, if the order was altered, <span class="gemarra-regular">what he did is done. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And both</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of them, </span>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, <span class="gemarra-regular">derived </span>their opinions <span class="gemarra-regular">from one verse: “And this shall be an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">everlasting statute to you, </span>to make atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins <span class="gemarra-regular">once a year” </span>(Leviticus 16:34). 

Daf 60b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda maintains </span>that this is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">place where atonement is achieve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> once a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> year, </span>namely the Holy of Holies. In his opinion, the order of actions is indispensable for the services performed in the Holy of Holies. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Neḥemya maintains </span>that the verse is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the actions through which atonement </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is achieved once a year, </span>meaning both the place and the garments. Consequently, in the opinion of Rabbi Neḥemya, the order for all actions performed in white clothes is indispensable.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that to say</span> that according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">written? </span>The verse merely states “once a year,” which apparently is referring to the order of the service in general but not to a specific place. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather,</span> the Gemara retracts the previous explanation in favor of the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda: It is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: “This” </span>(Leviticus 16:34), which is a term of restriction and limitation, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written: “Once </span>a year” (Leviticus 16:34), another term of restriction. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>restriction comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exclude </span>actions performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">white garments outside </span>the Sanctuary, meaning that they are not indispensable; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one </span>restriction comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>actions performed <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">gold garments. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya </span>interpret these two restricting expressions? In his opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of the restrictions comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>actions performed in the <span class="gemarra-regular">gold garments, and one</span> restriction comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">remainders </span>of blood that are poured at the base of the altar, meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">are not indispensable. </span>If the High Priest performed a service that is supposed to come after the spilling of the blood too early, the service is valid, despite the fact that the spilling of the blood is performed in white garments. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>maintain with regard to the remainders of blood? The Gemara answers: In his opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the other actions performed outside are <span class="gemarra-regular">indispensable, </span>this too is <span class="gemarra-regular">indispensable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and if </span>the other acts performed outside are <span class="gemarra-regular">not indispensable, </span>the remainders are <span class="gemarra-regular">not indispensable </span>either. The pouring of the remainders of blood is no different from the sprinkling of blood in this regard.
In proof that Rabbi Yehuda maintains that pouring the remainders of blood is no different from the sprinkling of blood, the Gemara cites a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that is referring to a case where the pouring of the remainders of the blood is entirely omitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And when</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he has finished atoning for the sacred place” </span>(Leviticus 16:20). This verse indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">if he performed the atonement, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he has finished </span>the order of the service; <span class="gemarra-regular">and if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he did not perform the atonement, he has not finished.</span> This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yehuda said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: Why do we not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> finished </span>sprinkling all the blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has performed atonement; and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if he did not finish, he has not performed atonement</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>This would indicate <span class="gemarra-regular">that if one of the presentations is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lacking </span>it is as though <span class="gemarra-regular">he did nothing. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we say </span>in this regard: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them? Rabbi Yoḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi </span>debated this point. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">said: There is </span>a difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the source from which they derive their interpretation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., there is no halakhic difference between them but only a dispute as to how to interpret the verses. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one said: There is </span>a difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with respect to whether pouring the <span class="gemarra-regular">remainders </span>of blood at the base of the altar is <span class="gemarra-regular">indispensable </span>to the atonement. According to Rabbi Akiva, it is not indispensable, whereas Rabbi Yehuda maintains that it is indispensable. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And did Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this, </span>that in Rabbi Neḥemya’s opinion pouring the remainders of blood is not indispensable? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in tractate <span class="it-text">Zevaḥim</span> (111a): <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya taught in accordance with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of the one who said that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">remainders </span>of blood <span class="gemarra-regular">are indispensable? </span>The Gemara comments: Indeed, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">incense that </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">scooped before the slaughterin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of the bull, </span>it is as though <span class="gemarra-regular">he did nothing.</span> The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with </span>whose opinion is this statement? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. As, if </span>you say it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, didn’t </span>Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when it is written “statute” </span>(Leviticus 16:34), a term that indicates that no details may be altered, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to actions performed in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">white garments within </span>the Sanctuary, whereas scooping incense is done outside? 
The Gemara rejects this claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that Rabbi Ḥanina holds in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>it is possible that in his opinion scooping the incense <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the purpose of </span>it being taken <span class="gemarra-regular">inside is considered like </span>an action actually performed <span class="gemarra-regular">inside. </span>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">if the blood spills</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">completed the presentations that </span>were sprinkled <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>must slaughter another bull or goat, <span class="gemarra-regular">bring other blood, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkle again from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the beginning inside. And if it is so, </span>that an action performed outside the Sanctuary for the purpose of a service inside the Sanctuary is considered like an action actually performed inside, merely slaughtering the bull and sprinkling the blood again should be insufficient. Instead, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">should have said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">he must return and scoop </span>the incense anew. The fact that the mishna did not say this proves that the order of scooping the incense is not indispensable. 

Daf 61a

The Gemara answers that this is no proof, as <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not dealing with the incense. </span>In practice, the High Priest must indeed go back and scoop new incense after slaughtering the bull. The mishna did not mention this detail because it is discussing the issue of the sprinkling of blood, not the incense service.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a goat that he slaughtered before presentation</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the blood of the bull</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is as though <span class="gemarra-regular">he did nothing. </span>The Gemara asks: But <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in the mishna that if <span class="gemarra-regular">he performed </span>the sprinkling of <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood of the goat before </span>the sprinkling of <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood of the bull, he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">repeat </span>the action <span class="gemarra-regular">and sprinkle the blood of the goat after </span>sprinkling <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">blood of the bull. And if it is so </span>that Ulla is correct, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">should have said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must return and slaughter </span>another bull. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla interpreted </span>the mishna as referring only <span class="gemarra-regular">to the presentations </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the Sanctuary </span>that were performed out of order. However, it is essential that the presentations in the Holy of Holies must be performed before the slaughter of the goat. <span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise, Rabbi Afe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the presentations in the Sanctuary.</span>
§ The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly in the Sanctuary, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and likewise on the golden altar, </span>if the blood spills he must go back and begin that cycle of sprinklings afresh. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>“And he shall make atonement for the most sacred place, and he shall make atonement for the Tent of Meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly” (Leviticus 16:33). <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> make atonement for the most sacred place,” this is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the innermost sanctum</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the Holy of Holies; <span class="gemarra-regular">“the Tent</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Meeting,” this is the Sanctuary; “altar” </span>is meant <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> per its plain meaning; “he shall make atonement,” is </span>referring to the second mention of this phrase in the verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">these are the courtyards. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">“The priests” </span>is meant <span class="gemarra-regular">as per its plain meaning</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; “people of the assembly,” these are the Israelites; “he shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> make atonement,” these are the Levites</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who also gain atonement. <span class="gemarra-regular">They are all equated </span>in this verse <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>that they achieve <span class="gemarra-regular">one atonement </span>in this verse, which indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they all achieve atonement through the scapegoat </span>for all <span class="gemarra-regular">other</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> transgressions, </span>apart from the ritual impurity of the Temple and consecrated objects, i.e., entering the Temple or eating consecrated food while ritually impure. The bull presented inside atones only for the priests, while the goats atone solely for Israelites. Only the scapegoat atones equally for all Jews. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: Just as the blood of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> goat presented inside atones for Israelites </span>who sinned <span class="gemarra-regular">with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ritual impurity of the Temple and its consecrated objects, so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> too, the blood of the </span>High Priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">bull atones</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the priests </span>who sinned <span class="gemarra-regular">with the ritual impurity of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Temple and its consecrated objects. And just as the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> confession over the scapegoat atones for Israelites with regard to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all other transgressions, so too, the confession over the bull</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> atones for the priests with regard to all other transgressions</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and therefore the priests do not require atonement through the scapegoat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: “And when he has finished atoning for the sacred place, and the Tent of Meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat” (Leviticus 16:20). <span class="gemarra-regular">“And when he has finished atoning </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for the sacred place,” this is </span>the sprinklings in <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">innermost sanctum, </span>the Holy of Holies; <span class="gemarra-regular">“Tent of Meeting,” this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the </span>sprinklings toward the curtain in the <span class="gemarra-regular">Sanctuary; “altar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” as per its plain meaning. </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that they each</span> constitute <span class="gemarra-regular">a separate atonement unto themselves, </span>i.e., each one of these actions achieves a distinct atonement. If a disqualification occurs in any of the atoning actions, he must return to the beginning of that action.
<span class="gemarra-regular">From here </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">stated:</span> If the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">presented some of the presentations inside</span> the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood spilled, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he brings other blood and begins from the start of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the presentations inside. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say: </span>He need not start the cycle of sprinklings again; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> begins only from the place where he stopped. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he finished the presentations inside and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood spilled</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he brings other blood and starts at the beginning </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the presentations in the Sanctuary. </span>However, he does not begin the presentations inside anew, as he has already sprinkled all the required blood inside, and that stage of the service is complete. 
If <span class="gemarra-regular">he presented </span><span class="gemarra-regular">some of the presentations in the Sanctuary and the blood </span><span class="gemarra-regular">spilled, he brings other blood and begins </span>again <span class="gemarra-regular">from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">start in the Sanctuary, </span>as he has not yet completed all the sprinklings in the Sanctuary. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon say: He begins only from the place where he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stopped. </span>
If <span class="gemarra-regular">he finished the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">presentations in the Sanctuary and the blood spilled</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brings other blood and begins at the start of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">presentations at the altar, </span>as he has already achieved the atonement of the sprinklings in the Sanctuary. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he presented</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> some of the presentations at the altar and the blood</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spilled, he brings other blood and begins at the start</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the presentations at the altar, </span>as the atonement of the altar has yet not been completed. In this case, too, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">begins from the place where he stopped. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he finished</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the presentations at the altar and the blood spille</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> before he poured the remainder of the blood at the base of the outer altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that the remainders <span class="gemarra-regular">are not indispensable, </span>and he need not slaughter another offering for this mitzva.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan said: And both of them, </span>meaning the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, i.e., Rabbi Meir, the accepted author of unattributed <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span>, Rabbi Elazar, and Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">derived </span>their opinions <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one verse: </span>“And Aaron shall make atonement upon its corners once a year; <span class="gemarra-regular">with the blood of the sin-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of atonement once a year </span>he shall make atonement for it throughout your generations; it is most sacred to the Lord” (Exodus 30:10). 
Rabbi Yoḥanan elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir holds </span>that God said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I said to you </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">one sin-offering and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not two sin-offerings. </span>In other words, the High Priest may not sprinkle the blood of two offerings on the inner altar. Consequently, if the blood of the sin-offering spilled in the middle of the rite, he may not complete the presentation with the blood of another animal; rather, he must slaughter new offerings so that he can present all the sprinklings at the altar from one sin-offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon hold </span>that God said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I said to you </span>to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">one sprinkling and not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two sprinklings. </span>If he already sprinkled once, the High Priest need not sprinkle again, and if the blood spilled in the middle, the rite is completed with the blood of another offering.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Rabbi Ya’akov differentiated for me </span>with respect <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">lugin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>In other words, Rabbi Ya’akov said that although Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon disagree with Rabbi Meir with respect to the sprinkling on Yom Kippur, maintaining that the High Priest restarts from where he stopped, if some of the oil from the <span class="it-text">log</span> used for purifying the leper spills in the middle of the sprinkling, these <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> do not disagree that the priest must start that rite afresh.
The Gemara expresses surprise at this claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>do they <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>disagree with regard to this issue as well? <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it taught </span>explicitly in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he presented some</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the presentations </span>of oil <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he sprinkles <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spilled</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he brings another </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and begins from the start of the presentations in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sanctuary; </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say: He begins</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the place where he stopped. </span>
Likewise, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he finished the presentations in the Sanctuary</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spilled, he brings another </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and begins</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the start of the presentations </span>that he puts on <span class="gemarra-regular">the thumbs </span>of the leper. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he put some of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the presentations on </span>the leper’s <span class="gemarra-regular">thumbs and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spilled, he brings another </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and begins from the start</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the presentations on </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">thumbs. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon say: He begins from the place where he stopped</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he finished the presentations on his thumbs and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spilled, everyone agrees </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the presentations on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">head are not indispensable. </span>This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> proves that Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon also disagree with Rabbi Meir with regard to the purifying oil of the leper. 
The Gemara answers: Rather, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement must be amended, as one should <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Rabbi Ya’akov taught me </span>this dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">lugin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Just as there is a dispute with regard to spilled blood during the presentations on Yom Kippur, Rabbi Ya’akov taught that a similar dispute applies to the leper’s <span class="it-text">log</span> of oil.
The Gemara analyzes this issue: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>above that everyone agrees that the <span class="gemarra-regular">presentations of </span>oil placed on <span class="gemarra-regular">the head </span>of the leper <span class="gemarra-regular">are not indispensable.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> we say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is written: “And the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rest of the oil </span>that is in the priest’s hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be purified, to make atonement for him before the Lord” (Leviticus 14:29), which indicates that this presentation involves only the rest of the oil and is therefore not an essential element of atonement, <span class="gemarra-regular">however, if </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>consider the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But the rest of the meal-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering </span>shall be for Aharon and his sons; it is one of the sacred offerings of the Lord by fire” (Leviticus 2:3). Should we say, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, that they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not indispensable? </span>This cannot be the case, as the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that if the remnants of the meal-offering are lost before the handful is burnt, the owner of the offering must bring another handful. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is different there, </span>with regard to the leper’s <span class="it-text">log</span> of oil, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written </span>earlier: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the rest </span>of the oil that is in his hand, the priest shall put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be purified, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the big toe of his right foot” (Leviticus 14:17), and it is also written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And of the rest </span>of the oil that is in the priest’s hand, he shall put upon the head of him that is to be purified” (Leviticus 14:18). This shows that the presentation on the head is performed only with the remainder of the oil, and therefore this action is certainly not indispensable. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>

Daf 61b

With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a leper’s guilt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offering that was slaughtered not for its own sake</span> but for the purpose of a burnt-offering or peace-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">we have arrived at the dispute between Rabbi Meir</span> on the one hand <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon</span> on the other hand. Rabbi Yoḥanan clarifies his statement: According to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who said </span>that in the case of a service that was not completed <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brings another </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and starts from the beginning, here too</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in the case of the leper’s guilt-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brings another </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughters </span>it, as Rabbi Meir maintains that a service that has not been completed is considered as though it had not been performed at all. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon, who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he begins from the place where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he stopped, here he has no remedy. </span>According to their opinion, a service that has not been completed properly remains valid. In this case, once he has slaughtered the animal he cannot bring a second guilt-offering, as the verse states: “And offer it for a guilt-offering” (Leviticus 14:12), and not two guilt-offerings.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥisda strongly objects to this: But isn’t it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written: </span>“And offer <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>for a guilt-offering” (Leviticus 14:12), which indicates that he must offer that same guilt-offering he waved earlier, and if he does not do so the rite is invalid? If so, even according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, he cannot use another offering. The Gemara comments: Indeed, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> for Rabbi Yoḥanan. 
Even so, it <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a leper’s guilt-offering that </span>the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for its own sake, or </span>if the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> put some of its blood on </span>the leper’s <span class="gemarra-regular">thumbs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, this </span>guilt-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">is raised </span>and sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">on the altar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and requires libations </span>as though it were valid. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>yet the leper <span class="gemarra-regular">must </span>bring <span class="gemarra-regular">another guilt-offering to make him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eligible, </span>i.e., pure of his leprosy. Evidently, there is an opinion that he may offer another guilt-offering, which apparently contradicts the opinion of Rav Ḥisda that everyone agrees that he cannot use another offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥisda </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: What </span>is the meaning of the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">Must, </span>stated here? It means that <span class="gemarra-regular">he must </span>do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>since it is impossible <span class="gemarra-regular">he has no </span><span class="gemarra-regular">remedy. </span>
The Gemara expresses surprise at this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">But would a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teach: Must, </span>when he means that <span class="gemarra-regular">he has no remedy? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to a totally <span class="gemarra-regular">bald nazirite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who cannot shave his hair with a razor as required, <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must </span>perform the act of <span class="gemarra-regular">the passing of a razor</span> anyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel say: He need not </span>perform the act of <span class="gemarra-regular">the passing of a razor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Avina said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Beit Shammai say: Must, </span>they mean <span class="gemarra-regular">he must </span>do so, but since it is impossible, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has no remedy. </span>
The Gemara comments: And Rabbi Avina, in his interpretation of this matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees with Rabbi Pedat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. As Rabbi Pedat said: Beit Shammai and Rabbi Elazar said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the same thing, </span>i.e., they have the same opinion in this regard. The opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that which we said, </span>that a bald nazirite must pass a razor over his head. The opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a mishna: A leper who <span class="gemarra-regular">has no thum</span><span class="gemarra-regular">b</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or big toe </span>on which to sprinkle can <span class="gemarra-regular">never </span>attain <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual purity. Rabbi Elazar says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The priest <span class="gemarra-regular">puts it on the spot </span>where the thumb was, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">fulfills </span>his obligation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: If he put it on the left </span>hand or foot, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has fulfilled </span>his obligation. According to Rabbi Pedat, Rabbi Elazar and Beit Shammai both maintain that even if the rite cannot be performed in the precise manner, one fulfills his obligation regardless. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>“And the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">shall take of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the blood of the guilt-offering, </span>and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him who is to be purified, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the big toe of his right foot” (Leviticus 14:14). One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that he should take it <span class="gemarra-regular">in a vessel; </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “And put.” Just as putting </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">with the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">priest’s own </span>body, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, taking </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> priest’s own </span>body. 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with regard to the blood of the leper’s guilt-offering that he presents <span class="gemarra-regular">on the altar, </span>like the blood of other guilt-offerings, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>that he collects the blood in his hand rather than with a vessel. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “For as the sin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offering is, so is the guilt-offering” </span>(Leviticus 14:13): <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as a sin-offering requires a vessel </span>for collection of its blood, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>the blood of <span class="gemarra-regular">a guilt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offering requires </span>collection in <span class="gemarra-regular">a vessel. And you find that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">say: The leper’s guilt-offering </span>requires <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> priests </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">collect its blood; one </span>collects <span class="gemarra-regular">by hand, and</span> the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>collects <span class="gemarra-regular">in a vessel. The one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> collected in a vessel comes to the altar </span>and sprinkles some of the blood on it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> collected by hand comes to the leper </span>and sprinkles some of the blood on him.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: And all </span>of the animals whose blood was spilled, as stated in the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">render ritually impure the garment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of those who are occupied with burning them. If a bull or goat was slaughtered, but their blood spilled after one stage of atonement, and another animal is brought to complete the sprinkling, the first animal is burned, an action that renders ritually impure the garments of the individuals who perform the burning. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>each of <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>first animals <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> burne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the place of the ashes, </span>in accordance with the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of inner sin-offerings. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">statement of Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon. And the Rabbis </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: They do not render </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">garments impure and they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are not burned in the place of the ashes, except </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for the last </span>animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement is completed with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inquired before Rav Naḥman: How many goats does he send</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> away</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> If the blood of the goat presented inside is spilled, the High Priest must bring an additional pair of goats and perform a new lottery. This might even happen several times, which would mean that one goat is offered on the altar while several goats are designated for sending away. What should be done with those goats? <span class="gemarra-regular">He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to him: Does he send away his flock? </span>In other words, the Torah said to send only one goat, not an entire flock. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>

Daf 62a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And does he burn his flock? </span>The Torah obligated him to burn only one goat, and yet there are times when he must burn several, as stated in the mishna. Rabbi Naḥman retorts: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it comparable? There, </span>with respect to burning the goats, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not written: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">“It,” </span>which would restrict the burning to only one animal, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to the scapegoat, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “It,” </span>which indicates that one animal alone is sent away. The objection has been refuted and indeed only one scapegoat is used. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated</span> that <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed about the following issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said in the name of Rava: He sends the first</span> goat; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rav Shimi said in the name of Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: He sends the last </span>of them. The Gemara analyzes the matter: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shimi bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ashi in the name of Rava, who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sends the last </span>of them, it works out well, as <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>probably <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>as stated above, that the last goat is used, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement is completed with it. However</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappi in the name of Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what does he hold? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He holds </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>who said that when several identical items are available for a mitzva, the <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva is </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">with the first </span>of them.
The Gemara asks: To <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>of the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei </span>is this referring? From which of Rabbi Yosei’s statements is this conclusion derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">containers, </span>this is problematic. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span>There were <span class="gemarra-regular">three</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> container</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of three </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> each, with which they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> collect the donation from the chamber</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Every year the money donated to the Temple by the people in the month of Adar was placed in a special chamber. The treasurers subsequently filled three containers with these coins and used the funds to purchase the communal offerings, e.g., the daily offerings and the additional offerings for Festivals. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the letters <span class="gemarra-italic">alef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gimmel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were written on the </span>containers. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said: Why were </span>the letters <span class="gemarra-italic">alef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gimmel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written on them? </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">to ascertain </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">which of them the donation was collected </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first, </span>so that they could <span class="gemarra-regular">bring </span>the money <span class="gemarra-regular">from it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first, as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva is </span>to use the coins <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>container. This apparently proves that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, it is a mitzva to use the first item. 
The Gemara responds: This is no proof, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps at the time when the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>container <span class="gemarra-regular">was fit to be used, the last was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">fit to be used. </span>When the first container was brought it was fit and designated for the offerings, whereas the coins in the second container had not yet been collected, and therefore the coins in the first container must be used first as they were sanctified first. Here, however, the scapegoat is consecrated only when its pair is sacrificed, and therefore the two cases are dissimilar.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the principle that one uses the first item is derived from the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosei with regard to the Paschal offering, as it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who separated </span>a sheep for <span class="gemarra-regular">his Paschal offering and </span>the sheep <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lost</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he separated another </span>sheep <span class="gemarra-regular">in its stead, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward the first </span>sheep <span class="gemarra-regular">was found, and they both </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stand </span>before him, <span class="gemarra-regular">he sacrifices whichever of them he wants</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of the Rabbis. Rabbi Yosei says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva </span>is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">with the first </span>sheep. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if the second was </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">superior </span>quality <span class="gemarra-regular">to it, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brings </span>the second sheep. This proves that according to Rabbi Yosei, if there are two animals equally fit for an offering, one brings the animal that was chosen first.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The mitzva of the two Yom </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Kippur </span><span class="gemarra-regular">goats</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the goat sacrificed to God and the goat sent to Azazel that are brought as a pair, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>as follows, <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">That they will both </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be identical in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">appearance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., color, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">height, and in monetary </span><span class="gemarra-regular">value</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and their acquisition </span>must be <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., they must be purchased together. <span class="gemarra-regular">And even if they are not identical, </span>nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are valid. </span>And similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he acquired one today </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and one tomorrow, they are valid. </span>
If <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of the goats <span class="gemarra-regular">died</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if it died before </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">drew the lots, he </span>immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">takes a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">counterpart for the second, </span>since neither has yet been designated. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it died after </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">drew the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lots, he brings another pair </span>of goats <span class="gemarra-regular">and draws lots</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> over them from the start. </span>
After that lottery <span class="gemarra-regular">he utters </span>a stipulation: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the one to be sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">to God died, that </span>goat <span class="gemarra-regular">upon which the lot for God </span>was drawn in the second lottery <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand in its stead; and if </span>the one to be sent <span class="gemarra-regular">to Azazel died, that </span>goat <span class="gemarra-regular">upon which the lot for Azazel </span>was drawn <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in its stead. And the second, </span>superfluous goat, i.e., in the case where a new pair of goats was brought, <span class="gemarra-regular">should graze until it becomes unfit, </span>at which point <span class="gemarra-regular">it will be sold, and the money </span>received from <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>sale <span class="gemarra-regular">will go toward </span>the purchase of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>public <span class="gemarra-regular">gift-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering. </span>Although for individual sin-offerings in similar circumstances there is no remedy and it is left to die, that is not the case here, <span class="gemarra-regular">as a communal sin-offering </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>left <span class="gemarra-regular">to die. </span>On the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda says: </span>In this <span class="gemarra-regular">it should </span>be left to <span class="gemarra-regular">die. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood </span>of the goat sacrificed to God <span class="gemarra-regular">spilled</span> before it was sprinkled, <span class="gemarra-regular">the scapegoat </span>is left <span class="gemarra-regular">to die</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">if the scapegoat dies, the blood </span>of the goat sacrificed to God <span class="gemarra-regular">should be spilled, </span>and two other goats are brought and lots are drawn. 

Daf 62b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sages taught: </span>It states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He shall take two goats</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Leviticus 16:5). The <span class="gemarra-regular">minimum </span>number indicated by a plural term, as the word <span class="gemarra-regular">goats </span>is here, is <span class="gemarra-regular">two. </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: Two</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that the two should be identical. </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where </span>do we derive that <span class="gemarra-regular">even if the two </span>goats <span class="gemarra-regular">are not identical </span>they are nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">valid? The verses state</span> and repeat the word <span class="gemarra-regular">goat, goat </span>(Leviticus 16:9–10) <span class="gemarra-regular">to amplify</span> and indicate that the goats are valid even if they are not identical. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>is specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">because the Merciful One</span> in the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">amplified </span>and thereby indicated that the goats are valid even if they are not identical. <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>indicate that if <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One did not amplify</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, I would have said </span>the goats are <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified? From where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do we </span>derive that the goats are <span class="gemarra-regular">prevented </span>from being sacrificed if they are not identical? The principle with regard to sacrificial offerings is that if the Torah indicates a requirement only once, it is a mitzva <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, and if the Torah repeats the requirement, it is considered indispensable in order for the offering to be valid. 
The Gemara answers: It could <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that since the word <span class="gemarra-regular">two</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, two, two, is written </span>three times in the relevant passage, the repetition indicates that the goats are disqualified if they are not identical. Therefore, the Torah had to indicate that the goats are valid even if they are not identical. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And now that the Merciful One has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">amplified </span>by repeating the word <span class="gemarra-regular">goat, goat, why do I</span> need the threefold repetition of <span class="gemarra-regular">two, two, two? </span>The Gemara answers that it teaches how the mitzva should be performed <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>of the terms indicates that the goats should be identical <span class="gemarra-regular">in appearance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>indicates they should be identical <span class="gemarra-regular">in height, and one </span>indicates they should be identical <span class="gemarra-regular">in monetary value.</span>
The Gemara comments that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">lambs </span>brought by a <span class="gemarra-regular">leper</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> based upon the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He shall take two lambs” </span>(Leviticus 14:10). The <span class="gemarra-regular">minimum </span>number of <span class="gemarra-regular">lambs, </span>which is a plural term, is <span class="gemarra-regular">two.</span> If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “two”? </span>It teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that the two should be identical. </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>do we derive <span class="gemarra-regular">that even if the two</span> lambs <span class="gemarra-regular">are not identical </span>they are nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">valid? The verses</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> state: Lamb, lamb, </span>repetitively, <span class="gemarra-regular">to amplify </span>and indicate that the lambs are valid even if they are not identical. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>is specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">because the Merciful One </span>in the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">amplified </span>and thereby indicated that the lambs are valid even if they are not identical. <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t this </span>indicate that if <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One did not amplify, I would have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>the lambs are <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified? From where do we </span>derive that the lambs are <span class="gemarra-regular">prevented </span>from being sacrificed if they are not identical? The Gemara answers: It could <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mind to say </span>that since <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: </span>“This <span class="gemarra-regular">shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be </span>the law of the leper” (Leviticus 14:2), the verse indicates that every detail stated in this context is indispensable. Therefore, it was necessary for the Torah to indicate that the lambs are valid even if they are not identical. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">now that the Merciful One has amplified </span>by repeating the word <span class="gemarra-regular">lamb, lamb, why do I </span>need the phrase “this <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be”? </span>The Gemara answers: This phrase applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rest of the </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>included in the atonement ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">of the leper, </span>which are indispensable. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And we also learned similarly with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to </span>the birds used for the purification of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> leper</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The verse states that the priest should take “two <span class="gemarra-regular">birds” </span>(Leviticus 14:4), and the <span class="gemarra-regular">minimum </span>number indicated by the plural term <span class="gemarra-regular">birds </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">two. What </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: Two? </span>It indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">that the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>birds <span class="gemarra-regular">should be identical. And from where </span>do we derive <span class="gemarra-regular">that even if they are not identical </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">valid? The verses state: Bird, bir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> (Leviticus 14:5–6), repetitively, to <span class="gemarra-regular">amplify. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>is specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">because the Merciful</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> One </span>in the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">amplified </span>and thereby indicated that the birds are valid even if they are not identical. <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t this </span>indicate that if <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> amplify, </span>I would have said the birds are <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified? From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where do we </span>derive that the birds are <span class="gemarra-regular">prevented </span>from being used if they are not identical? The Gemara answers: It could <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that since <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written: </span>“This <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be </span>the law of the leper,” the verse indicates that every detail stated in this context is indispensable. Therefore, it was necessary for the Torah to indicate that the birds are valid even if they are not identical. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And now</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that the Merciful One has amplified </span>by repeating the word <span class="gemarra-regular">bird, why do I </span>need the phrase “this <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”? </span>The Gemara answers: This phrase applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to the rest of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>included in the atonement ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the leper, </span>which are indispensable. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>this line of reasoning should be applied to the <span class="gemarra-regular">daily offerings</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as well. Let us say </span>that when the verse states: “Two <span class="gemarra-regular">lambs </span>of the first year, day by day, continually” (Exodus 29:38), the <span class="gemarra-regular">minimum </span>number indicated by the word <span class="gemarra-regular">lambs</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is two. What </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “two”? </span>It indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">that the two </span>lambs <span class="gemarra-regular">should be identical</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And from where </span>do we derive <span class="gemarra-regular">that even if the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two are not identical they are valid? The verse states</span> the word <span class="gemarra-regular">lamb, lamb </span>(Exodus 29:39), repetitively, to <span class="gemarra-regular">amplify</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Let us learn from here that in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>fulfill <span class="gemarra-regular">the mitzva </span>in the preferred manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">we also require </span>that the two lambs used for the daily offering be identical. 
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is needed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for that which was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Two </span>lambs of the first year, <span class="gemarra-regular">day by day” </span>(Exodus 29:38), indicates that the lambs must be slaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite the </span>location of the sun at that time of <span class="gemarra-regular">day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara asks: Do <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite the </span>location of the sun at that time of <span class="gemarra-regular">day, or </span>does it <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>mean to say that two lambs must be sacrificed for the <span class="gemarra-regular">obligation of </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">day? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When it states: “One lamb you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall offer in the afternoon” </span>(Numbers 28:4), <span class="gemarra-regular">the obligation </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">day is stated </span>explicitly. <span class="gemarra-regular">And how do I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">uphold </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Two </span>lambs of the first year, <span class="gemarra-regular">day </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by day”? </span>It teaches that the lambs must be slaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite the </span>location of the sun at that time of <span class="gemarra-regular">day. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>is this done in actuality? The <span class="gemarra-regular">daily offering of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">morning was slaughtered </span>in the Temple courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">northwest corner </span>of the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second ring</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> across from the sun, which rises in the east. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the daily offering <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">afternoon was slaughtered opposite </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">northeast corner </span>of the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second ring, </span>across the sun, which is located in the west in the afternoon. 
The Gemara comments: When the Torah states: “Two lambs” (Numbers 28:9) with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">additional offerings </span>brought on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the word two, which is unnecessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">certainly </span>indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">that the two should be identical</span> <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>If the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered the two Yom Kippur goats outside </span>the Temple courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">when he had not yet drawn lots </span>to determine which of <span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>is to be sacrificed to God and which is to be sent to Azazel, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> liable </span>to receive the punishment of <span class="it-text">karet</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for both of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them, </span>as they are both fit for use as an offering. If he slaughtered them <span class="gemarra-regular">after he drew lots </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">them, he is liable </span>for slaughtering the goat designated <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> God, </span>which is a sacrificial offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he is exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>slaughtering the goat designated <span class="gemarra-regular">for Azazel, </span>as it is not a sacrificial offering. 
The Gemara clarifies the meaning of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. With regard to the statement that if he slaughtered the goats <span class="gemarra-regular">when he had not yet drawn lots, he is liable </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for both of them, </span>the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">For what are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they fit? </span>Before the lots are drawn, neither goat is fit for use as an offering. The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span>He is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">since they are fit </span>to be used <span class="gemarra-regular">as the goat </span>whose sacrificial rites are <span class="gemarra-regular">performed outside. </span>These two goats are fit for use as the additional offerings of Yom Kippur, whose sacrificial rites are performed outside of the Sanctuary, in the Temple courtyard. Therefore, the goats have the status of sacrificial offerings. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">the goat </span>whose sacrificial rites are <span class="gemarra-regular">performed inside </span>the Sanctuary, i.e., the goat selected to be sacrificed as a sin-offering, for which the goats are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>valid because <span class="gemarra-regular">they lack the lottery? They are also unfit </span>to be used <span class="gemarra-regular">as the goat </span>whose rites are <span class="gemarra-regular">performed outside </span>the Sanctuary, <span class="gemarra-regular">as they lack the service of the day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The entire Yom Kippur service must be performed in the proper sequence, and several steps have to be executed before the additional offerings are sacrificed, including the sprinkling of the bull’s and goat’s blood, and the burning of the handful of incense. Since the additional offerings cannot yet be sacrificed, the goats cannot be considered fit for these offerings, and one should not be liable to receive <span class="it-text">karet</span> for slaughtering the goats outside the Temple courtyard. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda holds </span>that an offering is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">lacking time </span>if it is to be brought on <span class="gemarra-regular">that day. </span>An offering is considered lacking time, and therefore unfit, if it is supposed to be brought on a different day. However, if it is the proper day but the right moment has not yet arrived, the offering is considered valid. On the other hand, before the High Priest draws lots to determine which of the goats will be sacrificed to God and which sent to Azazel, even though it is the proper day, the goats are not yet considered valid offerings because there is a necessary action that the High Priest must take with regard to the goat itself before it can be brought as an offering. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Now that Rav Ḥisda said </span>that although the drawing of lots is external to the animals themselves, an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">lacking </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the lottery is comparable to </span>an animal <span class="gemarra-regular">lacking an action </span>and is not yet considered a valid offering, a statement can be made with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which Rav Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: Peace-offerings that one slaughtered </span>in the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">before the</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">doors of the Sanctuary were opene</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are disqualified, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated </span>with regard to peace-offerings: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he shall slaughter it at the entrance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the Tent of Meeting” </span>(Leviticus 3:2), which teaches that it must be slaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the entrance <span class="gemarra-regular">is open </span>and serves as an actual entrance, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not when it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is locked. </span>As long as the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, or in the Temple the doors to the Sanctuary, remain closed, one may not sacrifice the peace-offerings, and if they are sacrificed, they are disqualified. 

Daf 63a

Based on Rav Ḥisda’s statement, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he slaughtered </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them outside </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">before the doors of the Sanctuary </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were opene</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he is exempt. What is the reason? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lacking </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">opening </span>of the doors <span class="gemarra-regular">is comparable to lacking </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an action. </span>Therefore, the offering was not yet fit to be sacrificed in the Temple, and when he slaughtered it outside, despite doing so with the intention that it is a sacrificial offering, he is not considered to have violated the prohibition against sacrificing an offering outside the Temple. 
Rav Ḥisda stated above that since the Yom Kippur goats could be used for the additional offerings, one is liable for slaughtering them outside the Temple. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does Rav Ḥisd</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accept</span> the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sinc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> a particular situation could come to be in the future, it is viewed as though it existed already in the present? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And didn’t Rav Ḥisda say: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered a Paschal lamb outside </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">during the rest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the days of the yea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> other than Passover eve, if he slaughtered it <span class="gemarra-regular">for its own sake, </span>i.e., as a Paschal lamb, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is exempt, </span>since at that time it is not fit to be sacrificed as a Paschal lamb. If he sacrificed it <span class="gemarra-regular">not for its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">own sake </span>but rather as a peace-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">liable. </span>A Paschal lamb that is slaughtered as a peace-offering on any day of the year other than Passover eve is considered a valid peace-offering. Therefore, it has the status of an offering that is fit to be sacrificed in the Temple, and he is liable for slaughtering it outside the Temple. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>he is liable is because he specifically slaughtered it <span class="gemarra-regular">not for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its own sake. However, </span>if he slaughtered it <span class="gemarra-regular">without specifying</span> what offering he had in mind, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span>considered to have been slaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">for its own sake and he is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exempt. But why </span>is he exempt? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Since it is fit </span>to be sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">not for its own sake, </span>i.e., as a peace-offering, it should be considered as though he slaughtered it as a peace-offering outside the Temple, and he should be liable. 
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be compared? There,</span> with regard to the Paschal lamb, it <span class="gemarra-regular">requires </span>explicit <span class="gemarra-regular">uprooting</span> from the status of a Paschal lamb in order to be considered a peace-offering. Therefore, if he did not specify his intent, it is still considered a Paschal lamb, which is not fit to be sacrificed. <span class="gemarra-regular">These </span>Yom Kippur goats <span class="gemarra-regular">do not require uprooting </span>from their previous status. The Yom Kippur goats have the status of a sin-offering and the goats sacrificed as part of the additional offerings of the day are also considered sin-offerings. Therefore, one who slaughters them outside the Temple is liable, as they are fit to be sacrificed at that time as sin-offerings, even without the principle: Since, etc. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Shimi taught these </span>two <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>, cited above in the name of Rav Ḥisda, <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the name of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, and he </span>found <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty between </span>one statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span>and another statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba. And he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> resolved </span>the apparent contradiction <span class="gemarra-regular">as we resolved </span>it.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Dimi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yirmeya said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>said: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Paschal lamb outside </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">during the rest of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">days of the year, whether </span>he slaughtered it <span class="gemarra-regular">for its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">own sake, </span>as a Paschal lamb, <span class="gemarra-regular">or not for its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> own sake, </span>as a peace-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is exempt.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Dimi said: I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Rabbi Yirmeya </span>and asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>when he slaughters it outside the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">for its own</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sake </span>he is exempt, <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is not fit </span>to be brought as a Paschal lamb at that time, and one is liable for slaughtering an offering outside the Temple only if it was fit to be sacrificed in the Temple. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if he slaughters it <span class="gemarra-regular">not for its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">own sake, why </span>is he exempt? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it fit</span> to be sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">not for its own sake </span>as a peace-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the Temple? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Yirmeya <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to me </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Uprooting </span>an offering’s designation <span class="gemarra-regular">outside</span> the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">is not called uprooting. </span>Since he slaughtered it outside, the status of the offering does not change from that of a Paschal lamb to that of a peace-offering, despite his intention to this effect. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">When Ravin came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span>a different version of the statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>said: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered a Paschal lamb outside </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">during the rest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the days of the year, whether </span>he slaughtered it <span class="gemarra-regular">for its own sake or not for its own sake</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he is liable. </span>
The Gemara expresses surprise: Is he liable <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if he slaughtered it <span class="gemarra-regular">for its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">own sake? Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Zevaḥim</span> that one is exempt for sacrificing an offering that was not yet fit for sacrifice because it was <span class="gemarra-regular">lacking time</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> This is so <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">itself </span>was lacking time, such as if it was less than eight days old, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>it was lacking time <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">owners. </span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is </span>an offering that is <span class="gemarra-regular">lacking time </span><span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">owners? A </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zava</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woman after childbirth, and a leper, </span>who sacrificed their offerings before the appropriate time. A <span class="it-text">zav</span>, a <span class="it-text">zava</span>, and a leper bring their offerings after counting seven days; a woman after childbirth brings hers when her purification period is complete. 
Any of these people <span class="gemarra-regular">who sacrificed their sin-offering and, </span>in the case of lepers, <span class="gemarra-regular">their guilt-offerin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> outside </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">are exempt. </span>Since they would not fulfill their obligations to bring these offerings if they would sacrifice them in the Temple, and the offerings are unfit to be brought as voluntary offerings, because sin-offerings and guilt-offerings are not brought as voluntary offerings, one who slaughters them outside the Temple is not liable. However, if they sacrifice <span class="gemarra-regular">their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> burnt-offerings and peace-offerings outside </span>the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> liable. </span>This is because these offerings could be valid as voluntary offerings if they were sacrificed in the Temple. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥilkiya bar Tovi said: They only taught </span>that one is exempt for the guilt-offering when it is slaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its own sake, but </span>if it is slaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">not for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its own sake, he is liable, </span>because a guilt-offering slaughtered in the Temple not for its own sake is valid. 
The Gemara considers this: If he slaughtered it <span class="gemarra-regular">for its own sake, in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">any event he is exempt. Why? Let us say: Since</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they are fit </span>to be sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">inside </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for their own sake, </span>he should be liable for sacrificing them outside. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">How can </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> compared? There, </span>the guilt-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">requires </span>explicit <span class="gemarra-regular">uprooting </span>of its designation in order to be valid. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, a Paschal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lamb during the rest of the days of the year </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a peace-offering, </span>even if its status is not explicitly uprooted. 
The Gemara continues to discuss the case of a Paschal lamb that was slaughtered outside the Temple during the rest of the year, and not for its own sake. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ashi taught: He is liable, as we stated. Rav Yirmeya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Difti taught: He is exempt. </span>Rav Yirmeya <span class="gemarra-regular">held </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a Paschal lamb during the rest of the days of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the year requires uprooting </span>of its previous designation, <span class="gemarra-regular">and uprooting</span> an offering’s designation <span class="gemarra-regular">outside </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">is not called</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> uprooting. And this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disagrees with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥilkiya bar Tovi, </span>who held that uprooting an offering’s designation outside the Temple is considered an effective uprooting of that designation. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Master said: </span>If he slaughtered the two Yom Kippur goats outside the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">after he drew lots </span>to determine which of <span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>is to be sacrificed to God and which is sent to Azazel, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is liable for </span>slaughtering the one designated <span class="gemarra-regular">for God, and exempt for </span>the one designated to be sent <span class="gemarra-regular">to Azazel. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> based upon the verses: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Any man of the house of Israel who shall slaughter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a bull, or a lamb, or a goat in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">camp, or who slaughters it outside the camp, and has </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not brought it to the entrance to the Tent of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Meeting to present it as an offering to the Lord </span>before the tabernacle of the Lord, blood shall be imputed to that man; he has shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people” (Leviticus 17:3–4). 

Daf 63b

<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it would have mentioned just the word <span class="gemarra-regular">offering, I </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>that one is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>for slaughtering animals <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated for Temple maintenanc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> outside the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">which are </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">called offering, as it is stated: “And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we have brought the Lord’s offering, </span>what every man has found: Articles of gold, armlets, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and pendants” (Numbers 31:50). Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not brought it to the entrance to the Tent of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meeting” </span>(Leviticus 17:4), to teach that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">fit </span>to be sacrificed within <span class="gemarra-regular">the entrance to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Tent of Meeting </span>or the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">one is liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>slaughtering <span class="gemarra-regular">it outside </span>the Temple. Conversely, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">that is not fit </span>to be sacrificed within <span class="gemarra-regular">the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, one is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> liable for </span>slaughtering <span class="gemarra-regular">it outside </span>the Temple. 
Furthermore: <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>might <span class="gemarra-regular">exclude these </span>animals consecrated for Temple maintenance, <span class="gemarra-regular">which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not fit </span>to be sacrificed within <span class="gemarra-regular">the entrance to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Tent of Meeting </span>because they are blemished, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will not exclude the heifer of a purification offerin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">scapegoat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which are fit to come to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> states “to the Lord” </span>to indicate that one is liable only for <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">that are designated exclusively for God</span> as offerings. <span class="gemarra-regular">These, </span>the heifer of a purification offering and the scapegoat, <span class="gemarra-regular">are excluded, as they are not designated exclusively</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for God </span>as sacrificial offerings but are used for some other purpose.
The Gemara asks about this halakhic midrash: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does </span>the expression <span class="gemarra-regular">“to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Lord” </span>come <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude? </span>The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>based upon the verse: “When a bull, or a lambs, or a goat, is born it shall be seven days under its mother; but from the eighth day on <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may be accepted as an offering by fire to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lord” </span>(Leviticus 22:27). An offering by fire to the Lord: <span class="gemarra-regular">These are </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">by fire, </span>which are sacrificed on the altar and which may not be sacrificed before their proper time. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do we derive <span class="gemarra-regular">that he may not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">consecrate </span>an animal when it is <span class="gemarra-regular">lacking time</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., before the eighth day? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: An offering, </span>which indicates that it should not be designated as an offering before the eighth day. The expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">To the Lord</span> comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to include the scapegoat, </span>which is also brought for the sake of God. In other words, the expression: To the Lord, not only does not exclude the scapegoat from the category of offerings, but specifically includes it in this category. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that this can be resolved as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">There </span>the expression is understood <span class="gemarra-regular">in the context of the verse and here </span>it is understood <span class="gemarra-regular">in the context of the verse. There, </span>with regard to consecrated animals slaughtered outside the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">To the entrance, </span>in that same verse comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> include </span>other offerings, the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">To the Lord </span>necessarily comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude. </span>Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>with regard to consecrating animals before the proper time, <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the phrase: Offering <span class="gemarra-regular">by fire </span>comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude, </span>the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">To the Lord </span>comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">include. </span>
Once the contradiction has been reconciled, the Gemara challenges the reasoning of the argument. <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>the scapegoat may not be consecrated before it is eight days old <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">because the Merciful One </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">included </span>it among the other offerings. <span class="gemarra-regular">But had it not included </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: The scapegoat </span>may be <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">lacking time. </span>However, this is difficult: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>it true that <span class="gemarra-regular">the lottery establishes </span>as the goat that is sacrificed to God, <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>one that is <span class="gemarra-regular">fit </span>to be sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">to God? </span>Since it is not known in advance which goat will be designated for this purpose, both goats must be eight days old and thereby fit to be sacrificed to God. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose</span> opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Egyptian</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanan the Egyptian says: Even </span>if the goat sacrificed to God has already been slaughtered and its <span class="gemarra-regular">blood </span>has been collected <span class="gemarra-regular">in the cup, </span>if the scapegoat dies, <span class="gemarra-regular">he brings </span>another goat as <span class="gemarra-regular">a counterpart and pairs it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the goat that has already been slaughtered. Since in this case the priest need not draw new lots and the second goat is immediately designated to be sent to Azazel, it was necessary to teach that this goat must not be lacking time. 
The Gemara presents a challenge with regard to this answer. <span class="gemarra-regular">Say that you heard Ḥanan the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Egyptian </span>say <span class="gemarra-regular">that he does not </span>hold that if the scapegoat dies, the blood of the other goat is <span class="gemarra-regular">rejected. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Did you </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">hear him </span>say <span class="gemarra-regular">that he does not </span>require a new <span class="gemarra-regular">lottery </span>for the second goat? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>he meant that one <span class="gemarra-regular">brings </span>two new goats <span class="gemarra-regular">and draws lots, </span>and whichever is designated to be sent to Azazel is the counterpart to the goat that was already slaughtered. 
The Gemara presents another explanation of why it was necessary for the Torah to indicate that the scapegoat must not be lacking time. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Yosef said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this? It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, as it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If one of </span>the goats <span class="gemarra-regular">dies</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he brings another </span>goat in its place <span class="gemarra-regular">without a lottery</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Shimon. </span>Therefore, if the scapegoat would die, another goat would be designated as the scapegoat without a lottery, and it was necessary for the Torah to indicate that this goat had to be eight days old. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said </span>that it is possible to answer according to all opinions. The derivation was necessary in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the scapegoat <span class="gemarra-regular">became blemishe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> after the lottery <span class="gemarra-regular">and they redeemed it with another. </span>In that situation, all agree that the new scapegoat does not need to be designated through a lottery, because the status of the original scapegoat was transferred to its replacement. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do you say that</span> the scapegoat <span class="gemarra-regular">is disqualified </span>by a <span class="gemarra-regular">blemish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> A blemish disqualifies only a sacrificial offering, and the scapegoat is not a sacrificial offering. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> based upon the verse: “Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a growth, or scurvy, or scabbed, you shall not offer these to the Lord, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor make </span>an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">by fire of them </span>upon the altar to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:22). The phrase: Nor make an offering by fire of them; <span class="gemarra-regular">these are the fats </span>of blemished animals, which may not be sacrificed on the altar. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have only </span>derived that it is prohibited to sacrifice <span class="gemarra-regular">all</span> the fats of a blemished animal; <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>do I derive that it is prohibited to sacrifice <span class="gemarra-regular">some of them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? The verse states “of them,” </span>which indicates that the prohibition applies even to some of them. <span class="gemarra-regular">“The altar”; this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>referring to the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">sprinkling the blood </span>of blemished animals. The phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“to the Lord” </span>comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> include the scapegoat, </span>which is also disqualified by a blemish. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary to write </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a blemished </span>scapegoat is disqualified <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary to write </span>that a scapegoat may not be <span class="gemarra-regular">lacking time. Since if the Merciful </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One had written </span>only that a scapegoat is disqualified if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">lacking time, </span>one might have said that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">because its time has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come </span>and therefore it is unable to become consecrated. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a blemished </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">whose time has </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">arrived, say </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>disqualified. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">if the Merciful One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had written </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">that a blemished </span>scapegoat is disqualified, one might have said that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">abhorrent </span>to sacrifice a blemished animal as an offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">However</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with regard to a goat that is <span class="gemarra-regular">lacking time, which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not abhorrent, say </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>disqualified. It is therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>for the Torah to include the scapegoat in both disqualifications. 

Daf 64a

The Gemara presents another explanation as to why a verse is needed to indicate that the scapegoat may not be lacking time. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>It is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the one who sold the two goats <span class="gemarra-regular">had </span>a critically <span class="gemarra-regular">ill perso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his household, and he slaughtered the mother </span>of the scapegoat in order to save the ill person’s life <span class="gemarra-regular">on Yom Kippur. </span>Although the scapegoat is more than eight days old, it is considered lacking time because it is prohibited to slaughter a mother animal and its offspring on the same day. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it prohibited in a case like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this? The Merciful One stated </span>in the Torah: “And whether it be a cow or ewe, <span class="gemarra-regular">you shall not slaughter</span> it and its young on one day” (Leviticus 22:28), <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span>act of pushing the scapegoat off the cliff <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>a ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter. </span>Consequently, the prohibition against slaughtering a mother animal and its offspring should not apply. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">They say in the West, </span>i.e., Eretz Yisrael, that <span class="gemarra-regular">pushing it </span>off <span class="gemarra-regular">the cliff, </span>which is the manner in which the scapegoat is supposed to be killed, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">its slaughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
§ It was taught in the mishna that if one of the goats dies after the lottery, a second pair of goats is sought and new lots are drawn. After that lottery, the priest utters a stipulation: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the one to be sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">to God died, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>goat <span class="gemarra-regular">upon which </span>the lot for God was drawn shall stand in its stead; and if the one to be sent to Azazel died, that goat upon which the lot for Azazel was drawn shall stand in its stead. The second, superfluous goat should graze until it becomes blemished, at which point it will be sold and the money received in its sale will go to the purchase of a public gift-offering. The Gemara discusses which goat is set to pasture: The one that remains from the first lottery or the one that remains from the second lottery? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>If the goat to be sent to Azazel died, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should sacrifice the second </span>goat <span class="gemarra-regular">of the first pair </span>to God, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>goat <span class="gemarra-regular">of the second pair should graze </span>until it becomes unfit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The second </span>goat <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first pair </span>is the one that <span class="gemarra-regular">should graze, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">should sacrifice the second </span>goat <span class="gemarra-regular">of the second pair. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disagree? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">animals are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not rejected</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> An animal that was consecrated as an offering but later became unfit for sacrifice is not considered disqualified forever. Therefore, although the remaining goat was not eligible to be sacrificed when its counterpart died, once another goat has been paired with it following a new lottery, it is no longer rejected and should be sacrificed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">animals are rejected. </span>Therefore, once the remaining goat from the first pair became disqualified, it remains disqualified forever. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason</span> for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">derives </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applicable to an animal that is <span class="gemarra-regular">lacking time. </span>In the case of an animal that is <span class="gemarra-regular">lacking time, is it not </span>true that <span class="gemarra-regular">although it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is unfit now, when it again becomes fit, it seems </span><span class="gemarra-regular">well, </span>i.e., it may be sacrificed as an offering? <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, too, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">no different. </span>The Gemara rejects this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it comparable? There, </span>when the animal is lacking time, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was never fit </span>to be sacrificed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">was fit </span>as an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>later became unfit and <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">rejected. </span>Perhaps in this case it is permanently disqualified.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Gemara retracts the first explanation and says that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the reasoning of Rav: He derives </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal with a temporary blemish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The animal is disqualified as an offering as long as the blemish remains, but is eligible for sacrifice once the blemish has healed. In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with a temporary blemish, is it not </span>true that <span class="gemarra-regular">although </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is unfit now, when it again becomes fit, it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seems well, </span>i.e., it may be sacrificed as an offering? <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">no different. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of an animal with a temporary blemish, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where do we </span>derive this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written: “Because their corruption is in them, there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a blemish in them; </span>they shall not be accepted for you” (Leviticus 22:25), which teaches us: It is when the <span class="gemarra-regular">blemish is in them that they shall not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be accepted; but if their blemish passes, they shall be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accepted.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>respond to this proof? <span class="gemarra-regular">The Merciful One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">limited </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> by using the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">In them, </span>which indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is they, </span>animals with temporary blemishes, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are accepted when their blemishes pass, but </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>other animals that become disqualified, <span class="gemarra-regular">once they are rejected </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>remain <span class="gemarra-regular">rejected. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>answer Rabbi Yoḥanan? <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>term: <span class="gemarra-regular">In them, </span>should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is on their own that they are not accepted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; but in mixture</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> with animals thatare fit to be sacrificed, animals that have a temporary blemish <span class="gemarra-regular">are accepted. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If limbs </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">unblemished </span>burnt-offerings became mixed <span class="gemarra-regular">with limbs</span> from <span class="gemarra-regular">blemished </span>burnt-offerings, which are disqualified, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the head of one of them is sacrificed </span>on the altar before they knew of the blemish, <span class="gemarra-regular">they should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sacrifice all the heads, </span>as it is assumed that the head of the disqualified animal was the one already sacrificed on the altar. Similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">the legs of one of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them </span>were sacrificed, <span class="gemarra-regular">they should sacrifice all the legs. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: Even if all of them were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificed except for one, </span>that one <span class="gemarra-regular">should be taken out </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to the place </span>designated for <span class="gemarra-regular">burning </span>disqualified offerings, as it is not assumed that the limbs of the disqualified animal have already been brought. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how does <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>Sage, Rabbi Yoḥanan, derive the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the limbs are acceptable if they are in a mixture? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He derives </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it from </span>the Torah’s choice of terminology: It could have written: “In them,” as <span class="gemarra-italic">bam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>but instead it used the term <span class="gemarra-italic">bahem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with the extra letter <span class="it-text">heh</span>, and therefore an extra <span class="it-text">halakha</span> can be derived from this word. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the other </span>Sage, Rav, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">expound </span>the difference in terminology between the words <span class="gemarra-italic">bam</span> and <span class="gemarra-italic">bahem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as he does not consider the distinction significant enough to teach a <span class="it-text">halakha</span>.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Rav, although living beings</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not </span>permanently <span class="gemarra-regular">rejected, </span>that only explains why the remaining goat of the first pair is acceptable for sacrifice, but why must it be the one to be sacrificed? <span class="gemarra-regular">If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he wants this </span>one from the first pair <span class="gemarra-regular">he should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sacrifice it, and if he wants that </span>one from the second pair, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should sacrifice that.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Rav holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, who said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva </span>should be fulfilled with the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">from the first </span>pair. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Which</span> statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei </span>indicates that this is his opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei</span> with <span class="gemarra-regular">regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">containers, as we learned </span>in a mishna: There were <span class="gemarra-regular">three containers, </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">of which </span>held <span class="gemarra-regular">three</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, with which they collected </span>coins from <span class="gemarra-regular">the chamber</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And </span>the letters <span class="gemarra-italic">alef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-italic">gimmel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were written</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on them. And it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said: Why were </span><span class="gemarra-italic">alef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-italic">gimmel</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">written on them? </span>In order <span class="gemarra-regular">to know which of them </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was collected </span>from the chamber <span class="gemarra-regular">first, </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to bring </span>an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">from it first, as the mitzva is </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">with the first </span>one.
That statement of Rabbi Yosei cannot serve as the source for Rav’s opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">different there, </span>in the case of the containers, <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at the time when the first </span>container of coins <span class="gemarra-regular">was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fit </span>for use, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>containers used <span class="gemarra-regular">later </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">fit </span>for use. Therefore, it cannot serve as a precedent with regard to a case in which both became fit for use at the same time. In the case of the Yom Kippur goats, none of the goats are actually fit for sacrifice until the point in the Temple service when they are supposed to be sacrificed. By that time, lots have already been drawn for the second pair of goats. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the source of Rav’s opinion is the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei with regard to the Paschal lamb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. As we learned </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who separated </span>an animal as <span class="gemarra-regular">his Paschal lamb and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it became lost, and he separated another in its stead, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward, </span>but before midday on the eve of Passover, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">is found, and they are both standing </span>before him, the owner may <span class="gemarra-regular">bring whichever of them he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wishes. </span>This is the <span class="gemarra-regular">statement of the Rabbis. Rabbi Yosei </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva</span> should be performed <span class="gemarra-regular">with the first </span>one. 

Daf 64b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if the second one was superior to it, he brings</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that one. </span>This demonstrates that according to Rabbi Yosei, when the two animals become fit for sacrifice at the same time, preference should be given to the first one unless the second one is superior. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The language of <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna is precise in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav, and </span>the language of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> is precise <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan. </span>The Gemara explains: The language of <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna </span>is precise <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav, as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: If </span>the one to be sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">to God died, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>goat <span class="gemarra-regular">upon which the lot for God </span>was drawn <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand in its stead. And the other </span>goat <span class="gemarra-regular">stands </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it stood </span>before, i.e., its status does not change, in accordance with the opinion of Rav. 
The language of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> is precise <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as it teaches: </span>When the mishna says that the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>goat is left to graze, <span class="gemarra-regular">I do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not know whether </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>goat <span class="gemarra-regular">of the first pair, or the second </span>goat <span class="gemarra-regular">of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> second pair. When </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “It shall be stood</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> alive </span>before the Lord, to make atonement over him, to send him away to Azazel into the wilderness” (Leviticus 16:10), it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>referring to the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span><span class="gemarra-regular">counterpart died. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where may it be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inferred, </span>i.e., how does the verse indicate this point? The Gemara answers that it states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“It shall be stood</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> alive,” </span>in the future tense, indicating that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>referring to the one <span class="gemarra-regular">that already stoo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> with its counterpart that died.
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood </span>of the goat sacrificed to God <span class="gemarra-regular">spilled </span>before it was sprinkled, <span class="gemarra-regular">the scapegoat </span>is left <span class="gemarra-regular">to die. </span>Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">if the scapegoat dies, the blood </span>of the goat sacrificed to God <span class="gemarra-regular">should be spilled, </span>and two other goats are brought and lots are drawn. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">animals </span>that become disqualified <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>permanently <span class="gemarra-regular">rejected, </span>even after the source of their initial disqualification is no longer present, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> scapegoat </span>is left <span class="gemarra-regular">to die. However, according to Rav, who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">animals are not </span>permanently <span class="gemarra-regular">rejected, why is the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> scapegoat </span>left <span class="gemarra-regular">to die? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to you: I did not state </span>my opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda. I stated </span>my opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rabbi Yehuda holds that disqualified animals are permanently rejected and communal sin-offerings may be left to die. The Rabbis disagree with both issues and hold that disqualified animals are not permanently disqualified, and communal sin-offerings that are disqualified are not left to die, but rather graze until they develop a blemish, and then are sold. Rav, who holds that the remaining goat from the first pair is sacrificed, states his opinion in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, i.e., that disqualified animals are not permanently rejected. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav, Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis disagree with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> regard to </span>whether disqualified animals are permanently rejected. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>who holds that even according to the Rabbis the remaining goat of the first pair is left to graze, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? Rava said: Didn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t we say </span>that the language of <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> precise in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav, </span>and it is difficult to explain the mishna’s language in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">that a communal sin-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span>left <span class="gemarra-regular">to die. This </span>indicates that the sin-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">of an individual </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a case like this </span>is left <span class="gemarra-regular">to die. Granted, according to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan, </span>who holds that the remaining goat from the first pair is left to graze until it develops a blemish, it can be explained that the sin-offering of an individual in a comparable case is killed, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with</span> the opinion that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba </span>said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said. As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Abba said that Rav said: </span>

Daf 65a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Everyone concedes that </span>if the animal one designated as a sin-offering became lost, and he designated another animal in its stead and then found the first animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he gained atonement through </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was not lost, </span>i.e., the second one, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one that was lost </span>is left <span class="gemarra-regular">to die. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav, </span>who rules that the remaining goat from the first pair is the one that is sacrificed, that goat was never disqualified, and the extra goat from the second pair was designated to serve the same purpose as the remaining goat. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is like </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">designates two sin-offerings as a guarantee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that if he loses one of them he will still be able to bring the other one. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Oshaya said </span>that all agree that if <span class="gemarra-regular">one separated two sin-offerings </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as a guarantee, he gains atonement through one of them, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the second </span>is left <span class="gemarra-regular">to graze </span>until it becomes unfit. Consequently, even the sin-offering of an individual is not left to die in this case. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the mitzva </span>should be performed <span class="gemarra-regular">with the first</span> animal, when one designates the second animal, it is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">from the beginning to be comparable to </span>an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">separated</span> in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to be lost. </span>In that case, if it is the sin-offering of an individual, the second animal is left to die.
<span class="gemarra-regular">We</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learned </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: It should</span> be left to <span class="gemarra-regular">die. Granted, according to </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>goat <span class="gemarra-regular">of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first pair should </span>be left to <span class="gemarra-regular">graze, according to Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda, </span>who said <span class="gemarra-regular">it should </span>be left <span class="gemarra-regular">to die, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>nonetheless <span class="gemarra-regular">gains atonement with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>goat <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">second pair. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to Rav, who said </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>goat <span class="gemarra-regular">of the second pair should </span>be left to <span class="gemarra-regular">graze, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Yehuda it should </span>be left to <span class="gemarra-regular">die, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Rabbi Yehuda </span>he cannot sacrifice either of the two goats: The first goat may not be sacrificed because Rabbi Yehuda holds that disqualified animals are permanently rejected, and the second goat must be left to die. <span class="gemarra-regular">With which </span>goat <span class="gemarra-regular">will he gain atonement? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you maintain </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda was referring to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>goat <span class="gemarra-regular">of the second pair </span>when he said it should be left to die? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda was referring to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>goat <span class="gemarra-regular">of the first pair. </span>The second goat of the second pair is sacrificed. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are those who raised this objection</span> from the statement of Rabbi Yehuda in the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood </span>of the goat sacrificed to God <span class="gemarra-regular">spilled </span>before it was sprinkled, <span class="gemarra-regular">the scapegoat</span> is left <span class="gemarra-regular">to die. </span>Similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">the scapegoat dies, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blood </span>of the goat sacrificed to God <span class="gemarra-regular">should be spilled</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and two other goats are brought and lots are drawn. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to Rav, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree with regard to a communal sin-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>According to the Rabbis the second animal is left to graze, whereas according to Rabbi Yehuda it is left to die. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause they disagree with regard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">animals </span>that become disqualified as offerings are permanently rejected. According to the Rabbis they are not rejected and therefore the first goat is sacrificed, whereas Rabbi Yehuda holds that they are rejected and therefore the first goat is left to die and the second goat is sacrificed. <span class="gemarra-regular">However</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, what </span>does the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in the mishna indicate? Even the Rabbis agree that the remaining goat from the first pair is permanently disqualified. The Gemara comments that indeed, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood </span>of the goat sacrificed to God <span class="gemarra-regular">spilled </span>before it was sprinkled, <span class="gemarra-regular">the scapegoat should </span>be left to <span class="gemarra-regular">die. </span>Similarly, if the scapegoat dies, the blood of the goat sacrificed to God should be spilled. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the blood </span>of the goat sacrificed to God <span class="gemarra-regular">spilled</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the scapegoat should </span>be left to <span class="gemarra-regular">die, as the mitzva</span> of the blood <span class="gemarra-regular">has not yet been performed, </span>as it was not sprinkled in the prescribed manner. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the scapegoat dies, why </span><span class="gemarra-regular">should the blood </span>of the goat sacrificed to God <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">spilled? The mitzva of </span>the scapegoat <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">been performed. </span>The only essential detail with regard to the scapegoat is the lottery, which has already been performed by the priest. Sending it to Azazel and pushing it off a cliff are carried out by an appointed person and while they are prescribed <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, they are not indispensable. After the fact, if the goat dies in some other way, the obligation has been fulfilled. 
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of the house of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yannai said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: </span>“But the goat, on which the lot fell for Azazel, <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be stood alive</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before the Lord, to make atonement </span>over him, to send him away to Azazel into the wilderness” (Leviticus 16:10). <span class="gemarra-regular">Until</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when must </span>the scapegoat <span class="gemarra-regular">be alive? Until the blood of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its counterpart is sprinkled, </span>and if it dies before, the blood is disqualified. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">We </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>(<span class="it-text">Shekalim</span> 2:1): If <span class="gemarra-regular">residents of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a city sent their shekels </span>to the Temple with a messenger, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the shekels <span class="gemarra-regular">were stolen or were lost </span>along the way; <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">funds were </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">collected</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the coins for the new year’s offerings were taken from the chamber before the money was stolen, the messengers <span class="gemarra-regular">take an oath to the treasurers </span>of the Temple that they did not unlawfully use the shekels, but that they were taken unbeknownst to them or by force. This is because once the necessary coins have been removed, all other coins that have been dedicated for this purpose are considered Temple property wherever they are, and their subsequent theft does not change that status. If the messengers take this oath, they are exempt from monetary liability. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the funds were <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>yet collected when these coins were stolen, the coins are still considered the property of those who dedicated them to the Temple, and therefore the messengers <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an oath to the residents of the city, and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">residents of the city donate other </span>shekels to the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">in their stead.</span>
If the shekels that were lost <span class="gemarra-regular">are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> found or the thieves returned them, both these and those</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are shekels, </span>i.e., they remain sanctified, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not count </span>toward the amount due <span class="gemarra-regular">the following year. </span>The next year the members of that city must donate new shekels; they have not fulfilled the second year’s obligation by having given twice the previous year. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: They do count toward the following year. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason for </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda? Rava said: Rabbi Yehuda holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">obligations of this year are </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">brought the following year,</span> and therefore it is possible to fulfill one’s obligation for the next year by using the shekels of this year. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye raised an objection to this </span>explanation. It was taught that if <span class="gemarra-regular">the bull and goat of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur were lost and one designated others in their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stead, and similarly </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the goats </span>which atone for a communal transgression of <span class="gemarra-regular">idol worship </span>by instruction of the court <span class="gemarra-regular">were lost and he designated others in their stead, </span>and the original animals were found, <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the original animals <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>be left to <span class="gemarra-regular">die, </span>and cannot be sacrificed at a later time. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon say: They should </span>be left to <span class="gemarra-regular">graze until they become unfit. </span>Then <span class="gemarra-regular">they are sold, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the money </span>received in <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>sale <span class="gemarra-regular">will go to </span>the purchase of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>public <span class="gemarra-regular">gift-offering, as a communal sin-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>left to <span class="gemarra-regular">die. </span>According to Rabbi Yehuda, if the obligations of this year may be brought the following year, the bull and goat of Yom Kippur that were lost should be sacrificed the following year, and not left to die. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>

Daf 65b

<span class="gemarra-regular">You speak of communal offerings?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Communal offerings are different, in accordance with </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tavi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>in the name of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoshiya. As Rabbi Tavi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoshiya said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “This</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is the burnt-offering for every New Moon upon its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> renewa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> throughout the months of the year” (Numbers 28:14). <span class="gemarra-regular">The Torah said: Renew and bring Me an offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the new contribution</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This indicates that communal offerings must be brought from the donations of the current year and not from the donations of the previous year. 
The Gemara challenges this solution: This works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>with regard to the Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">goat, </span>which is a communal offering and is purchased with money from the Temple treasury. However, with regard to the High Priest’s <span class="gemarra-regular">bull </span>which he pays for himself and which is considered an individual offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say? </span>The Gemara answers: There is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull due</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the goat. </span>
The Gemara expresses surprise: Is it right that <span class="gemarra-regular">due to a </span>rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>the offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>be left to <span class="gemarra-regular">di</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> instead of being left to graze? <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, this </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Tavi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>in the name of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoshiya is itself a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mitzva </span><span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, but is not indispensable. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">communal offerings that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are brought on the first of Nisan, it is a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mitzva to bring </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">from the new </span>year’s shekel contributions. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he brought </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">from the old </span>shekels that were donated during the previous year <span class="gemarra-regular">he has fulfilled</span> his obligation, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he lacked the mitzva, </span>i.e., he did not perform the procedure in the proper manner. It is difficult to argue that due to this inessential detail the Sages would issue a decree that the High Priest’s bull should be left to die.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rabbi Zeira said </span>that the reason the bull and goat of Yom Kippur are left to die is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the lottery does not establish </span>designations <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">year to another. </span>Therefore, a goat designated by the lottery one year is not eligible for use the next year. The Gemara challenges this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let us bring </span>this goat and another one <span class="gemarra-regular">and draw lots </span>again. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is a </span>rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>that was enacted <span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the lottery establishes </span>designations <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">year to another. </span>
The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">goat, </span>but with respect to the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull </span>of the High Priest, which is not chosen by lottery, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Gemara answers: There is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull due to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">goat. </span>The Gemara challenges further: Is it right that <span class="gemarra-regular">due to a </span>rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>the offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>be left to <span class="gemarra-regular">die </span>instead of being left to graze? Therefore, this answer should be rejected.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Rabbis stated </span>another solution <span class="gemarra-regular">before Abaye: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree, due to </span>a concern that the bull will become <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering whose </span><span class="gemarra-regular">owners have died, </span>since the High Priest might die during the year. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull, </span>but as for the <span class="gemarra-regular">goat, </span>which is a communal offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say? </span>The Gemara answers: There is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">goat due to the bull. </span>
The Gemara asks: Is it right that <span class="gemarra-regular">due to a </span>rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>the offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>be left to <span class="gemarra-regular">die </span>instead of being left to graze? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree due to</span> a concern that the goat will become <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whose year has passed. </span>A goat may not be brought as a sin-offering once it is more than a year old, and there is a concern that the goat will be too old by the Yom Kippur of the following year. The Gemara expresses surprise: Is this <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree? It is </span>certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering whose year </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has passed, </span>as the goat will certainly be more than a year old by the following Yom Kippur. 
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is not difficult, </span>as it is possible that the goat will not be disqualified, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to redeeming houses in a walled city the Torah states: “And if it not be redeemed within the space of <span class="gemarra-regular">a full year”</span> (Leviticus 25:30), which indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">he counts 365 days</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, in accordance with the number </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">days </span>in a <span class="gemarra-regular">solar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> year; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Rabbis say: He counts twelve months from day to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day. </span>Therefore, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, if the goat was less than eleven days old on the first Yom Kippur, it will not be disqualified on the following Yom Kippur because it will still be less than 365 days old, as long as the first year was not a leap year. Nevertheless, it is disqualified by rabbinic decree due to a concern that other goats would be used in similar circumstances even if they were more than a year old. 

Daf 66a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the year was <span class="gemarra-regular">extended </span>and made into a leap year, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is extended for </span>the benefit of <span class="gemarra-regular">the seller</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and according to the Sages he has an additional month in which to redeem his house. The Gemara asks: This works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">goat, </span>but with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull, what is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there to say? </span>The bull remains valid even if it is more than a year old. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a </span>rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">bull due</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the goat. </span>
The Gemara asks: Is it right that <span class="gemarra-regular">due to a </span>rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>the offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>be left to <span class="gemarra-regular">die </span>instead of being left to graze? <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offering </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whose year has passed </span>is not left to die but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">goes to graze. As Reish Lakish said: We consider </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering whose year has passe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as though it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stands in a cemetery</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the priest cannot take it out in order to sacrifice it because he is not permitted to become ritually defiled. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">it grazes </span>until it becomes unfit and is then sold. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The bull and goat of Yom Kippur may not be left from one year to the next by rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree due to </span>a concern that a <span class="gemarra-regular">mishap </span>may occur. As it was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> neither consecrate </span>objects, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor valuate, </span>i.e., take a vow to donate one’s value to the Temple treasury, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dedicate </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">for sacred use at this time</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> when the Temple no longer exists. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if one did consecrate, valuate, or dedicate </span>items for sacred use: If he dedicated <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> uprooted, </span>i.e., he arranges for it to die quickly. If he dedicated agricultural <span class="gemarra-regular">produce, garments, or vessels </span>made from materials that decompose, he should store them until <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">decompose. </span>And if he dedicated <span class="gemarra-regular">money or metal vessels, he</span> should redeem them and <span class="gemarra-regular">transport </span>the value of their <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the Dead Sea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> indicates that animals that cannot be sacrificed at this time must be left to die so that they are not used improperly. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>constitutes <span class="gemarra-regular">uprooting? He locks the door</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before it, and it dies on its own </span>from hunger. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What mishap </span>might occur if the bull and goat are left until the next year? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>you say it is a <span class="gemarra-regular">mishap of offering </span>the animal as a different offering, a similar concern should exist <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>animals that have been disqualified for use as offerings that one leaves to <span class="gemarra-regular">graze. If</span> it is a <span class="gemarra-regular">mishap of shearing </span>the animal’s wool <span class="gemarra-regular">and working </span>the animal, which would constitute unlawful use of consecrated property, a similar concern should exist <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>animals that have been disqualified for use as offerings that are left to <span class="gemarra-regular">graze. </span>Why are these animals in particular left to die? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the concern is for <span class="gemarra-regular">a mishap of sacrifice. And those </span>other disqualified animals that are left to graze, <span class="gemarra-regular">which are not fit for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sacrifice, he is not preoccupied with, </span>and will not accidentally sacrifice them. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>bull and goat, <span class="gemarra-regular">which are fit for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sacrifice </span>next year, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is preoccupied with </span>them. Therefore, there is a greater concern that one may sacrifice them as offerings, and they may not be left to graze. 
The Gemara comments: This issue <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, </span>i.e., whether decrees are instituted due to a concern about a possible <span class="gemarra-regular">mishap, is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. As it was taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span> <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A Paschal lamb that was not sacrificed on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> first </span><span class="it-text">Pesaḥ</span> is sold to someone who was impure on the first <span class="it-text">Pesaḥ</span> or who was distant from Jerusalem, so that it may be <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificed on the second </span><span class="it-text">Pesaḥ</span>. If it was not sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">on the second </span><span class="it-text">Pesaḥ</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sacrificed the following year. And it was taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another</span> <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If it was not sacrificed on the second <span class="it-text">Pesaḥ</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not sacrificed </span>the following year. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not that they disagree about </span>the question of whether a decree was issued prohibiting keeping the animal for an entire year due to a concern about the possibility of a <span class="gemarra-regular">mishap? </span>
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>these sources do not prove that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span><span class="it-text">’im</span> disputed this issue. It is possible <span class="gemarra-regular">that everyone agrees</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">we are not concerned about a mishap, and here</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they disagree about the dispute between Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Rabbis </span>with regard to whether it is possible that the lamb will still be fit for sacrifice the following year. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the apparent contradiction between the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> difficult. This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which says that the lamb is brought the following year, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which says that the lamb may not be sacrificed the following year, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who hold that by the following year, the lamb will certainly be more than a year old and will therefore be unfit as a Paschal offering. 
The Gemara challenges this rejection: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And, so too, money </span>that was dedicated for purchasing a Paschal lamb is subject to dispute about whether it may be kept for the following year. In the case of money, the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis is irrelevant. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, isn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>correct to <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from this that they disagree with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to </span>whether a decree is issued due to a concern about <span class="gemarra-regular">a mishap? </span>The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>that it is so.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The Yom Kippur service continues: The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">comes over to the scapegoat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, places both his hands upon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">confesses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And he would say as follows: Please, God, Your people</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the house of Israel, have sinned, and done wrong, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rebelled before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">You</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Please, God, grant atonement, please, for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the sins, and for the wrongs, and for the rebellions</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that they have sinned, and done wrong, and rebelled before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> You, Your people, the house of Israel, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written in the Torah of Moses Your servant, saying: “For</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on this day atonement shall be made for you to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cleanse you of all your sins; before the Lord you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall be purified” </span>(Leviticus 16:30). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the priests and the people standing in the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard, when they would hear the Explicit Nam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> emerging </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from the mouth of the High Priest, </span>when the High Priest did not use one of the substitute names for God, <span class="gemarra-regular">they would kneel and prostrat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">and fall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on their faces, and say: Blessed is the name of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">His glorious kingdom forever and ever. </span>After the confession over the scapegoat, the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">passed </span>the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who was to lead it </span>to the wilderness. According to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone is eligible to lead it, but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the High Priests established </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">fixed </span>custom <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">allow an Israelite to lead it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said: </span>That was not always the case. There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident where </span>a person named <span class="gemarra-regular">Arsela led </span>the goat to the wilderness, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he was an Israelite. And they made a ram</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the Babylonian </span>Jews who were in Jerusalem, <span class="gemarra-regular">who would pluck at </span>the goat’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hair</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the goat: <span class="gemarra-regular">Take </span>our sins <span class="gemarra-regular">and go, take </span>our sins <span class="gemarra-regular">and go, </span>and do not leave them with us. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> In the confession over the scapegoat, the High Priest confessed the sins of the Jewish people, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he did not say: The children of Aaron, Your sacred </span><span class="gemarra-regular">people, </span>in order to confess the sins of the priests. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>this mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya said: </span>The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is not in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, for if </span>it were <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, didn’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t </span>Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>The priests receive <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement through the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">scapegoat, </span>which indicates that their sins must be mentioned in the confession over the scapegoat? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is that to say that priests are not included among: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Your people, </span>the house of <span class="gemarra-regular">Israel? </span>Nothing can be proven from the fact that the High Priest did not list every segment of the Jewish people separately. 
It was taught in the mishna that the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">passed </span>the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who was to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lead it </span>to the wilderness. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught, </span>with regard to the verse: “And he shall send it away with an appointed man into the wilderness” (Leviticus 16:21), that the halakhic midrash interprets the word <span class="gemarra-regular">man </span>as mentioned in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to qualify a non-priest </span>for this task. The word <span class="gemarra-regular">appointed </span>indicates

Daf 66b

<span class="gemarra-regular">that he should be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">designated </span>the day before. The word <span class="gemarra-regular">appointed </span>also indicates that the scapegoat is always sent away at the appointed time, <span class="gemarra-regular">and even on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Similarly, the word <span class="gemarra-regular">appointed </span>indicates that the scapegoat is always sent away at the appointed time, <span class="gemarra-regular">and even </span>when the appointed man is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a state of ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity. </span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> stated that the word <span class="gemarra-regular">man </span>is mentioned to <span class="gemarra-regular">qualify a non-priest. </span>The Gemara expresses surprise: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that a non-priest is qualified for this service; why would one have thought otherwise? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say: </span>The term <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement is written with regard to it, </span>and atonement is achieved only through services performed by priests. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this atonement is not achieved through a sacrificial offering, and consequently the service may be performed even by an Israelite. 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> stated that the word <span class="gemarra-regular">appointed</span> indicates that the service is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">even on Shabbat. </span>The Gemara asks: With regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakh</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> is this stated? There is no apparent desecration of Shabbat by escorting the goat, since the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of Shabbat boundaries is merely Rabbinic. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: </span>It is mentioned in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> state that if </span>the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">were il</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> and could not walk the whole way, the one who escorts the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">carries it on his shoulder. </span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion was this stated? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan, as, if </span>it were in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan, didn’t </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a living </span>being <span class="gemarra-regular">carries itself? </span>Because a living being is lighter than dead weight, the living being is considered to be aiding the one carrying it, and therefore carrying a living being is not considered an act of prohibited labor according to Torah law. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan, </span>a living being that is <span class="gemarra-regular">ill </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is different. </span>Since the goat cannot walk on its own strength, despite the fact that it is alive, all agree that the one who carries it is performing a prohibited labor. 
Based on the fact that the word appointed indicates that the scapegoat is sent away even on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rafram said: That is to say</span> that the concept of <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">to Shabbat, </span>but <span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and carrying out do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">to Yom Kippur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If these <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> applied equally to Yom Kippur, and nevertheless the Torah commanded that the scapegoat be sent away, it would be unnecessary to derive that the same is true even if Yom Kippur occurs on Shabbat. 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> stated that the word <span class="gemarra-regular">appointed </span>indicates that the service is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">even in </span>a state of ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity. </span>The Gemara asks: With regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is this stated? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: </span>The verse comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to tell </span>you <span class="gemarra-regular">that if the one sending</span> the goat away <span class="gemarra-regular">became impure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">enters the</span> Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard </span>while he is <span class="gemarra-regular">impure and sends it </span>away.
§ Apropos this discussion, the Gemara mentions that the students once <span class="gemarra-regular">asked Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> If the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">became ill, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to whether the escort may <span class="gemarra-regular">carry it on his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shoulder? He said to them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> That </span>goat <span class="gemarra-regular">can carry </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me and you, </span>meaning the goat designated healthy was unlikely to become ill. Rabbi Eliezer thereby avoided the question. They asked him: If <span class="gemarra-regular">the one sending </span>the goat away <span class="gemarra-regular">became</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ill</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to whether <span class="gemarra-regular">they send it with someone else? He said to them</span> dismissively: <span class="gemarra-regular">I and you shall be in peace, </span>i.e., this would never happen. 
The students continued to question Rabbi Eliezer: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he pushed </span>the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">and it did not di</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> upon its fall, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to whether <span class="gemarra-regular">he should follow </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it down and kill it? He said to them: “So </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may all your enemies perish, Lord” </span>(Judges 5:31). In other words, the goat will certainly die on its own. Rabbi Eliezer did not wish to answer these questions, as will be explained below. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages say: </span>If the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">became ill, </span>the escort <span class="gemarra-regular">carries it on his shoulder. If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the one sending out </span>the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">became ill, he sends</span> the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">with someone else. If he pushes it and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it does not die, he follows it down and kills</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it. </span>
The Gemara cites more questions that the students asked Rabbi Eliezer, which he refused to answer. <span class="gemarra-regular">They asked </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer: What is </span>the fate of <span class="gemarra-regular">so-and-so,</span> a certain man who was known to be wicked, with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to the World-to-Come? He </span>evaded the question and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: You have only asked me </span><span class="gemarra-regular">about so-and-so, </span>and not a different individual whom you believe to be righteous? 
They asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to whether <span class="gemarra-regular">a shepherd </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may save a ewe from a lion </span>on Shabbat (<span class="it-text">Me’</span><span class="it-text">iri</span>)? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: You have only asked me </span><span class="gemarra-regular">about the ewe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> They asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">saving the shepherd from the lion </span>on Shabbat? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: You have only asked </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me about the shepherd? </span>They asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to whether <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mamze</span><span class="gemarra-italic">r</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">inherits </span>from his parents? Rabbi Eliezer responded with a question: Did you not ask me <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to whether he may <span class="gemarra-regular">perform levirate marriage? </span>They asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to whether it is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to plaster one’s house </span>after the destruction of the Temple? Rabbi Eliezer responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to plastering one’s grave? </span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was not because he was distancing them with words, </span>and made irrelevant statements because he did not know the answers to these questions. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rabbi Eliezer responded in this way <span class="gemarra-regular">because he never said anything that he did not hear</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the mouth of his teacher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since he had not learned these points from his teacher, he did not answer directly, thereby indicating that he did not have a tradition with regard to these questions.
The Gemara cites another question posed to Rabbi Eliezer. <span class="gemarra-regular">A wise woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> asked Rabbi Eliezer: Since </span>all bore <span class="gemarra-regular">equal </span>responsibility for the <span class="gemarra-regular">incident of the </span>Golden <span class="gemarra-regular">Calf, due to what </span>factor were <span class="gemarra-regular">their deaths not equal? </span>Some of the people were killed by the sword of Moses and the Levites, some were killed in a plague, and others were struck with an intestinal illness. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to her: There is no </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wisdom in a woma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> except </span>weaving <span class="gemarra-regular">with a spindle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and so it states: “And any woman who was wise</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-hearted spun with her hands” </span>(Exodus 35:25). Therefore, it is unbefitting for a woman to concern herself with such questions. 
With regard to this issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Levi </span>disagreed: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>One who <span class="gemarra-regular">sacrificed and burned </span>incense to the calf, which are idolatrous practices that incur capital punishment, was punished <span class="gemarra-regular">by the sword. </span>One who <span class="gemarra-regular">embraced and kissed </span>it, which are not forms of idolatrous worship that incur capital punishment, was subject to a divine punishment of <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>by a plague. One <span class="gemarra-regular">who rejoiced inwardly </span>but performed no act was killed <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>the intestinal illness known as <span class="gemarra-italic">hidrokan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And one </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>One who served the calf in the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses and </span>after a <span class="gemarra-regular">warning </span>was punished <span class="gemarra-regular">by the sword. </span>One who served the calf in the presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">witnesses </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span><span class="gemarra-regular">warning </span>was subject to <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>by a plague. One who served <span class="gemarra-regular">without witnesses and without warning </span>was killed <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-italic">hidrokan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: The </span>entire <span class="gemarra-regular">tribe</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Levi did not engage in idol worship, as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is stated: “Then Moses stood in the gate of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> camp, </span>and said: Who is for God, let him come to me; and all the children of Levi gathered to him” (Exodus 32:26). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina sat and related </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> with regard to the tribe of Levi. <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sons of Rav Pappa bar Abba raised an objection to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina: </span>The verse states in praise of the tribe of Levi: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Who said of his father and of his mother</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I have not seen him, </span>neither did he acknowledge his brothers, nor did he know his sons”  (Deuteronomy 33:9). This indicates that some of them did engage in idol worship and were killed by their relatives. 
Ravina answered them: <span class="gemarra-regular">“His</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> father” </span>does not refer to his actual father, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">his mother’s father, </span>who was an <span class="gemarra-regular">Israelite. </span>Similarly, the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“his brothers” </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>half-<span class="gemarra-regular">brothers from his mother, </span>who were fathered <span class="gemarra-regular">by an Israelite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. “His sons” </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">his daughter’s sons </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from an Israelite, </span>who are considered Israelites. In fact, however, no one from the tribe of Levi worshipped the calf.
§ It was taught in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">they made a ramp for </span>the goat due to the Babylonian Jews in Jerusalem. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥana said: They were not </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">Babylonians, rather they were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Alexandrians </span>from Egypt. <span class="gemarra-regular">And since </span>in Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">they hate</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Babylonians, they would call </span>all foreigners who acted inappropriately <span class="gemarra-regular">by their name </span>as an insult. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: They were not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Babylonians, rather they were Alexandrians. Rabbi Yosei, </span>whose family was from Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: May your mind be at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ease, since you have put my mind at ease. </span>
It was taught in the mishna that the Babylonians would say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Take </span>our sins <span class="gemarra-regular">and go. </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> that they would say as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does this goat remain </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">with the many sins of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the generation; </span>let him hurry and leave.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> People <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> among <span class="gemarra-regular">the prominent </span>residents <span class="gemarra-regular">of Jerusalem would escort </span>the one leading the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>they reached <span class="gemarra-regular">the first booth. </span>Booths were set up along the path to the wilderness to provide the escort a place to rest. There were <span class="gemarra-regular">ten</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> booths from Jerusalem to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cliff</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> 

Daf 67a

with a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">ninety </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ri</span><span class="gemarra-italic">s</span> between them. As there are <span class="gemarra-regular">seven and a half </span><span class="it-text">ris</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">each </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the total distance was twelve <span class="it-text">mil</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">At each</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and every booth, </span>people there <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: Here is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> food; here is water, </span>if you need it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they escort him from booth to booth, except for the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">last </span>person at the last booth, <span class="gemarra-regular">who does not reach </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the cliff with him. Rather, he stands from a distance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and observe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his actions </span>to ensure that he fulfills the mitzva properly. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">What did </span>the one designated to dispatch the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>there? <span class="gemarra-regular">He divided a strip of crimso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> into two parts, <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of the strip <span class="gemarra-regular">tied to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the rock, and half of it tied between the two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">horns </span>of the goat. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he pushed the goat backward, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and it rolls and descends</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And it would not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reach halfway </span>down <span class="gemarra-regular">the mountain until it was </span>torn <span class="gemarra-regular">limb </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">limb. </span>The one designated to dispatch the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">came</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and sat under the </span>roofing of <span class="gemarra-regular">last booth until it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> grows dark </span>and only then went home. <span class="gemarra-regular">And from what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> point are the garments </span>of the man <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered impure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is stated that he is impure and his clothes requires immersion? <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the moment <span class="gemarra-regular">he emerges outside the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wall of Jerusalem. Rabbi Shimon says: </span>His clothes are rendered impure only <span class="gemarra-regular">from the moment that he pushes </span>the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">from the cliff</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: There</span> were <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span><span class="gemarra-regular">booths</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the distance between Jerusalem and the cliff was <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>There were <span class="gemarra-regular">nine booths </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the distance was <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rabbi Yosei says: </span>There were <span class="gemarra-regular">five booths and </span>the distance was <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all of them </span>were able to escort the one leading the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>establishing <span class="gemarra-regular">a joining </span>of boundaries [<span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="it-text">teḥumin</span>] before Yom Kippur, allowing those at each booth to walk to the next booth.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said: Elazar my</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son told me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If </span>they were able to walk to the next booth <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>establishing <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, I could</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even make two booths </span>suffice for the distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">ten</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">mil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>With the proper placement of an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span>, an individual is permitted to walk a distance of two <span class="it-text">mil</span>, which is four thousand cubits. Consequently, the people of Jerusalem could escort the one leading the goat a distance of two <span class="it-text">mil</span>, and the people of the first booth could walk two <span class="it-text">mil</span> from the booth toward Jerusalem to meet him, and escort him back to their booth. Others at that booth, who had established their <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> in the direction of the second booth, could then escort the one leading the goat two <span class="it-text">mil</span> toward the second booth, where he would be met by people from the second booth, who would escort him the remaining two <span class="it-text">mil</span> to the booth. This booth would be located only two <span class="it-text">mil</span> from the cliff. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion is <span class="gemarra-regular">that which was taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: People from all the booths would escort the one leading the goat, <span class="gemarra-regular">except </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for the last </span>person in the last booth, <span class="gemarra-regular">who did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not reach the cliff with him; rather, he stands from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a distance and observes his actions? In accordance with whose</span> opinion is this statement? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>as he holds that the last booth was too far from the cliff for the people there to escort the one leading the goat the entire way. 
It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">At each and every booth </span>people there <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: Here is food; here is water, </span>if you need it. It was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: No man </span>who escorted the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">ever needed this </span>food and water. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>they would offer it to him anyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">because one who has</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bread in his baske</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not similar to one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who does not have bread in his basket. </span>One who does not have food available to him is concerned that he will not be able to find any if he really needs it, and he therefore feels his hunger and thirst more acutely. 
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">What did </span>the person designated to dispatch the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>there? <span class="gemarra-regular">He divided a strip of crimson </span>into two parts, half of the strip tied to the rock, and half of it tied between the two horns of the goat. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him tie the whole </span>strip <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the rock. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since it is a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva </span>to push <span class="gemarra-regular">the goat </span>from the cliff. If he tied the whole strip to the rock, <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps it would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">turn white quickly, and his mind would be eased </span>with the knowledge that the sins of the Jewish people had been forgiven. He would then not fulfill the mitzva of pushing the goat off the cliff. He therefore tied part of it between the horns of the goat and looked to see if it became white. Once he was actively involved with the goat, he would remember to push it off the cliff.
The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him tie </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the whole </span>strip <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>the goat’s <span class="gemarra-regular">horns. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sometimes the goat turns its head and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not know </span>if the strip turns white or not. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: At first they would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tie </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">strip of crimson to the opening of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Entrance Hall </span>of the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">on the outside. </span>If the strip <span class="gemarra-regular">turned white they would rejoice, </span>as this indicated that their sins had been atoned for. If <span class="gemarra-regular">it did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not turn white they would be sad and ashamed. </span>When the Sages saw that people were overly distressed on Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">they established that they should tie </span>the strip of crimson <span class="gemarra-regular">to the opening of the Entrance Hall on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inside, </span>since only a few could actually go in to see it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">would still peek and see: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">it turned white, they would rejoice, </span>and if <span class="gemarra-regular">it did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not turn white they would be sad. </span>Therefore, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">established that they should tie half of </span>the strip <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the rock and half of it between </span>the goat’s <span class="gemarra-regular">horns, </span>so that the people would not know what happened to the strip until after the conclusion of Yom Kippur. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Naḥum bar Pappa said in the name of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar HaKappar: At first they would tie the strip of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> crimson to the opening of the Entrance Hall </span>of the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">on the inside, and when the goat reached the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wilderness, </span>the strip of crimson <span class="gemarra-regular">would turn white, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they knew that the mitzva was fulfilled. </span>The verse alludes to the use of the strip of crimson, as it <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated: “Though your sins be as scarlet, they will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> become white as snow; </span>though they be red like crimson, they will be as wool” (Isaiah 1:18). This verse indicates that when something scarlet turns white, it is a sign of atonement and forgiveness for the sins of the Jewish people. 
§ It was taught in the mishna that the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">would not reach </span><span class="gemarra-regular">halfway </span>down <span class="gemarra-regular">the mountain </span>before it was torn limb from limb. <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">those limbs? </span>Is it permitted to derive <span class="gemarra-regular">pleasure </span>from them? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel </span>disagreed with regard to this issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">One said they are permitted </span>for benefit, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one said they are prohibited. </span>
The Gemara explains their reasoning: <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who said they are permitted </span>for benefit

Daf 67b

established his opinion based on a verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>“And the goat shall bear upon it all their iniquities to a land which is cut off; and he shall let go the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">in the wilderness” </span>(Leviticus 16:22). The concluding phrase, “in the wilderness,” is unnecessary, and indicates that the goat shall be available for anyone to use, similar to a wilderness. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited </span>based his opinion on the same verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written, “cut off” [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gezeira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>which indicates a prohibition. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, what does he do </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>term <span class="gemarra-regular">wilderness, </span>i.e., what does he derive from it? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He needs it for that which was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: There are three expressions used to describe the location of the procedure with the scapegoat: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Into the wilderness” </span>(Leviticus 16:10), <span class="gemarra-regular">“into the wilderness” </span>(Leviticus 16:21), and <span class="gemarra-regular">“in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the wilderness</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> (Leviticus 16:22), <span class="gemarra-regular">to include Nov and Givo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">Shiloh, </span>when the Tabernacle was located there, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the eternal Temple. </span>The mitzva of the scapegoat applied during the time periods when communal offerings were sacrificed in any of these locations. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the other, what does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he do with this </span>word <span class="gemarra-italic">gezeira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> needs it for that which was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the word <span class="gemarra-italic">gezeira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Gezeira</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>than <span class="gemarra-regular">cut. </span>That is, he must send the goat away to a place cut up by rocks standing upright and sticking out. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gezeira</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing other</span> than <span class="gemarra-regular">something that breaks apart and falls, </span>a reference to the goat, which is torn limb from limb. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>the word <span class="gemarra-italic">gezeira</span> is written <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>the procedure of the scapegoat <span class="gemarra-regular">is a meaningless act, </span>since what sanctity and atonement is achieved in sending the goat to Azazel and pushing it from the cliff? Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “I am the Lord” </span>(Leviticus 18:5), i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">I, the Lord, decreed it [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gezartiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], and you have no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> right to question it. </span>
Having clarified the reasoning of each opinion, the Gemara concludes its discussion of whether the limbs of the goat are permitted for benefit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: It is reasonable </span>to rule <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one that said </span>the limbs of the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah did not say: “And send </span>the goat” <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>cause <span class="gemarra-regular">mishap. </span>Once the man pushes the goat off the cliff, he is no longer responsible for it. Therefore, if it were prohibited to derive benefit from the goat’s remains, the mitzva itself could lead to a mishap if someone were to find the goat’s remains and make use of them. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>The word <span class="gemarra-regular">Azazel </span>indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the cliff the goat is pushed from <span class="gemarra-regular">should be rough </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and hard. </span>I <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that it may be located <span class="gemarra-regular">in a settled </span>area. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “In </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the wilderness.” And from where </span>does one derive <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the goat is pushed from <span class="gemarra-regular">a cliff? The verse states “</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gezeira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>indicating an area that is sharp, like a cliff. <span class="gemarra-regular">It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was taught in another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Azazel </span>is a reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">the hardest mountain, and so it says: “And the mighty</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eilei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of the land he took away” </span>(Ezekiel 17:13). Azazel is interpreted as <span class="it-text">azaz-el</span>, with the term <span class="it-text">el</span> connoting something rough and hard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Azazel </span>is so called because <span class="gemarra-regular">it atones for the actions of Uzza</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Azael</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> These are the names of “sons of God” who sinned with “daughters of men” (Genesis 6:2) and thereby caused the world to sin during the generation of the Flood. 
The Gemara cites another <span class="it-text">baraita</span> related to the scapegoat. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>with regard to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall do My ordinances</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and you shall keep My statutes to follow them, I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 18:4), that the phrase: My ordinances, is a reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">matters that, </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">had</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they not been written, </span>it would have been <span class="gemarra-regular">logical that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they be written. They are </span>the prohibitions against <span class="gemarra-regular">idol worship</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, prohibited sexual relations, bloodshed, theft, and blessing God, </span>a euphemism for cursing the Name of God. 
The phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">And you shall keep my statutes, </span>is a reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">matters that Satan </span>and the nations of the world <span class="gemarra-regular">challeng</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> because the reason for these mitzvot are not known. <span class="gemarra-regular">They are: </span>The prohibitions against <span class="gemarra-regular">eating pork; wearing </span>garments that are made from <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds </span>of material, i.e., wool and linen; performing the <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalitza</span> ceremony with <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yevama</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a widow who must participate in a levirate marriage or <span class="it-text">ḥalitza</span>; <span class="gemarra-regular">the purification </span>ceremony <span class="gemarra-regular">of the leper; and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">scapegoat. And lest you say these </span>have no reason and <span class="gemarra-regular">are meaningless acts, </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “I am the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lord” </span>(Leviticus 18:4), to indicate: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am the Lord, I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> decreed these </span>statutes <span class="gemarra-regular">and you have no right to doubt</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them.</span>
§ It was taught in the mishna that the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> disagreed about from <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> point the garments </span>of the man who leads the scapegoat are <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered impure. The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> garments of the one who dispatches </span>the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">are rendered</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> impure, but the garments of the one who dispatches the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dispatcher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> e.g., those who accompany him, <span class="gemarra-regular">are not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rendered impure. </span>
One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that as soon as <span class="gemarra-regular">he leaves the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wall of the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard </span>he becomes ritually impure. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “He that dispatched” </span>(Leviticus 16:26), to teach that he does not contract impurity until his journey has begun. On the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the verse had simply stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">He that dispatched, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought he does not become impure <span class="gemarra-regular">until he reaches the cliff. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And he that dispatched,” </span>with the inclusive term “and.” <span class="gemarra-regular">How is this </span>to be understood? His garments are rendered impure only <span class="gemarra-regular">when he emerged outside the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wall of Jerusalem. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says </span>that the verse states: “And he that dispatched the goat to <span class="gemarra-regular">Azazel shall wash” </span>(Leviticus 16:26), which indicates that his garments are not rendered impure <span class="gemarra-regular">until he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has reached </span>Azazel, i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">the cliff. Rabbi Shimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>His garments are rendered impure only when he pushes the goat from the cliff, as it says: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he that dispatched the goat to Azazel shall wash his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clothes” </span>(Leviticus 16:26), to indicate that <span class="gemarra-regular">he throws it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">headlong </span>and only then, once he has fulfilled the mitzva, <span class="gemarra-regular">his garments are rendered impure. </span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> After the High Priest passed the goat to the man tasked with dispatching the goat, <span class="gemarra-regular">he came next to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and the goat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that were to be burned. He tore their </span>flesh but was not required to cut it into pieces, <span class="gemarra-regular">and removed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the portions </span>of the offering consumed on the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">placed them in a large bowl [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">magis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and burned </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them on the altar. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">He interwove </span>and bound the bull and the goat together <span class="gemarra-regular">into braid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> as one mass. They were placed in that way upon two poles and carried by four people who <span class="gemarra-regular">took them out to the place </span>designated for <span class="gemarra-regular">burning</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> outside of Jerusalem. <span class="gemarra-regular">And at what point do the </span>bull and goat <span class="gemarra-regular">render </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">garments </span>of those who carried them <span class="gemarra-regular">impure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is written: “And he who burns them shall wash his garments” (Leviticus 16:28)? They render the garments impure <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the moment <span class="gemarra-regular">that they emerged outside </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the wall of the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard. Rabbi Shimon says: </span>They render the garments impure <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the moment <span class="gemarra-regular">that the fire </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has ignited in most of </span>the bull and the goat.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It was taught in the mishna that the High Priest removed the portions of the offering consumed on the altar and burned them on the altar. The Gemara expresses surprise: <span class="gemarra-regular">Would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it enter your mind </span>to say <span class="gemarra-regular">he burned them? </span>He would not burn them right away, since he had to perform other services first. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say </span>that he placed them in a large bowl in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to burn them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on the altar </span>later. 
It was taught in the mishna that the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">interwove </span>and bound the bull and the goat together <span class="gemarra-regular">into braids </span>as one mass before taking them to be burned. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>He made them <span class="gemarra-regular">like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a braid, </span>whose parts are interwoven. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He would not dissect </span>the bull and goat in the manner of the <span class="gemarra-regular">dissection of the flesh of a burnt-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering, </span>where the animal is skinned and then cut into parts. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>he would leave the <span class="gemarra-regular">skin on top of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the flesh </span>and would cut the animal into pieces without skinning it. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters</span> derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span> Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: It is stated here </span>with regard to the bull and goat, <span class="gemarra-regular">skin and flesh and dung </span>(Leviticus 16:27), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is stated below, </span>with regard to the bull sin-offerings that are burned, <span class="gemarra-regular">skin and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">flesh and dung </span>(Leviticus 4:11). 

Daf 68a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Just as below </span>it is prepared for burning <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of dissection and not by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> means of skinning, so too here </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">by means</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of dissection and not by means of skinning.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And there, </span>with regard to bull sin-offerings that are burned, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>derive that they are cut but not skinned? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: “And the skin of the bull and all its flesh, with its head and with its legs, <span class="gemarra-regular">and its innards, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its dung, </span>even the whole bull <span class="gemarra-regular">shall he carry </span>outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire” (Leviticus 4:11–12). This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that he brings it out whole. </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought <span class="gemarra-regular">that he should burn it whole. It</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is stated here: Its head and its legs, and it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is stated there, </span>with regard to burnt-offerings, <span class="gemarra-regular">head </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and legs. Just as there, </span>the burnt-offering is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of dissection, </span>as explicitly stated in the verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too here it is by means of dissection.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>so, derive the following from the same verbal analogy: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>in the case of burnt-offerings, the dissection is performed <span class="gemarra-regular">with skinning, so too here </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with skinning, </span>and he must remove the skin of the animals before burning them. The Gemara answers: Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states “and its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">innards, and its dung.” </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> derivation </span>from this phrase? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Just as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its dung is within its innards </span>and they do not remove it, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, its flesh is in its skin </span>and they do not separate the skin from the flesh.
§ It was taught in the mishna that the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> disagree about the question of <span class="gemarra-regular">at what point the </span>bull and goat <span class="gemarra-regular">render the garments </span>of those who carried them <span class="gemarra-regular">impure. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> based on the verse: “The bull of the sin-offering and the goat of the sin-offering whose blood was brought in to gain atonement in the sacred place, <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be taken outside the camp </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and they shall burn” </span>(Leviticus 16:27). 
One might wonder: <span class="gemarra-regular">Below, </span>with regard to other bull sin-offerings that are burned, <span class="gemarra-regular">you give them three camps</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning that the bulls are burned outside the Israelite camp or, in the time of the Temple, outside Jerusalem. <span class="gemarra-regular">And here you give</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one camp, </span>as they are burned as soon as they are taken out of the Temple courtyard, which is considered the camp of the Divine Presence. This seems unreasonable and is not to be accepted. <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">why is it stated: “Outside the camp”? </span>The intention is not that they leave only one camp, but rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say to you: Once it has left one camp </span>it immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">renders the garments </span>of those carrying it <span class="gemarra-regular">impure.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with regard to other bull sin-offerings that are burned, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where do we </span>derive that they are removed from all three camps? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: It is stated about the bull sin-offering of the High Priest: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Even the whole bull</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall he carry outside </span>the camp…and burn it” (Leviticus 4:12), meaning that he should take it <span class="gemarra-regular">outside of three</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> camps.</span>
Do <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that he takes it <span class="gemarra-regular">outside of three camps, or is </span>he required to take it <span class="gemarra-regular">outside of only one camp? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">When it says </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the bull </span>sin-offering brought for the sin of <span class="gemarra-regular">the community: </span>“He shall carry the bull <span class="gemarra-regular">outside the camp” </span>(Leviticus 4:21), that verse requires explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>need for <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to state </span>this, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it was already stated: “And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">burn it as he burned the first bull” </span>(Leviticus 4:21), which indicates that all the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the bull sin-offering of a High Priest apply to the bull sin-offering of the community as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states outside the camp? To give</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it a second camp, </span>i.e., to indicate that it must be removed from the Levite camp in addition to the camp of the Divine Presence. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And when</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it says: “Outside the camp” </span>(Leviticus 6:4) with regard to removal of the <span class="gemarra-regular">ash, </span>that verse also requires explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>need for <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse to state </span>this, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it was already stated </span>with regard to the bull sin-offering of a High Priest: “Even the whole bull shall he carry outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; <span class="gemarra-regular">where the ashes are poured out</span> shall it be burned” (Leviticus 4:12). Rather the repetition of the words: Outside the camp, indicates that he should <span class="gemarra-regular">give</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it a third camp, </span>so that it is burned outside of the Israelite camp as well. Consequently, it has been derived that inner sin-offerings are burned outside of the three camps, and when the Torah states: Outside the camp, with regard to the bull and goat of Yom Kippur, it teaches that as soon as they are taken outside the Temple courtyard, the garments of those carrying them are rendered impure.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does Rabbi Shimon do with </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">outside the camp, </span>as he holds that those carrying the bull and goat are rendered impure only once they leave all three camps? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He needs it for that which was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: It is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated here, </span>with regard to the bull of Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">outside the camp</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and it is stated there,</span> with regard to the red heifer, <span class="gemarra-regular">“outside the camp”</span> (Numbers 19:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as here, </span>it is burned <span class="gemarra-regular">outside three</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> camps, so too there </span>the heifer, it is burned <span class="gemarra-regular">outside</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> three camps. And just as there </span>it is burned <span class="gemarra-regular">east</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Jerusalem, </span>since the heifer must be burned “toward the front of the Tent of Meeting” (Numbers 19:4), opposite the entrance to the Temple to its east, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too here</span> the bull and goat of Yom Kippur are burned <span class="gemarra-regular">east</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Jerusalem. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the Rabbis, where do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they burn them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where are they burned? </span>

Daf 68b

<span class="gemarra-regular">North of Jerusalem, and outside of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">three camps. Rabbi Yosei says: They are burned in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">place of the ashes. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Who is </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disagrees with Rabbi Yosei </span>on this issue? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eliezer ben Ya’akov, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Where the ashes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are poured out [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shefekh</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">hadeshen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] shall it be burned” </span>(Leviticus 4:12), which means <span class="gemarra-regular">that there shall </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">be ash there</span> in that place, so that it is known as the ash heap even before this animal is burned there. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: </span>This verse indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">that its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> place should be slanted [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">meshupakh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>so that ash that is deposited there will roll downhill. Rava understood that whereas Rabbi Yosei requires that there already be ash present when the bull is burned, Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov does not. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: </span>There is no proof from here, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps they disagree </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">about whether the place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">must be slanted. </span>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov may agree there should be ash there to begin with, but he adds that the place must also be slanted. Therefore, there is no proof to support Rava’s statement.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught:</span> It states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he who burns </span>them shall wash his garments” (Leviticus 16:28), to indicate that only the <span class="gemarra-regular">garments </span>of the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who burns </span>the bull and goat of Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">are rendered impure, but not </span>the garments of the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who kindles the fire, and not </span>the garments of the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who arranges the pile </span>of wood. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who is the one who burns? It is the one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who assists at the </span>actual <span class="gemarra-regular">time of burning. </span>
One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">garments would be rendered impure even </span>after the bull and goat have <span class="gemarra-regular">become ash. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">states: Them, </span>to indicate that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>themselves, the bull and goat of Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">render garments impure, but they do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not render garments impure once they become ash</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: The bull causes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity </span>before it is burned, but once <span class="gemarra-regular">the flesh </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is burned it no longer renders garments impure. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>opinion of the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> and the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them when he turned it into </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a charred </span>mass and the form of the animal has already become distorted but has not actually become ash. According to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, it no longer causes impurity.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the High Priest: The goat has reached the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wilderness</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And how did they know </span>in the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">that the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">goat reached the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wilderness</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">They would build platforms [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dirkaot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> all along the way and people would stand on them <span class="gemarra-regular">and wave scarves [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sudarin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> to signal when the goat arrived. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">they knew that the goat reached </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the wilderness.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: </span>Why did they need these platforms? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t they </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">have a reliable indicator</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> From Jerusalem</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Beit Ḥiddudo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the edge of the wilderness, where the mitzva of dispatching the goat was performed, was a distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Since the nobles of Jerusalem <span class="gemarra-regular">walked a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mil</span> to escort the dispatcher <span class="gemarra-regular">and returned a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and waited </span>the time <span class="gemarra-regular">equivalent </span>to the time it takes to walk <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, they knew that the goat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reached the wilderness. </span>There was no need for the platforms. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: Didn’t they have a different indicator? There was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a strip of crimson tied to the entrance to the</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Sanctuary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and when </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">goat reached the wilderness </span>and the mitzva was fulfilled <span class="gemarra-regular">the strip would turn white, as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is stated: “Though your sins be as scarlet, they will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> become white as snow” </span>(Isaiah 1:18).
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Learn from this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥiddudo is located in the wilderness, and this </span>comes to <span class="gemarra-regular">teach us that Rabbi Yehuda holds that once the goat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has reached the wilderness, its mitzva is complete </span>even before it is pushed off the cliff, and there is no need to wait any longer.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The High Priest came to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the Torah. <span class="gemarra-regular">If he wished to read </span>the Torah while still dressed <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fine linen </span><span class="gemarra-regular">garments</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the priestly vestments he wore during the previous service, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">read </span>wearing them; <span class="gemarra-regular">and if not he </span>is permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">read </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in a white robe of his own, </span>which is not a priestly vestment.

The Mishna comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who sees the High </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Pries</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reading </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">does not see the bull and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> goat that are burned; and one who sees the bull</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and goat that are burned does not see the High</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Priest reading </span>the Torah. The Mishna explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that one is not permitted</span> to see both, <span class="gemarra-regular">but because there was a distant path</span> between them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">performance of both of them </span>is undertaken <span class="gemarra-regular">simultaneously.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is taught </span>in the mishna that the High Priest is permitted to read <span class="gemarra-regular">in a white robe of his own, </span>one may derive <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">reading </span>of the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">is not</span> classified as <span class="gemarra-regular">a service, </span>which would have required that he wear priestly vestments. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the mishna also <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: If he wished to read </span>the Torah while still dressed <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">fine linen garments, he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">read </span>wearing them. This is true even though they are consecrated as priestly vestments and the reading of the Torah is not a sacred service. Therefore, the Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted to derive benefit from priestly </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vestments</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., even when not engaged in performing a service, a priest may derive benefit from the priestly vestments, for example, by wearing them for his own needs. If so, this would settle a long-standing unresolved dilemma concerning this issue. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: A proof may not be adduced from here because <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps reading </span>from the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">is different, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">it is for the purpose </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">service; </span>therefore, even though it is not a true service in its own right, it is nevertheless permitted for the High Priest to continue wearing the priestly vestments.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the dilemma was raised before us: Is it permitted to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">derive benefit from priestly vestments, or is it not permitted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">derive</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> benefit from priestly vestments?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to this dilemma based on a mishna: The priests <span class="gemarra-regular">would not sleep in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred vestments </span>out of concern they might pass wind while sleeping. One may infer: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">sleep which is not </span>permitted, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may eat </span>while wearing the priestly vestments, even though eating is not a service. This should prove that it is permitted to derive personal benefit from wearing priestly vestments. The Gemara rejects this proof: A proof may not be adduced from here because <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps eating is different, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for the purpose of </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service. As it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall eat those things with which atonement was made” </span>(Exodus 29:33), which <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that the priests eat </span>the meat of the offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">and the owners </span>of those offerings thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">achieve atonement. </span>
The Gemara suggests making a different inference from that mishna cited above: One may infer that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">sleep which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>permitted, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they may walk </span>while wearing the sacred vestments even when not engaged in a service. This should prove that it is permitted to derive benefit from wearing priestly vestments. The Gemara rejects this proof: It is incorrect to make this inference since <span class="gemarra-regular">by right </span>the mishna should have stated that <span class="gemarra-regular">walking </span>in priestly vestments <span class="gemarra-regular">is also </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted. 

Daf 69a

That mishna’s teaching highlighting the prohibition to sleep in priestly vestments <span class="gemarra-regular">is needed for the latter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clause </span>of that mishna, which states: <span class="gemarra-regular">They remove </span>their priestly vestments <span class="gemarra-regular">and fold them and place them under their heads</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Since they are allowed to sleep on them, it must be emphasized that they may not sleep while wearing them. 
The Gemara considers resolving the dilemma from the latter clause: <span class="gemarra-regular">They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">remove </span>their priestly vestments <span class="gemarra-regular">and fold them and place them </span><span class="gemarra-regular">under their heads. </span>The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted to derive benefit from priestly vestments. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Do not say </span>that the mishna means they may actually place the vestments <span class="gemarra-regular">under their heads </span>as a pillow; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, say </span>that the mishna permits the vestments to be placed only <span class="gemarra-regular">next to their heads. Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Mesharshiyya said: </span>Given this understanding of that mishna, one can <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from here </span>that one who places <span class="gemarra-regular">phylacteries to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> side </span>of his head when he sleeps has done <span class="gemarra-regular">well</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>there is no concern that he will turn over in his sleep and lie upon them. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">So too, it is reasonable </span>to say <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the mishna permits the vestments to be placed only <span class="gemarra-regular">next to their heads </span>and not under their heads; <span class="gemarra-regular">as, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if it could enter your mind </span>to say that the mishna permits the vestments to be placed <span class="gemarra-regular">under their heads, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I would derive </span>that it is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact the priestly vestments contain a forbidden mixture of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">kinds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>among them <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">belt, </span>which is woven from a mixture of wool and linen. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even if </span>it is assumed <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is permitted to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> derive benefit from </span>priestly vestments, it would still be prohibited to lie upon them because by doing so the priests would be <span class="gemarra-regular">deriving benefit from </span>a garment made of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds.</span>
The Gemara elaborates on the preceding argument: If one claims that the mishna permits priests to sleep upon their vestments, <span class="gemarra-regular">it works out well according to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one who said: The belt of the High Priest </span>worn on Yom Kippur, which does not contain diverse kinds, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the same as the belt of a common priest. </span>According to this view, the common priest’s belt does not contain diverse kinds, and therefore it may be permitted for a priest to sleep upon it. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the High Priest’s belt </span>on Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">is not the same as the belt of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a common priest, </span>and that the belt of the common priest is made of diverse kinds, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to say? </span>How could the mishna possibly permit priests to sleep upon their vestments?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that with regard to the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">wearing </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">placing </span>the garment <span class="gemarra-regular">upon oneself is prohibited, but spreading them out </span>and lying upon them on <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted, </span>and as such it should be permitted for the priests to sleep upon their vestments, this is incorrect. As, <span class="gemarra-regular">wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Neither shall there come</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon you </span>a garment of diverse kinds”(Leviticus 19:19), which implies: <span class="gemarra-regular">But you are permitted to spread it beneath you</span> to lie upon. This is true according to Torah law, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the Sages said: It is prohibited to do so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, lest a fiber wrap upon his flesh, </span>which would lead to the transgression of the Torah prohibition. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that a priest could still avoid the prohibition of diverse kinds by <span class="gemarra-regular">placing a separation </span><span class="gemarra-regular">between </span>himself and the belt containing diverse kinds, <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">RabbiYehoshua ben Levi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said in the name of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the holy community in Jerusalem: Even </span>if there are <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mattresses </span>piled <span class="gemarra-regular">one atop the other and </span>a garment of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kind</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> is placed <span class="gemarra-regular">underneath them </span>all, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to sleep upon them? </span>This is because the rabbinic decree is applied equally to all cases irrespective of whether the original concern exists. Therefore, there can be no way for the priests to sleep upon the vestments without transgressing the prohibition of diverse kinds. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>must one <span class="gemarra-regular">not conclude from</span> the preceding discussion that the mishna permits the vestments to be placed only <span class="gemarra-regular">next to their heads? </span>The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from it </span>that this is indeed so. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Actually, </span>the mishna may be understood as permitting the vestments to be placed <span class="gemarra-regular">under their heads. </span>One should not object that by doing so the priests would be <span class="gemarra-regular">deriving benefit from </span>a garment made of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds</span> because <span class="gemarra-regular">priestly vestments, </span>and specifically the belt, <span class="gemarra-regular">are stiff, </span>and therefore the prohibition of diverse kinds does not apply to them. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Huna, son of Rabbi Yehoshua, said: This stiff felt [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">namta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> made of diverse kinds, that is produced <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span> the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Neresh, is permitted, </span>since a stiff object does not wrap around the body to provide warmth, and therefore the person wearing is not considered to have derived benefit from it.
Since the mishna’s intention is uncertain, it cannot provide a clear proof for the dilemma of whether it is permitted to derive benefit from priestly vestments. The Gemara therefore suggests another proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>an explicit <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerning this issue: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">priestly </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vestments, it is prohibited to go out to the country, </span>i.e., outside the Temple, while <span class="gemarra-regular">wearing them, but in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Temple it is permitted </span>for the priests to wear them, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether during the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service or not during the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">service, due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is permitted to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">derive benefit from priestly vestments</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Learn from this </span>that it is indeed permitted.
§ The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> taught that the priestly vestments may not be worn outside the Temple. The Gemara challenges this: Is it really <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted to wear priestly vestments <span class="gemarra-regular">in the country</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Wasn’t it taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, in <span class="it-text">Megillat</span> <span class="it-text">Ta’anit</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The twenty-fifth of Tevet </span>is known as <span class="gemarra-regular">the day of Mount Gerizim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which was established as a joyful day, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">eulogizing </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted. 
What occurred on that date? It was on that <span class="gemarra-regular">day that the Samaritans [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kutim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> requested the House of our Lord from Alexander the Macedonian</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in order to destroy it, and he gave it to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them, </span>i.e., he gave them permission to destroy it. People <span class="gemarra-regular">came and informed </span>the High Priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon HaTzaddik</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>of what had transpired. <span class="gemarra-regular">What did he do? He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">donned the priestly vestments and wrapped himself in the priestly </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vestments. And the nobles of the Jewish People </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him, </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">torches of fire in their hands. And all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that night, these, </span>the representatives of the Jewish people, <span class="gemarra-regular">approached </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from this side, and those, </span>the armies of Alexander and the Samaritans, <span class="gemarra-regular">approached from that side, until dawn, </span>when they finally saw one another.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When dawn arrived, </span>Alexander <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the Samaritans: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who are these </span>people coming to meet us? <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: </span>These are the <span class="gemarra-regular">Jews who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rebelled against you. When he reached Antipatris</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the sun </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shone and </span>the two camps <span class="gemarra-regular">met each other. When </span>Alexander <span class="gemarra-regular">saw Shimon HaTzaddik, he descended from his chariot and bowed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before him. </span>His escorts <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Should <span class="gemarra-regular">an important </span><span class="gemarra-regular">king such as you bow to this Jew? </span>He <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to them: </span>I do so because <span class="gemarra-regular">the image of this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> man’s fac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is victorious before me on my </span><span class="gemarra-regular">battlefields, </span>i.e., when I fight I see his image going before me as a sign of victory, and therefore I know that he has supreme sanctity. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said </span>to the representatives of the Jewish people: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why have you come? They said </span>to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> possible that </span>the Temple, the <span class="gemarra-regular">house in which we pray</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for you and for your kingdom not to be destroyed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, gentiles will </span>try to <span class="gemarra-regular">mislead you into destroying it, </span>and we would remain silent and not tell you? <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Who are these </span>people who want to destroy it? The Jews <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>They are <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Samaritans who stand before you. He said to them: </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are delivered into your hands </span>to deal with them as you please. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Immediately, they stabbed </span>the Samaritans <span class="gemarra-regular">in their heels and hung them from their horses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’ tails and continued to drag them over the thorns and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thistles until they reached Mount Gerizim. When they arrived at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Mount Gerizim, </span>where the Samaritans had their temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">plowed it over and seeded </span>the area <span class="gemarra-regular">with leeks, </span>a symbol of total destruction. This was <span class="gemarra-regular">just as they had</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sought to do to the House of our Lord. And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they made that day a festival </span>to celebrate the salvation of the Temple and the defeat of the Samaritans. 
It is apparent from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that Shimon HaTzaddik wore the priestly vestments even outside the Temple. This would seem to be in contravention of the ruling of the other <span class="it-text">baraita</span> prohibiting this. The Gemara resolves the contradiction: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>Shimon HaTzaddik did not wear a set of genuine, sanctified priestly vestments; rather, he wore garments that were <span class="gemarra-regular">fitting to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be priestly vestments </span>in that they were made of the same material and design. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that he indeed wore a set of genuine priestly vestments, but in times of great need, such as when one seeks to prevent the destruction of the Temple, it is permitted to violate the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, as indicated by the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“It is time to act for the Lord, they have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nullified your Torah” </span>(Psalms 119:126).
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The synagogue attendant takes a Torah scrol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> and gives it to the head of the synagogue, who gives it to the deputy High Priest, who gives it to the High Priest. The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">honor may be given to a student in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the presence of the teacher. </span>Although the High Priest is considered everyone’s teacher and master, honor was nevertheless extended to other individuals without fear of impugning the High Priest’s honor. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>A proof may not be adduced from here because <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire </span>process <span class="gemarra-regular">is for the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">honor of the High Priest. </span>The passing of the Torah scroll to people of increasing importance demonstrates that the High Priest is considered the most important of all those present. 
§ It was further taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The High</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Priest stands </span>and receives the scroll from the Deputy. <span class="gemarra-regular">By</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inference, </span>until that point <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>had been <span class="gemarra-regular">sitting. But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna: 

Daf 69b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Sitting in the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard is </span>permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">only for kings </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the House of David, as it is stated: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">Then King David went in and sat before the Lord”</span> (I Chronicles 17:16)? How, then, could the High Priest have been sitting? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Ḥisda said </span>in a similar context: This took place not in the Israelite courtyard, where the prohibition against sitting applies, but <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the women’s courtyard. Here, too, </span>the reading was <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the women’s courtyard, </span>where it is permitted to sit.
§ The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">And where was </span>this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Ḥisda</span> originally <span class="gemarra-regular">stated? </span>It was stated <span class="gemarra-regular">in relation to the following</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection </span>based on that <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where did they read </span>the Torah scroll in fulfillment of the mitzva of assembly, in which the Torah is publicly read on the <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> following the Sabbatical Year? It was read <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: </span>It is read <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Temple Mount, as it is stated </span>concerning the public reading performed by Ezra: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he read from it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before the wide road that was before the Gate of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Water” </span>(Nehemiah 8:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ḥisda said: </span>The courtyard referred to by the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">the women’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s courtyard. </span>
Apropos the verse in Nehemiah, the Gemara interprets an adjacent verse homiletically. It is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Ezra blessed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Lord, the great God” </span>(Nehemiah 8:6). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">“great” </span>here? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosef said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">that he ascribed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> greatness to Him by </span>enunciating God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">explicit name. Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Giddel said: </span>He established that one should say at the conclusion of every blessing: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Blessed be the Lord, God</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Israel, from eternity to eternity” </span>(I Chronicles 16:36).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rav Dimi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>Why does Rav Giddel interpret it this way? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>the meaning of “great” is <span class="gemarra-regular">that he ascribed greatness to Him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by </span>enunciating God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">explicit name? </span>Rav Dimi <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: The explicit name may not be enunciated in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the provinces, </span>i.e., outside the Temple courtyard.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is this really <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it written: “And Ezra the Scribe stood upon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">purpose... </span>and Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God” (Nehemiah 8:4-6); <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rav Giddel said: </span>“Great” in this verse means <span class="gemarra-regular">that he ascribed greatness to Him by </span>enunciating God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">explicit name. </span>Since this event took place outside the Temple (see Nehemiah 8:3), it suggests that God’s explicit name may indeed be enunciated outside the Temple. The Gemara answers: That cannot be proven from here because the permission to use God’s explicit name in that context <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a provisional edict </span>issued in exigent circumstances, since the people had uniquely come together in a prayerful commitment to God.
The Gemara recounts the event described in the verses: The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And they cried with a loud voice</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the Lord </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">God </span>(Nehemiah 9:4). <span class="gemarra-regular">What was said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rav said, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan</span> who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Woe, woe. It is this, </span>i.e., the evil inclination for idol worship, <span class="gemarra-regular">that destroyed the Temple, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> burned its Sanctuary, and murdered all the righteous ones, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> caused the Jewish people to be exiled from their land</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And it still dances among us, </span>i.e., it still affects us. <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t You gave it to us for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> solely for the purpose of </span>our <span class="gemarra-regular">receiving reward </span>for overcoming it. <span class="gemarra-regular">We do not want it, and we do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not want its reward. </span>We are prepared to forgo the potential rewards for overcoming the evil inclination as long as it departs from us. 
In response to their prayer <span class="gemarra-regular">a note fell to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them from the heavens upon which was written: Truth, </span>indicating that God accepted their request. 
The Gemara makes a parenthetical observation. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥanina said: Learn from this</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the seal of the Holy One, Blessed be He</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, is truth. </span>
In response to the indication of divine acceptance, <span class="gemarra-regular">they observed a fast for three days and three nights</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and He delivered </span>the evil inclination <span class="gemarra-regular">to them. A form</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a fiery lion cub came forth from the chamber</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Holy of Holies. </span>Zechariah <span class="gemarra-regular">the prophet said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Jewish people: This is the </span>evil <span class="gemarra-regular">inclination for idol</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> worship, as it is stated </span>in the verse that refers to this event: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he said: This is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">evil one” </span>(Zechariah 5:8). The use of the word “this” indicates that the evil inclination was perceived in a physical form. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">When </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they caught hold of it one of its hairs fell, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and it let out a shriek </span>of pain <span class="gemarra-regular">that was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">heard for four hundred parasangs. They said: What </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>to kill it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps, Heaven forfend, they will have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mercy upon him from Heaven, </span>since it cries out so much. <span class="gemarra-regular">The prophet said to them: Throw it into a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">container </span>made <span class="gemarra-regular">of lead and seal the opening with lead, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">since lead absorbs sound. As it is stated: “And he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: This is the evil one. And he cast it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> down into the midst of the measure, and he cast</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a stone of lead upon its opening” </span>(Zechariah 5:8). They followed this advice and were freed of the evil inclination for idol worship.
When they saw that the evil inclination for idol worship was delivered into their hands as they requested, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Since it is an auspicious time, let us</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pray also concerning the </span>evil <span class="gemarra-regular">inclination for sin </span>in the area of sexual relationships. <span class="gemarra-regular">They prayed, and it was </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">delivered into their hands. </span>
Zechariah the prophet <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to them: See </span>and understand <span class="gemarra-regular">that if you kill </span>this evil inclination <span class="gemarra-regular">the world will be destroyed </span>because as a result there will also no longer be any desire to procreate. They followed his warning, and instead of killing the evil inclination <span class="gemarra-regular">they imprisoned it for three days. </span>At that time, people <span class="gemarra-regular">searched for a fresh egg throughout all of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz Yisrael and could not find </span>one. Since the inclination to reproduce was quashed, the chickens stopped laying eggs. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: What </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">we do? </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">we kill it, the world</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will be destroyed. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">we pray for half, </span>i.e., that only half its power be annulled, nothing will be achieved because <span class="gemarra-regular">Heaven does not grant half </span>gifts, only whole gifts. What did they do? <span class="gemarra-regular">They gouged </span>out <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eyes, </span>effectively limiting its power, <span class="gemarra-regular">and set it free. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">was effective </span>to the extent <span class="gemarra-regular">that a person </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is no </span>longer <span class="gemarra-regular">aroused to </span>commit incest with <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>close <span class="gemarra-regular">relatives</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara returns to its discussion of the verse in Nehemiah cited above: <span class="gemarra-regular">In the West, </span>i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">they taught </span>the debate concerning the verse “the Lord, the great God” <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> follows: Rav Giddel said: “Great” </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">that he ascribed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">greatness to Him by </span>enunciating God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">explicit name. And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mattana said: </span>They reinserted the following appellations of God into their prayers: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The great, the mighty, and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">awesome God” </span>(Nehemiah 9:32). 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>interpretation that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mattana </span>said <span class="gemarra-regular">leans to, </span>i.e., is consonant with, the exposition <span class="gemarra-regular">of RabbiYehoshua ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Levi. As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Why are </span>the Sages of those generations <span class="gemarra-regular">called the members of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Great Assembly? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because they returned the crown </span>of the Holy One, Blessed be He, <span class="gemarra-regular">to its former </span>glory. How so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in his prayer: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">The great, the mighty, and the awesome</span><span class="gemarra-regular">God” </span>(Deuteronomy 10:17). <span class="gemarra-regular">Jeremiah </span>the prophet <span class="gemarra-regular">came and said: Gentiles, </span>i.e., the minions of Nebuchadnezzar, <span class="gemarra-regular">are carousing in His sanctuary; where is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> His awesomeness? </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not say awesome </span>in his prayer: “The great God, the mighty Lord of Hosts, is His name” (Jeremiah 32:18). <span class="gemarra-regular">Daniel came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Gentiles are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enslaving His children; where is His might? </span>Therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">he did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not say mighty </span>in his prayer: “The great and awesome God” (Daniel 9:4). 
The members of the Great Assembly <span class="gemarra-regular">came and said: On the contrary, this is the might </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of His might</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., this is the fullest expression of it, <span class="gemarra-regular">that He conquers His inclination </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He exercises patience toward the wicked. </span>God’s anger is flared by the gentile nations’ enslavement of His people, yet He expresses tremendous might by suppressing His anger and holding back from punishing them immediately. Therefore, it is still appropriate to refer to God as mighty. <span class="gemarra-regular">And these </span>acts also express <span class="gemarra-regular">His awesomeness: Were it not for the awesomeness of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Holy One, Blessed be He, how could one people</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the Jewish people, who are alone and hated by the gentile nations, <span class="gemarra-regular">survive among the nations? </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis, </span>i.e., Jeremiah and Daniel, <span class="gemarra-regular">how could they do this and uproot an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ordinance instituted by Moses, </span>the greatest teacher, who instituted the mention of these attributes in prayer? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: </span>They did so <span class="gemarra-regular">because they knew of the Holy One Blessed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be He, that He is truthful </span>and hates a lie. <span class="gemarra-regular">Consequently, they did not speak falsely about Him. </span>Since they did not perceive His attributes of might and awesomeness, they did not refer to them; therefore, they cannot be criticized for doing so.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reads </span>from the scroll the Torah portion beginning with the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“After the death” </span>(Leviticus 16:1), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the portion beginning with the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But on the tenth” </span>(Leviticus 23:26). Although both of these portions appear in the book of Leviticus, they are not adjacent to one another. Perforce, the High Priest skipped the sections in between the two portions. The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction: </span>It is taught in a mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Megilla</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">skip </span>sections when reading the <span class="it-text">haftara</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Prophets, but one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not skip </span>sections when reading <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is not difficult: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>in the mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Megilla</span> that teaches that one may not skip, the intention is that one should not skip if the sections are so far apart from one another that the delay caused by doing so will be <span class="gemarra-regular">of such length that the translato</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> who recites the Aramaic translation <span class="gemarra-regular">will conclude </span>his translation before the next section is reached. In that case, the community would have to remain in silence while waiting for the next section to be reached, which is considered disrespectful of the community’s honor. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of the mishna here, where it is permitted to skip, the delay caused is <span class="gemarra-regular">of such </span>short <span class="gemarra-regular">length that the translator will </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> conclude </span>his translation before the new section is reached. 
The Gemara challenges this resolution: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught concerning this </span>mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">skip</span> sections when reading <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Prophets, and one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> skip </span>sections when reading <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Torah. And how much</span> may <span class="gemarra-regular">one skip? </span>One may skip <span class="gemarra-regular">when the </span>section skipped is <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>such short <span class="gemarra-regular">length that </span>when the furling of the scroll is completed <span class="gemarra-regular">the translator will </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">not have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> concluded </span>his translation. The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> implies that the qualification for the length of the section that may be skipped applies only to reading the Prophets, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>when reading <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>skip <span class="gemarra-regular">at all. </span>The Gemara’s resolution is therefore refuted.
The Gemara offers a different resolution. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: This is not difficult. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>in the case of the mishna here, where it is permitted to skip, it is referring to when both sections <span class="gemarra-regular">pertain to a single topic, </span>and therefore the listeners will be unaware that sections were skipped. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Megilla</span>, which teaches that one may not skip, it is referring to when the two sections <span class="gemarra-regular">pertain to two </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">topics. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">skip </span>sections when reading <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Torah </span>when both sections read <span class="gemarra-regular">pertain to one topic, and in the Prophets </span>one may skip from one section to another even if they <span class="gemarra-regular">pertain to two </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">topics. </span>Both <span class="gemarra-regular">here and there, </span>one may skip only <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the section skipped is <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">such </span>short <span class="gemarra-regular">length that </span>when furling is completed <span class="gemarra-regular">the translator </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">not have concluded </span>his translation. But <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not skip from one </span>book of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Prophets to another</span> book of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Prophets </span>even if both pertain to the same topic, and even if the gap between them is short. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">among the </span>books of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Twelve Prophets </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one may skip, </span>as the twelve are considered one book for these purposes. 

Daf 70a

All this is <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that he does not skip from the end </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the book to its beginning, </span>since then it would be clear to everyone that he is skipping text. 
§ It was taught in the mishna: The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">furls the Torah scroll </span>and places it on his bosom and says: More than what I have read before you is written here. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why</span> must he say <span class="gemarra-regular">all this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> It is <span class="gemarra-regular">so as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not to cast aspersions on the Torah scroll, </span>because people might think that the portion he read by heart is not written there.
§ It was further taught in the mishna: The Torah portion beginning with the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And on the tenth,” from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the book of Numbers </span>(29:7), <span class="gemarra-regular">he reads by heart. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>does he read it by heart? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him furl </span>the scroll to that portion <span class="gemarra-regular">and read </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>from the text. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because one may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not furl a Torah scroll in public, out of respect</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the community. </span>It is inappropriate to make the community wait until they have reached the next section. 
But why not <span class="gemarra-regular">let another</span> Torah scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">be brought </span>that has previously been furled to that portion <span class="gemarra-regular">and read </span>from it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>People might mistakenly think the second scroll was brought <span class="gemarra-regular">due to a flaw </span>that was found <span class="gemarra-regular">in the first</span> one. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Reish Lakish said </span>a different reason: A second scroll should not be brought <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that doing do will cause an <span class="gemarra-regular">unnecessary blessin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> to be recited; before reading from a new scroll the High Priest would have to repeat the blessings required upon reading from the Torah. Therefore, it is preferable that he read by heart. 
The Gemara questions Rav Huna bar Yehuda’s answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are we </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">concerned </span>that people will think the first scroll had <span class="gemarra-regular">a flaw? Didn’t Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa say: </span>When <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">New Moon ofTevet, </span>which always occurs during Hanukkah, <span class="gemarra-regular">occurs</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one brings </span>and reads from <span class="gemarra-regular">three Torah</span> scrolls. <span class="gemarra-regular">One reads </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">the topic of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day, </span>i.e., the weekly portion; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>scroll the portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the New Moon; and </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>scroll a passage related to Hanukkah. It is apparent from the statement of Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa that many Torah scrolls may be used, and there is no concern that people will mistakenly think one or more had a flaw. 
The Gemara explains: When <span class="gemarra-regular">three men</span> read <span class="gemarra-regular">from three scrolls there is no </span>concern that people will think there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a flaw, </span>since people assume that it is befitting for each individual to receive his own scroll. But when <span class="gemarra-regular">one man </span>reads <span class="gemarra-regular">from two scrolls, there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a concern that people will think there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> flaw, </span>and they will not realize that this was done only to avoid forcing the community to wait while the scroll was furled. 
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">recites eight blessing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> after the reading. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that these are the eight blessings: <br>The blessing <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning the Torah </span>is recited <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">way one recites a blessing in the synagogue: </span>Who gives the Torah; <br>The three blessings: <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service, concerning</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thanksgiving, and concerning pardon of iniquity, </span>are all recited <span class="gemarra-regular">according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to their established forms </span>in the prayers; <br>The blessing <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Temple in and of itself; </span><br>The blessing <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the priests in and of themselves; </span><br>The blessing <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Jewish people in and of itself; </span><br>The blessing <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the rest of the prayer.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the blessing <span class="gemarra-regular">concerning the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rest of the prayer </span>reads: <span class="gemarra-regular">Song, supplication, petition before You </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for Your people Israel, who need to be saved. And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>adds an additional supplication and <span class="gemarra-regular">concludes </span>the blessing <span class="gemarra-regular">with: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The One Who hears prayer. And after </span>the High Priest concludes his reading, <span class="gemarra-regular">each and every </span>person present <span class="gemarra-regular">brings a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Torah scroll from his house, </span>although in fact each person had already brought one on Yom Kippur eve, <span class="gemarra-regular">and reads</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from it </span>for himself <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to show its </span>beautiful <span class="gemarra-regular">appearance to the community. </span>This is considered beautification of the mitzva.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who sees the High Priest </span>reading the Torah does not see the bull and goat that are burned, and vice versa. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not because one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not permitted </span>to see both but because there is a distance between them and they are performed simultaneously. The Gemara comments: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that this is not due to a prohibition; what possible reason could there be to prohibit this? The Gemara answers: This was taught explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you say that </span>it is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish said: One does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not pass over </span>the opportunity to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot, </span>even if it is in order to perform a different mitzva. 
The Gemara clarifies why this principle might have applied here. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what mitzva </span>is there in hearing the reading of the High Priest? It is a fulfillment of the principle expressed in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The king’s glory is in the multitude of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> people” </span>(Proverbs 14:28). Having a large assembly involved in a mitzva gives honor to God. Therefore, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us </span>that the problem with seeing both events was only a practical one.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">read </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>sacred white <span class="gemarra-regular">fine linen garments,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctified his hands and feet </span>as he did each time before removing the priestly vestments. He then <span class="gemarra-regular">removed</span> the linen garments, <span class="gemarra-regular">descended </span>to the ritual bath, <span class="gemarra-regular">and immersed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Afterward he <span class="gemarra-regular">ascended and dried himself </span>with a towel, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they brought him </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">golden garments </span>of the High Priesthood, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he dressed </span>in them <span class="gemarra-regular">and sanctified his hands </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and feet.</span>
The mishna addresses those offerings whose sacrifice has still not been mentioned. The verses in Leviticus, chapter 16, detail the special offerings of the atonement service of Yom Kippur. Of those offerings, the ram of the High Priest and the ram of the people have still not been addressed. In addition to this, the additional offerings of Yom Kippur detailed in Numbers, chapter 29, have not yet been discussed. These include seven one-year-old lambs and a bull to be brought as a burnt-offering and a goat to be brought as a sin-offering. The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">He emerged</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and offered his ram and the ram of the people</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the seven unblemished year-old lambs </span>mandated to be offered that day. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Eliezer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rabbi Akiva says: </span>Those offerings were not sacrificed at this point; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>they were sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">with the daily morning</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> offering; and the bull </span>of the Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and the goat whose </span>services <span class="gemarra-regular">are performed outside </span>of the Sanctuary, i.e., in the Temple courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">were sacrificed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with the daily afternoon offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
After sacrificing these offerings, <span class="gemarra-regular">he sanctified his hands and feet and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> removed </span>the golden garments, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he descended </span>into the ritual bath <span class="gemarra-regular">and immersed and ascended and dried himself.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">brought him the white garments </span>again, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he dressed </span>in them <span class="gemarra-regular">and sanctified his hands and feet. </span>Afterward <span class="gemarra-regular">he entered </span>the Holy of Holies <span class="gemarra-regular">to take out the </span>incense <span class="gemarra-regular">spoon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the coal pan, </span>which he had brought there earlier. <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>again <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctified his hands and feet and removed </span>the white garments <span class="gemarra-regular">and descended </span>to the ritual bath <span class="gemarra-regular">and immersed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and ascended and dried himself </span>with a towel.
<span class="gemarra-regular">They brought him </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">golden garments, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he dressed </span>in them <span class="gemarra-regular">and sanctified his hands and feet</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and entered </span>the Sanctuary <span class="gemarra-regular">to burn the afternoon incense and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to remove </span>the ashes from <span class="gemarra-regular">the lamps</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which signified the end of the day’s service. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he sanctified</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his hands and feet and removed </span>the golden garments, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he descended </span>to the ritual bath <span class="gemarra-regular">and immersed and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ascended</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and dried himself.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">They </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">brought him his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">own clothing and he dressed, </span>since the service was complete and Yom Kippur was over; and the people <span class="gemarra-regular">escort him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to his house </span>in deference to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">would make a feas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for his loved ones </span>and his friends <span class="gemarra-regular">when he emerged in peac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sanctuary.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It was taught in the mishna: Rabbi Akiva said the seven lambs were sacrificed with the daily morning offering; and the bull of the Yom Kippur burnt-offering; and the goat whose services are performed outside of the Sanctuary, i.e., in the Temple courtyard, with the daily afternoon offering. It is unclear whether the middle clause concerning the bull should be read as a continuation of the first clause, or as relating to the latter clause. The Gemara seeks to clarify this ambiguity. <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">saying? </span>Does he mean to say the seven lambs <span class="gemarra-regular">were sacrificed with the daily morning offering, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">the bull </span>of the Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offering and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the goat whose </span>services <span class="gemarra-regular">are performed outside were sacrificed with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the daily afternoon offering? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps this is what he is saying: </span>The seven lambs <span class="gemarra-regular">were sacrificed with the daily morning offering </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the bull </span>of the Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offering together with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">the goat whose </span>services <span class="gemarra-regular">are performed outside, </span>i.e., in the Temple courtyard, was sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">with the daily</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> afternoon offering.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>another dilemma: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the bull </span>of the Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offering, </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer’s</span> opinion: Since <span class="gemarra-regular">he omitted </span>mention of <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it must be clarified <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">performs </span>its sacrifice. Is it sacrificed at this point in the day, or at another time?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>another dilemma: According to <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Eliezer’s </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva’s </span>opinion, since neither of them mentioned the <span class="gemarra-regular">portions of the sin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offering </span>to be consumed on the altar, it must be clarified <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">performs their </span>service and places them on the altar.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: You will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only find it properly </span>explained either according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer as taught by the school </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, or </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Akiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>taught <span class="gemarra-regular">in the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Tosefta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Shmuel taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: He came out and offered his ram </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the ram of the people and the portions of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the sin-offering </span>to be consumed on the altar. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the bull </span>of the Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offering and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seven lambs and the goat whose </span>services <span class="gemarra-regular">are performed outside </span>were sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">with the daily afternoon offering.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is Rabbi Akiva’s </span>opinion as taught in the <span class="gemarra-italic">Tosefta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? As it was taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: The bull </span>of the Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offering and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the seven lambs were sacrificed with the daily morning offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it is stated </span>with regard to the additional offerings of other Festivals: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Besides the morning burnt-offering which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the daily burnt-offering </span>you shall sacrifice these” (Numbers 28:23), indicating that the additional offerings of the day should be sacrificed together with the daily offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">And afterward the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">service of the day, </span>which is unique to Yom Kippur, is performed. 

Daf 70b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And afterward, the goat whose </span>services <span class="gemarra-regular">are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> performed outside </span>is sacrificed, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “One goat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for a sin-offering besides the sin-offering of atonemen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and the daily burnt-offering, and its meal-offering, and their libations” (Numbers 29:11), indicating that the goat sin-offering is sacrificed after the other offerings of the day. <span class="gemarra-regular">And afterward </span>he offers <span class="gemarra-regular">his ram and the ram of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the people, and afterward </span>he places upon the altar the <span class="gemarra-regular">portions of the sin-offering </span>to be consumed on the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward he sacrifices the daily afternoon offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Eliezer? </span>The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">acts in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the order in <span class="gemarra-regular">which it is written </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">First he performs </span>the services described in <span class="gemarra-regular">Leviticus, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward he performs </span>the additional offerings mentioned in <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">book of Numbers. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>what is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva’s </span>reasoning? His <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">that as </span>the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Besides the morning </span><span class="gemarra-regular">burnt-offering which is the daily burnt-offering </span>you shall sacrifice these” (Numbers 28:23), <span class="gemarra-regular">it is apparent </span>that the sacrifice of the <span class="gemarra-regular">additional offerings </span>should be <span class="gemarra-regular">performed </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">with the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">daily morning offering.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Eliezer, what does he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do with this </span>verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Besides the sin-offering of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">atonement,” </span>which was the basis for Rabbi Akiva’s opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary for him </span>to derive from it that <span class="gemarra-regular">for what this one, </span>the goat sin-offering whose blood is sprinkled inside the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">atones, that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one, </span>the goat sin-offering of the additional offerings whose services are performed in the Temple courtyard, also <span class="gemarra-regular">atones</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ The <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> cited above, which recorded the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, also records additional versions of his view: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">name of </span>Rabbi Akiva: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>of the seven lambs <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sacrificed with the daily morning offering, and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">six</span> are sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">with the daily afternoon offering. Rabbi Elazar, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son of Rabbi Shimon, says in </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">name of </span>Rabbi Akiva: <span class="gemarra-regular">Six are sacrificed with the daily morning offering and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one with the daily afternoon offering. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the rationale of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbis, </span>i.e., Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, who divide the sacrifice of the seven lambs into two parts? <span class="gemarra-regular">Two verses are written </span>that suggest different times at which the additional offerings are sacrificed: <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>with regard to the additional offerings: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Besides the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> morning burnt-offering </span>which is the daily burnt-offering you shall sacrifice these” (Numbers 28:23), implying that the additional offerings are sacrificed in the morning. <span class="gemarra-regular">But it is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">written</span> that upon concluding the service of the day: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he shall exit and make his burnt-offerin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> and the burnt-offering of the people” (Leviticus 16:24). As the phrase: “The burnt-offering of the people,” is referring to the additional offerings, this verse implies that the additional offerings are sacrificed in the afternoon. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, </span>in order to fulfill both verses, <span class="gemarra-regular">he performs </span>the sacrifice of <span class="gemarra-regular">some of them </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the morning, <span class="gemarra-regular">and some of them there, </span>in the afternoon. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do </span>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? Rabbi Yehuda holds</span> that the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">performs </span>the sacrifice of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>lamb in the morning, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “Besides the morning burnt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-offering,” and then he performs the service</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the day </span>before he proceeds to sacrifice the other six lambs. Initially, only the minimum possible number of lambs is sacrificed <span class="gemarra-regular">lest the High Priest become weak </span>by doing more. He might then be unable to complete the service of the day, which cannot be performed by anyone else and without which atonement cannot be achieved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Elazar, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rabbi Shimon, holds: Since he has begun </span>to sacrifice the lambs <span class="gemarra-regular">he performs </span>the sacrifice of <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>of them, leaving over only one until the afternoon. He sacrifices the maximum possible number of lambs now <span class="gemarra-regular">lest he be negligen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> later and fail to sacrifice so many at the close of the day. There is no concern that by doing so he might become weak and be unable to perform the service of the day, because <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the service of the day, </span>the High Priest is <span class="gemarra-regular">diligent </span>and will always muster the energy needed.
The Gemara notes: Despite their disagreements, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone </span>agrees, <span class="gemarra-regular">however, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one ram </span>for the people. <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion is this? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>Only one ram for the people is sacrificed, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the one stated here </span>in Leviticus: “With this shall Aaron come into the Sanctuary: With a young bull for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 16:3), <span class="gemarra-regular">is the same one </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">stated in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Book of Numbers: </span>“And you shall sacrifice a burnt-offering to the Lord of pleasing odor: One young bull, one ram, seven unblemished year-old lambs shall be unto you” (Numbers 29:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: There are two rams </span>for the people: <span class="gemarra-regular">One that is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated here </span>in Leviticus, which is part of the service of the day, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one stated in the Book of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Numbers, </span>which is part of the day’s additional offerings. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">What is the rationale of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi? <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written: “One,” </span>implying one ram, not two. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, what </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">“one”? </span>“One” indicates that the ram used should be the <span class="gemarra-regular">unique one, </span>i.e., the best, <span class="gemarra-regular">of its flock. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>from where does <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi derive the requirement that the ram be of the best stock? <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">derives it from </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Your choice vows” </span>(Deuteronomy 12:11), which teaches that all offerings must be from the choicest animals. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, </span>why is this additional verse necessary? <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>verse refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">obligatory </span>offerings, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">free-will </span>offerings. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">are necessary </span>because the requirement in one case cannot be learned from the other. It is reasonable that a free-will offering must be from the choicest animal since it is a voluntary gift; and it is also reasonable that an obligatory offering should be the choicest, since an obligation must be fulfilled in the finest possible way.
§ It was taught in the mishna: The High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctified his hands and feet </span>and entered the Holy of Holies to take out the incense spoon and the coal pan. The Gemara cites a related <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sages taught: </span>The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Aaron shall come into</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Tent of Meeting” </span>(Leviticus 16:23), which is taken to mean that he enters the Holy of Holies. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he come? </span>He comes in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to take out the</span> incense <span class="gemarra-regular">spoon and the coal pan</span>

Daf 71a

<span class="gemarra-regular">as the whole portion </span>of the service of the day detailed in Leviticus <span class="gemarra-regular">is written in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this order</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the service must be performed in that order, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for this verse, </span>which is stated out of order and is performed only later. The verse detailing his reentry (Leviticus 16:23) is written before the verse detailing the sacrifice of the rams (Leviticus 16:24), but in fact the reentry occurs only after the sacrifice of the rams.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>to assume this verse is written out of order? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: They learned </span>as a tradition that the High Priest performs <span class="gemarra-regular">five immersions and ten </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sanctification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of his hands and feet when he changes clothing <span class="gemarra-regular">on that day. </span>Each time the High Priest changes between the white and golden garments, he sanctifies his hands and feet, immerses, dresses in the new set of garments and then once again sanctifies his hands and feet. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that the verses, including this one, are <span class="gemarra-regular">written in order, you find </span><span class="gemarra-regular">only three immersions and six sanctifications. </span>Read in order, the verses indicate only three changes of garments, which involve three immersions and six sanctifications. In order to arrive at the requisite numbers of five immersions and ten sanctifications one must assume that the High Priest’s reentry into the Holy of Holies takes place at a later time, after he has already changed into the golden garments. This would require him to change into the white garments and then back into the golden garments, providing an additional two immersions and four sanctifications. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira strongly </span><span class="gemarra-regular">objects to this: But perhaps </span>the order of the verses in Leviticus can be maintained, and the requisite number of immersions and sanctifications still achieved, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he interrupts </span>the service performed in the white garments <span class="gemarra-regular">with the goat </span>whose services <span class="gemarra-regular">are performed outside </span>of the Sanctuary, i.e., in the Temple courtyard, and are performed in the golden garments. The sacrifice of the goat is not mentioned in Leviticus but only in Numbers. Therefore, it could be inserted into the service of the day without compromising the order of the verses in Leviticus. The change into the golden garments and then back into the white garments would contribute an additional two immersions and four sanctifications, thus arriving at the requisite numbers.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>It is clear that the verse detailing the reentry must be out of order, since <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he shall exit and make his burnt-offering </span>and the burnt-offering of the people” (Leviticus 16:24). This is the first exit stated in the verses and implies that immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">following </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">first exit </span>from the Holy of Holies, <span class="gemarra-regular">he performs </span>the sacrifice of <span class="gemarra-regular">his ram and the ram </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the people </span>without any other interruption. If so, the reentry must occur only afterward.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>a different proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: </span>“And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting <span class="gemarra-regular">and he shall remove the linen garment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> which he wore when he went into the Sanctuary” (Leviticus 16:23). Now, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse does not </span>need to <span class="gemarra-regular">state “which</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he wore,” </span>as this is obvious; <span class="gemarra-regular">can </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">remove </span>anything other <span class="gemarra-regular">than what he is wearing? Rather, what </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states “which he wore”? </span>It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>garments <span class="gemarra-regular">which he had already worn </span>previously, removed, and then worn again. It is therefore apparent that this verse occurs at a point when he had already changed out of the white garments and into the golden garments. Perforce, then, it must be out of order.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Sheila strongly objects to this: Say</span> that the order of the verses can be maintained, and the requisite number of immersions and sanctifications achieved, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> interrupts </span>the services performed in the white garments <span class="gemarra-regular">with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> goat </span>whose services <span class="gemarra-regular">are performed outside </span>and are performed in the golden garments. This would provide the additional two immersions and four sanctifications required. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it written: “And he shall exit and make his burnt-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering </span>and the burnt-offering of the people” (Leviticus 16:24), which implies that immediately following his first exit he performs the sacrifice of his ram and the ram of the people and the reentry to the Holy of Holies occurs only later.
The Gemara questions the premise of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">entire passage </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">written in order? But </span>among <span class="gemarra-regular">the verses </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And he shall burn the fat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the sin-offering upon the altar”</span>(Leviticus 16:25), <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> then </span>in a later verse it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the bull of the sin-offering, and the goat of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the sin-offering, </span>whose blood was brought to make atonement in the Sanctuary, shall be carried outside the camp; and they shall burn...” (Leviticus 16:27). <span class="gemarra-regular">Yet we learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who sees the High Priest reading </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">does not see the bull and goat that are burned,</span> which are referred to in verse 27, <span class="gemarra-regular">while </span>according to all opinions concerning the order of the day, <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> portions of the sin-offering </span>to be consumed on the altar, which are mentioned in verse 25, <span class="gemarra-regular">are burned </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward. </span>Therefore, it is apparent that these verses are also not in order.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that the intent of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is that the verses are not in order <span class="gemarra-regular">except for this verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and onward. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what did you see that you </span>preferred to<span class="gemarra-regular">rearrange </span>the order of <span class="gemarra-regular">the verses? </span>Instead, rearrange the order in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>It is clear that the verse detailing the burning of the remains of the bull is out of order, since <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the one who sends </span>the goat to Azazel” (Leviticus 16:26), and then states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the one who burns </span>them” (Leviticus 16:28). The repeated use of the phrase “And the one who…” indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sends </span>the goat to Azazel does so <span class="gemarra-regular">earlier, </span>before the portions of the sin-offering are placed on the altar to be consumed, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who burns </span>the remains of the bull and goat does so <span class="gemarra-regular">earlier, </span>even though the verse detailing this burning is written after the verse detailing the burning of the portions of the sin-offering.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the contrary, </span>one could make the opposite claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who burns </span>the remains of the bull and goat does so <span class="gemarra-regular">now, so too, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who sends </span>the goat to Azazel does so only <span class="gemarra-regular">now</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>after the other sacrifices. 
The Gemara explains a difficulty with this: The phrasing of: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the one who sends”</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> implies that it was </span>performed <span class="gemarra-regular">earlier. </span>Alternatively, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>Sending the goat away definitely took place earlier, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: </span>“But the goat on which the lot fell for Azazel <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be stood alive </span>before the Lord, to make atonement over him” (Leviticus 16:10). This teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">How long</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must it stand alive? </span>It must do so <span class="gemarra-regular">until the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> moment of atonement. And when is the moment of atonement</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">at the moment of the presenting of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blood, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">no later. </span>At that point it is already sent away.
§ The Gemara describes the eventual meeting between the High Priest and the one who sends the goat to Azazel: When the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sends </span>the goat <span class="gemarra-regular">comes </span>on the day following Yom Kippur, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he finds the High Priest in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the market, </span>which is a public place, <span class="gemarra-regular">he says </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: My Master, High Priest, we performed your mission,</span> i.e., we fulfilled the mitzva of sending the goat to Azazel. He refers to the sending as the High Priest’s mission as a public display of respect. But if <span class="gemarra-regular">he finds him in his house, he says to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: The One Who grants life to the living, </span>God,<span class="gemarra-regular">we performed His mission. </span>
Apropos the phrase: The One Who grants life to the living, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: When the Sages take leave from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one another in Pumbedita, they say as follows: May the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One Who grants life to the living grant you a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">long, good, and established life. </span>
Further apropos the phrase: The One Who grants life to the living, the Gemara explains a verse using a similar phrase and then additional verses. With regard to the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“I shall walk before the Lord</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the lands of the living” </span>(Psalms 116:9), <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: This is the place of markets, </span>where food and needs can be readily obtained. King David, who wandered from place to place, prayed to always find ready sustenance. 
The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For </span><span class="gemarra-regular">length of days, and years of life, and peace, will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they add to you” </span>(Proverbs 3:2). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there years of life and years that are not of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> life? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: </span>“Years of life” refers to good years. As such, <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>additional years of life referred to in the verse are the <span class="gemarra-regular">years</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a person’s life which are transformed for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from bad to good. </span>
The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“To you men</span> [<span class="gemarra-italic">ishim</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">do I call, </span>and my voice is to the sons of men” (Proverbs 8:4). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Berekhya said: </span>The word <span class="it-text">ishim</span>, although it means men, is similar to the term <span class="it-text">isha</span>, woman. It may therefore be taken to refer to <span class="gemarra-regular">these Torah scholars, who are similar to wome</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> in that they are physically weak and are not engaged in many activities that other men are, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">they act mightily like men </span>when engaged in Torah study. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Berekhya said </span>further about that same verse: Nowadays <span class="gemarra-regular">one who wishes to pour libations of wine over the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">altar should fill the throats of Torah scholars with wine,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: “To you men </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">ishim</span>]<span class="gemarra-regular"> do I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> call.” </span>The use of the phrase <span class="it-text">ishim</span>, which is similar to <span class="it-text">isheh</span>, used for the altar’s fire, suggests that scholars may be compared to the fire of the altar.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Berekhya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: If a person sees that Torah is ceasin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from his children, </span>and they are not becoming Torah scholars like himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should marry the daughter of a Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> scholar. </span>This will ensure that his children from her will be raised with Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Though its</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> root will grow old in the earth, and its trunk</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will die in the ground, </span>

Daf 71b

<span class="gemarra-regular">from the scent of wate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will blossom and put forth branches like a plant” </span>(Job 14:8–9). If the figurative trunk of one’s family is drying up through lack of Torah, he should plant himself in a place of water, i.e., a family of scholars, water being a metaphor for Torah. This will ensure that his children will blossom into Torah scholars.
§ It was taught in the mishna: The people escort the High Priest to his house. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he would make a feast for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his loved ones. The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">There was an incident involving one High Priest who exited </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy Temple and everyone followed him. When they saw </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shemaya and Avtalyon, </span>the heads of the Sanhedrin, walking along, in deference to them <span class="gemarra-regular">they left </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> himself and walked after Shemaya and Avtalyon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Eventually, Shemaya and Avtalyon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> came to take leave of the High Priest </span>before returning to their homes. Envious of the attention they received, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span> angrily <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Let the descendants of </span>the gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">nations come in peace</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Shemaya and Avtalyon descended from converts, and he scornfully drew attention to that fact. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: Let the descendants of the </span>gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">nations come in peace, who perform the acts of Aaron,</span> who loved and pursued peace; <span class="gemarra-regular">and let not a descendant</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Aaron come in peace, who does not perform the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> acts of Aaron </span>and who speaks condescendingly to descendants of converts.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Throughout the year <span class="gemarra-regular">the High Priest serves in eight garments, and the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> common priest </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">in four: In a tunic and trousers</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mitr</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and a belt. The High Priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> adds </span>another four garments <span class="gemarra-regular">beyond </span>those worn by the common priest: <span class="gemarra-regular">A breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">frontplate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> When dressed <span class="gemarra-regular">in these </span>eight garments, the High Priest may <span class="gemarra-regular">be consulted for </span>the decision of the <span class="gemarra-italic">Urim</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">VeTummim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And he may be consulted </span>for the decision of the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only on behalf of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">king, or on behalf of the president of the court, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or on behalf of one whom the community needs. </span>Individual inquiries are not posed to the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span>.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to those <span class="gemarra-regular">items </span>of the priestly vestments about which <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>they must be made with <span class="gemarra-regular">linen [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shesh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], their threads</span> are spun <span class="gemarra-regular">six-fold, </span>as suggested by the use of the term <span class="it-text">shesh</span>, which also means six. When the Torah states that certain items are <span class="gemarra-regular">twined, </span>it means their threads are spun <span class="gemarra-regular">eight</span>-<span class="gemarra-regular">fold</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>Threads used to weave the <span class="gemarra-regular">robe </span>were spun from <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve </span>strands. The threads of the <span class="gemarra-regular">curtain </span>were spun from <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-four </span>strands. The threads used to weave the <span class="gemarra-regular">breastplate and ephod </span>were spun from <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-eight </span>strands. 
The Gemara asks: That <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">threads </span>made from <span class="it-text">shesh</span> are spun <span class="gemarra-regular">six-fold, from where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do we </span>derive this? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “And they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">made the tunics of linen </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">shesh</span>] of woven work for Aaron and for his sons. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the mitre of linen, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and the adorning mitres of linen, and the linen [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span><span class="gemarra-regular">trousers of twined linen” </span>(Exodus 39:27–28). <span class="gemarra-regular">Five mentions </span>of the word linen are <span class="gemarra-regular">written; </span>four times as “<span class="it-text">shesh</span>” and an additional instance of “<span class="it-text">bad</span>,” both meaning linen. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>mention is stated <span class="gemarra-regular">for that </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, </span>to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">that they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">should be </span>made of <span class="gemarra-regular">linen. And one </span>mention is written to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">that the threads should be </span>spun <span class="gemarra-regular">six-fold,</span> <span class="it-text">shesh</span> being interpreted as six. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one </span>mention teaches that the six strands <span class="gemarra-regular">should be spun together </span>into one. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>mention teaches that this also applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to the other</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> garments, </span>even though the term <span class="gemarra-italic">shesh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not stated </span>with regard to them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one </span>mention teaches that this requirement is <span class="gemarra-regular">indispensable </span>and that garments not made this way are invalid.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where </span>may it <span class="gemarra-regular">be inferred that this </span>term <span class="gemarra-italic">shesh</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">linen? Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: As the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verse </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Bad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> and uses it interchangeably with <span class="it-text">shesh</span>. And <span class="it-text">bad</span> refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">something which sprouts from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the ground stalk by stalk [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bad</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">bad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>each one by itself. This is a fitting description of flax, the plant used to produce linen, as opposed to other plants, such as cotton, whose fibers grow meshed together. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And say </span>that it refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">wool, </span>since when it grows from the animal, each hair grows separately. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wool splits, </span>with each hair dividing into several hairs, so it does not fully fit the description of sprouting stalk by stalk. The Gemara asks: But <span class="gemarra-regular">flax</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> also splits </span>into individual hairs. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Flax, </span>unlike wool, <span class="gemarra-regular">splits </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">when beaten.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>We have a proof for the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: </span>The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“They shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have linen </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">pishtim</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">mitres upon their heads, and linen</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> trousers upon their loins” </span>(Ezekiel 44:18). The term <span class="it-text">pishtim</span> used in Ezekiel certainly refers to linen; therefore, it is clear that the terms <span class="it-text">shesh</span> and <span class="it-text">bad</span>, used in the Torah for the same garments, also refer to linen. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said to him: But before Ezekiel came, who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? How was it known? Ravina retorted: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to your reasoning, </span>the same question could be asked with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which Rav Ḥisda said </span>concerning the disqualification of an uncircumcised priest from serving in the Temple: <span class="gemarra-regular">This matter we did not learn from the Torah of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Moses our teacher, </span>as it is not written explicitly in the Torah; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned it from the words</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Ezekiel ben Buzi, </span>as the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“No </span><span class="gemarra-regular">foreigner, uncircumcised of heart or uncircumcised of flesh, shall enter </span><span class="gemarra-regular">into My sanctuary” </span>(Ezekiel 44:9). One could ask here as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">Before Ezekiel came, who said </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>perforce, <span class="gemarra-regular">they learned it as a tradition and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">Ezekiel </span><span class="gemarra-regular">came and supported it with a verse. Here, too, they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learned it as a tradition and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">Ezekiel came and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> supported it with a verse.</span>
The Gemara continues to explain the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. That the use of the term <span class="gemarra-regular">twined </span>implies that the thread should be spun from <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>strands, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where do we </span>derive this? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “And they made upon the skirts</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the robe pomegranates of sky-blue, and purple, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> scarlet, twined” </span>(Exodus 39:24); <span class="gemarra-regular">and derive </span>a verbal analogy from the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“twined” </span>used in this verse and the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“twined” from </span>the verse about <span class="gemarra-regular">the curtain: Just as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there, </span>with regard to the curtain, there are <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>strands, as will be explained, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too here, </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-four </span>strands in total. And since each pomegranate is made of three colors, sky-blue, purple, and scarlet, it must be <span class="gemarra-regular">that each one of them was </span>spun from <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>strands. 
The Gemara challenges this derivation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us derive </span>the number of strands instead <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">breastplate and ephod </span>and say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>with regard to the breastplate and ephod, there are <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-eight </span>strands, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-eight </span>strands. The Gemara answers: It is preferable to <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">an item, </span>i.e., the pomegranates, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to which </span>the use of <span class="gemarra-regular">gold </span>threads <span class="gemarra-regular">is not stated, from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">item, </span>i.e., the curtain, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to which </span>the use of <span class="gemarra-regular">gold </span>threads <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">not stated. </span>This would come <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the possibility of deriving them from the <span class="gemarra-regular">breastplate and ephod, with regard to which </span>the use of <span class="gemarra-regular">gold </span>threads <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contrary, </span>it should be preferable to <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of one <span class="gemarra-regular">garment from </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">garment, </span>i.e., the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the robe from the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the breastplate and ephod. This would come <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the possibility of deriving them from the <span class="gemarra-regular">curtain, which is a tent, </span>i.e., part of the Temple building, and not a garment. The Gemara accepts that the derivation is flawed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the need for thread of eight strands <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the belt, </span>which had twenty-four threads in total, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a garment and an item with regard to which </span>the use of <span class="gemarra-regular">gold </span>thread <span class="gemarra-regular">is not stated, </span>i.e., the pomegranates, <span class="gemarra-regular">are derived </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">a garment and an item</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to which </span>the use of <span class="gemarra-regular">gold </span>thread <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not stated. And an item with no gold, </span>such as the pomegranates and robe, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not derived from an item</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that has gold in it, </span>such as the breastplate and ephod. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mari said </span>another reason not to derive the number of strands in a pomegranate from the breastplate and ephod: “Like the work of the ephod <span class="gemarra-regular">you shall make it” </span>(Exodus 28:15) <span class="gemarra-regular">is written</span> with regard to the breastplate to indicate that <span class="gemarra-regular">you shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> make it, </span>i.e., the breastplate, like the ephod, which indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">for this, </span>i.e., the breastplate, you shall use thread of twenty-eight strands, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not for anything</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> else. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said </span>another reason that there could not be twenty-eight strands in a pomegranate: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall make </span>pomegranates of sky-blue, and of purple, and of scarlet” (Exodus 28:33) <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>to indicate <span class="gemarra-regular">that all the makings of it must </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be equal, </span>i.e., that each color thread should be made from the same number of strands. However, if there are twenty-eight strands in total, the three threads, each of a different color, cannot be made with an equal number of strands, as <span class="gemarra-regular">how should we do </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us make three </span>colored threads <span class="gemarra-regular">of ten </span>strands <span class="gemarra-regular">each; </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">they are thirty </span>strands in total, which is too many. <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us make two </span>colored threads <span class="gemarra-regular">of nine </span>strands <span class="gemarra-regular">and one of ten; </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall make,” </span>to indicate <span class="gemarra-regular">that all the makings of it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">must be equal. </span>Perforce, the threads used for the pomegranates and the robe must be derived from an item woven from threads of a number of strands divisible by three, such as the curtain. 
The Gemara continues to explain the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: That the <span class="gemarra-regular">robe </span>must be woven from threads spun from <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve </span>strands, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where do we</span> derive this? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “And you shall make</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the robe of the ephod</span>

Daf 72a

<span class="gemarra-regular">spun of sky-blue” </span>(Exodus 28:31). <span class="gemarra-regular">And derive</span> a verbal analogy from the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“sky-blue” </span>used here and the same term <span class="gemarra-regular">“sky-blue” from </span>the verse about <span class="gemarra-regular">the curtain: Just as there, </span>with regard to the curtain, there are <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>strands, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too here, </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>strands. Then, since the Torah also says the threads are spun, i.e., each strand is made of two thinner strands spun together, each thread must contain twelve strands.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us derive </span>the number of strands in the robe <span class="gemarra-regular">from its hem and pomegranates: Just as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there, </span>each thread is spun from <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>strands, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span><span class="gemarra-regular">too here, </span>the threads should be spun from <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>strands. The Gemara rejects this: It is preferable to <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a utensil, </span>i.e., the robe, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of another <span class="gemarra-regular">utensil, </span>i.e., the curtain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one should <span class="gemarra-regular">not derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a utensil from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of something that is merely <span class="gemarra-regular">an ornament of a utensil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the pomegranates of the robe. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">On the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> contrary, </span>it is preferable to <span class="gemarra-regular">derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">an object from that object itself, </span>i.e., to assume that the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the robe and its pomegranates are similar; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one should <span class="gemarra-regular">not derive </span>the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of an <span class="gemarra-regular">object from elsewhere. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">what we said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: One of the five mentions of <span class="it-text">shesh</span> in the verse is to teach that the requirement that threads be made from six strands applies also <span class="gemarra-regular">to other garments about which </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shesh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">stated, </span>such as the robe.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> further states: Each thread of the <span class="gemarra-regular">curtain </span>was made of <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-four </span>strands. The Gemara explains: With regard to each thread being composed of <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>colored threads: White, purple, scarlet, and sky-blue, and <span class="gemarra-regular">each one </span>of them being composed <span class="gemarra-regular">of six </span>strands, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is neither judgment nor judge, </span>i.e., it is absolutely clear that this is how the threads of the curtain are produced.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> further states: Each thread of the <span class="gemarra-regular">breastplate and ephod </span>was made of <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-eight </span>strands. <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do we </span>derive this? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “And you shall make a breastplate of judgment, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">work of the skilled craftsman; like the work of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ephod you shall make it: Of gold, sky-blue, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen” </span>(Exodus 28:15). There are <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>colored threads, <span class="gemarra-regular">each </span>composed <span class="gemarra-regular">of six </span>strands, which makes <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-four. </span>In addition, <span class="gemarra-regular">gold </span>is spun together with each of the <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>colors, giving the total of <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-eight.</span>
But couldn’t one <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">gold </span>should be made as a thread of <span class="gemarra-regular">six </span>strands, like the other colors? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: </span>“And they beat the gold into thin plates, <span class="gemarra-regular">and cut it into cords, </span>to work it into the sky-blue, and into the purple, and into the scarlet, and into the fine linen, the work of a skilled craftsman” (Exodus 39:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">“Cord” </span>implies a strand that is doubled over and can be twisted into a cord; <span class="gemarra-regular">“cords” </span>is in the plural, meaning at least two of these. <span class="gemarra-regular">Accordingly, there are four </span>strands <span class="gemarra-regular">here. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>This can be seen from that fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states </span>with regard to the gold strands: <span class="gemarra-regular">“To work it into the sky-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">blue, and into the purple” </span>(Exodus 39:3), indicating that the gold strands should be combined with the other colors. <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span> should <span class="gemarra-regular">we do? </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">we make four </span>gold threads <span class="gemarra-regular">of two </span>strands <span class="gemarra-regular">each </span>and combine each one with each of the colors, then <span class="gemarra-regular">there would be eight</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If <span class="gemarra-regular">we make two </span>gold threads <span class="gemarra-regular">of two </span>strands <span class="gemarra-regular">each, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two </span>gold threads <span class="gemarra-regular">of one </span>strand <span class="gemarra-regular">each, </span>it says: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And you shall make,” </span>indicating <span class="gemarra-regular">that all its makings should</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be the same. </span>Perforce, one strand of gold should be combined with each of the colors, producing a total of twenty-eight strands.
§ The Gemara discusses various <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> concerning the priestly vestments and other sacred vessels: <span class="gemarra-regular">Raḥava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: One who </span>intentionally <span class="gemarra-regular">tears</span> any of the <span class="gemarra-regular">priestly vestment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> transgresses a prohibition and <span class="gemarra-regular">is flogged, as it is stated </span>concerning the robe: “It shall have a hem of woven work around the opening of it, like the opening of a coat of mail, and <span class="gemarra-regular">it shall not be torn” </span>(Exodus 28:32). Just as it is prohibited to tear the opening of the robe, so too, it is prohibited to tear any of the priestly vestments. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov strongly objects to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this: But perhaps this is what the Merciful One is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> saying </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">An opening should be made in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> order that it not tear. </span>In other words, the Torah was giving an explanation, not a prohibition. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it written: In order that it not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be torn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Clearly, the intention of the verse is to state a prohibition. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: One who detaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the breastplate from upon the epho</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">removes the staves of the Ar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> from their rings transgresses a Torah prohibition and <span class="gemarra-regular">is flogged, as it is stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>“And the breastplate <span class="gemarra-regular">shall not be detached </span>from the ephod” (Exodus 28:28),and it is also stated: “The staves shall be in the rings of the Ark; <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall not be removed </span>from it” (Exodus 25:15). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Aḥa bar Ya’akov strongly objects to this: </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when the Merciful One said </span>this in the Torah, the intention was <span class="gemarra-regular">to strengthen them and make them fast so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>the breastplate <span class="gemarra-regular">not become detached </span>from the ephod <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> the staves <span class="gemarra-regular">not be removed. </span>He suggests that the Torah was giving an explanation, not a prohibition. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it written: In order that it not become</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> detached, and: In order that they not be removed? </span>Clearly, the intention of the verse is to state a prohibition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥanina, raised a contradiction. </span>In one verse <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “The staves shall be in the rings of the Ark</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; they shall not be removed from it” </span>(Exodus 25:15), implying the staves should remain there permanently. But in another verse <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And its staves shall be put </span><span class="gemarra-regular">into the rings” </span>(Exodus 27:7), implying that when the Ark is used the staves are inserted, which suggests that they do not remain there permanently. <span class="gemarra-regular">How is this </span>contradiction resolved? The staves <span class="gemarra-regular">could be removed </span>from their position, i.e., they were loosened, but <span class="gemarra-regular">did not come out</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The staves were wider at their ends and thinner in the middle. Therefore, once they had been forced into the rings, although they could be shifted, they would not be removed entirely.
<span class="gemarra-regular">That was also </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The staves </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall be in the rings of the Ark; </span>they shall not be removed from it” (Exodus 25:15). One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">they should not move from their place </span>at all; therefore; <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And its staves shall be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> put into the rings” </span>(Exodus 27:7). <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it had stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">And its staves shall be put, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are inserted and removed </span>entirely; therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verse states: “The staves shall be in the rings of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Ark; </span>they shall not be removed from it” (Exodus 25:15). <span class="gemarra-regular">How is this? They could be removed </span>from their position, but <span class="gemarra-regular">did not come out.</span>
The Gemara cites other statements concerning the ark. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥama, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: </span>“And you shall make the boards for the Tabernacle of <span class="gemarra-regular">acacia wood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> standing” </span>(Exodus 26:15)? This verse teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the boards of wood used for the Tabernacle should <span class="gemarra-regular">stand in the </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">direction in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which they grew </span>from the ground as a tree. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">standing” </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">that they supported their </span>gold <span class="gemarra-regular">platin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> and prevented it from falling. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, “standing” </span>is written to hint at the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps you will say </span>that now that the Tabernacle is no longer in use, <span class="gemarra-regular">their hope is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lost and their chance is abandoned, </span>and after being stored away the boards will no longer return to use. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states “standing” </span>to indicate <span class="gemarra-regular">that they stand</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forever and ever. </span>
§ The Gemara returns to its discussion of the priestly vestments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> plaited </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">serad</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">garments, for serving in the Sanctuary” </span>(Exodus 35:19)? Why does the verse refer to the priestly vestments as “<span class="it-text">serad</span> garments”? 

Daf 72b

He offers a homiletic interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Were it not for the priestly vestments</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which provide atonement for the Jewish people, <span class="gemarra-regular">there would not remain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a remnant </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">sarid</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">or survivor from the haters of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Jewish people, </span>a euphemism used to refer to the Jewish people themselves. Due to the atonement provided by the priestly vestments, a remnant [<span class="it-text">sarid</span>] of the Jewish people does survive. 
Another interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the school </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon taught: </span>The priestly vestments are referred to as “<span class="it-text">serad</span> garments” because they are <span class="gemarra-regular">garments that are woven in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">their completed form upon the loom, </span>as opposed to weaving the material and then cutting and sewing pieces of the material together to create the required form, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then just <span class="gemarra-regular">a small part of them remains </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">masridin</span>] which is not completed upon the loom. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the remnant, the part that was not woven? <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: This is the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> needle-work </span>required to complete the garment. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection to this </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Priestly vestments </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">not be made through needle-work</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>though <span class="gemarra-regular">woven work, as it is stated: “Woven</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> work” </span>(Exodus 28:32). The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>Reish Lakish’s statement <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary only for, </span>i.e., refers only to, <span class="gemarra-regular">the sleeves. As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A sleeve </span>made for the <span class="gemarra-regular">priestly vestment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is woven separately and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">attached to the garment </span>by sewing, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the sleeve is made to <span class="gemarra-regular">reach as far </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as the palm of the hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> However, the main body of the garment must indeed be made exclusively though weaving.
§ The Gemara cites statements concerning other Temple vessels: <span class="gemarra-regular">Raḥava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: </span>The Torah states that the Ark should be made of wood with gold plating inside and out (Exodus 25:10–11). In order to achieve this <span class="gemarra-regular">Bezalel made three</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> arks: A middle one </span>made <span class="gemarra-regular">of wood, </span>whose height was <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span>handbreadths; <span class="gemarra-regular">an inner one </span>made <span class="gemarra-regular">of gold, </span>whose height was <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>handbreadths; and an <span class="gemarra-regular">outer one </span>of gold, whose height was <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">and a bit. </span>These arks were nested. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the outer ark was <span class="gemarra-regular">eleven </span>handbreadths <span class="gemarra-regular">and a bit? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is not difficult: This </span>statement in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is in accordance with the one who said</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the thickness </span>of the gold plating <span class="gemarra-regular">was one handbreadth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>According to this opinion, the outer ark’s base took up one handbreadth of its height, ten handbreadths were then needed to contain the middle ark within it, and then a bit more was needed so it could also contain the Ark’s cover. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>statement of Rav Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">is in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the thickness </span>of the gold plating <span class="gemarra-regular">was not one handbreadth </span>but was a plate of gold of negligible thickness. According to this opinion, the outer ark needed to be only ten handbreadths and a bit and could still contain the outer ark and have room for the cover. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is </span>this additional <span class="gemarra-regular">bit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It is the ornamental <span class="gemarra-regular">crown </span>on the edge of the outer ark. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: There </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">three crowns</span> on the sacred vessels in the Temple: The crown <span class="gemarra-regular">of the altar, and of the Ark, and of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">table. </span>The regal appearance they provided symbolized power and authority: The crown <span class="gemarra-regular">of the altar </span>symbolized the crown of priesthood; <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron was deserving and took it, </span>and the priesthood continues exclusively through his descendants. The crown <span class="gemarra-regular">of the table </span>symbolized the abundance and blessing associated with the crown of kingship; <span class="gemarra-regular">David was deserving and took it </span>for himself and his descendants after him. The crown <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Ark </span>symbolized the crown of Torah; <span class="gemarra-regular">it is still sitting </span>and waiting to be acquired, <span class="gemarra-regular">and anyone who wishes to take </span>it may <span class="gemarra-regular">come and take </span>it and be crowned with the crown of Torah. <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps you will say it is inferio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> to the other two crowns and that is why nobody has taken it; therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states </span>about the wisdom of Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Through me kings will reign” </span>(Proverbs 8:15), indicating that the strength of the other crowns is derived from the crown of Torah, which is greater than them all.
§ The Gemara presents a number of statements based on the idea that the Ark symbolizes the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan raised a contradiction:</span> According to the way the word crown <span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>in the Torah (Exodus 25:11), without vowels, it should be pronounced <span class="gemarra-italic">zar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>meaning strange, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>according to the traditional vocalization <span class="gemarra-regular">we read </span>it as <span class="gemarra-italic">zeir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>meaning crown. These two ways of understanding the word appear to contradict each other. Rabbi Yoḥanan explains: The two understandings apply to two different situations: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">is deserving </span>by performing mitzvot, <span class="gemarra-regular">it becomes a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> crown [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zeir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] for him; </span>but if one <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">deserving, </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">will be a stranger [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zara</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to him </span>and he will forget his studies. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan raised a contradiction: It is written: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And you shall make for yourself a wooden Ark” </span>(Deuteronomy 10:1), implying that Moses alone was commanded to construct the Ark; <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written: “And they shall make an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ark of acacia wood” </span>(Exodus 25:10), implying that the Jewish people were all commanded to be involved in its construction. The apparent resolution to this contradiction is that although only Moses actually constructed the Ark, everyone was required to support the endeavor. So too, <span class="gemarra-regular">from here </span>it is derived with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to a Torah scholar that the members of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his town should perform his work for him </span>to support him and allow him to focus on his studies, since it is also the town’s responsibility to enable him to study.
The verse states concerning the Ark: <span class="gemarra-regular">“From within and from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">without you shall cover it” </span>(Exodus 25:11). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>This alludes to the idea that <span class="gemarra-regular">any Torah scholar whose </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inside is not like his outside, </span>i.e., whose outward expression of righteousness is insincere, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>to be considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a Torah scholar. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Ulla </span>who said: Not only is such a person not to be considered a Torah scholar, but he is <span class="gemarra-regular">called loathsome, as it is stated: “What then</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of one loathsome and foul, man who drinks iniquity like</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> water” </span>(Job 15:16). Although he drinks the Torah like water, since he sins, his Torah is considered iniquitous and this makes him loathsome and foul. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan said: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “Why is there a price in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, as he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has no heart?” </span>(Proverbs 17:16)? This expresses the following sentiment: <span class="gemarra-regular">Woe to them, haters ofTorah scholars, </span>a euphemism for the Torah scholars themselves, <span class="gemarra-regular">who immerse themselves in Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and have no fear of Heaven. </span>They are fools; they try to acquire the wisdom of Torah, but since they have no fear of Heaven in their hearts they lack the ability to do so. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yannai declared </span>that the situation may be expressed by the following sentiment: <span class="gemarra-regular">Pity </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">who has no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> courtyard but </span>senselessly <span class="gemarra-regular">makes a gate for his courtyard. </span>Fear of Heaven is like the courtyard, and the study of Torah is the gate that provides entrance to the courtyard. The study of Torah is purposeful only if it leads to fear of Heaven.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to the Sages </span>in the study hall: <span class="gemarra-regular">I beg of you, do not inherit Gehenna twice</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> By studying Torah without the accompanying fear of Heaven, not only are you undeserving of the World-to-Come, but even in this world you experience Gehenna, as you spend all your time in study and fail to benefit from worldly pleasure.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Levi said: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: “And this is the Torah which Moses put </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">sam</span>] before the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 4:44)? The word <span class="it-text">sam</span> is written with the letter <span class="it-text">sin</span> and means put; it is phonetically similar to the word <span class="it-text">sam</span> written with the letter <span class="it-text">samekh</span>, meaning a drug. This use of this word therefore alludes to the following: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">is deserving</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes a potion [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of life for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">is not deserving, </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes a potion</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of death for him. And this </span>idea <span class="gemarra-regular">is what Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: For one who is skillful </span>in his study of Torah and immerses himself in it with love, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a potion of life; </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">for one who is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> skillful </span>in his studies, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a potion of death</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan raised a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contradiction: It was written: “The precepts of the Lord are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upright, gladdening the heart” </span>(Psalms 19:9), but it is also written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The word of the Lord is refining” </span>(Psalms 18:31), which implies that the study of Torah can be a distressing process by which a person is refined like metal smelted in a smith’s fire. He reconciles these verses as follows: For one who <span class="gemarra-regular">is deserving, </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">gladdens him; </span>for one who <span class="gemarra-regular">is not deserving, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">refines</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him. Reish Lakish said: </span>This lesson <span class="gemarra-regular">emerges from that </span>second <span class="gemarra-regular">verse itself: </span>For one who <span class="gemarra-regular">is deserving, </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">refines him for life; </span>for one who <span class="gemarra-regular">is not deserving, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it refines him for death. </span>
The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Fear of the Lord is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pure, it stands forever” </span>(Psalms 19:10). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who studies Torah in purity; </span>for such a person the Torah will remain with him forever. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is this; </span>what does it mean to study in purity? <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">marries a woman and afterward studies</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Torah. </span>Since he is married, his heart will not be occupied with thoughts of sin, which could lead him to become impure. 
In the same Psalm the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The testimony of God is faithful” </span>(Psalms 19:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥiyya bar Abba said: </span>This alludes to the fact that the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">is faithful to testify about those who study </span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and those who do not.
The Gemara returns to its discussion concerning the sacred vessels: The verse states with regard to the covers for the Tabernacle that they are <span class="gemarra-regular">“work of an embroiderer” </span>(Exodus 26:36), and it also states they are <span class="gemarra-regular">“work of a designer” </span>(Exodus 26:31). How can both descriptions be reconciled? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: They embroidered the place where they had designed. </span>They first marked a design on the material in paint, and then they embroidered it. 
A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught in the name of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya: </span>“Work of <span class="gemarra-regular">an embroiderer” </span>refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">needlework, </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">therefore </span>produces only <span class="gemarra-regular">one face. </span>The design is made with a needle passing back and forth from both sides of the curtain, and consequently an identical parallel image, or one face, is formed on both sides. “Work of <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> designer” </span>refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">woven work, </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">therefore </span>produces <span class="gemarra-regular">two faces</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Although formed together, the two sides of the material were not identical; for example, sometimes an eagle appeared on one side while a lion was on the other side.
§ It was taught in the mishna: When dressed <span class="gemarra-regular">in these </span>eight garments, the High Priest may <span class="gemarra-regular">be consulted for </span>the decision of the <span class="gemarra-italic">Urim</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">VeTummim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. When Rav Dimi came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">garments in which the High Priest serves </span>are also worn when the <span class="gemarra-regular">priest anointed for war serves. </span>This priest is appointed to recite words of encouragement to the nation before it goes out to war (see Deuteronomy 20:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: “And the sacred garments of Aaron</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall be for his sons after him” </span>(Exodus 29:29), which is taken to refer <span class="gemarra-regular">to the one who comes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">after him in greatness, </span>meaning the priest whose rank is one lower than the High Priest, i.e., the priest anointed for war. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ahava raised an objection, and some say it unattributed: </span>It is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">the son of the priest anointed for war serves in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his place, </span>i.e., he inherits the position, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> same way that the son of a High Priest serves</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in his place </span>if he is fit for the job; 

Daf 73a

therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “Seven days shall he wear them, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one who serves in his stead from among his sons</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who comes into the Tent of Meeting </span>to serve in the Sanctuary” (Exodus 29:30). The verse describes a son serving in the place of his father, indicating that the position is inherited. The conclusion of the verse implies that the rule that a son inherits his father’s position applies only to a High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">who is fit to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">enter the Tent of Meeting, </span>but not to the priest anointed for war. Based on this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the following challenge is posed: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is so, </span>since the priest anointed for war also serves wearing the same garments as the High Priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">fit </span>to enter the Tent of Meeting and should bequeath his position to his son.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>The rule that a son inherits his father’s position applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone for whom the primary purpose</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of his anointment </span>is to come and serve in the <span class="gemarra-regular">Tent of Meeting. </span>That <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes this </span>priest <span class="gemarra-regular">for whom the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> primary purpose of his anointment is for war.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an objection </span>to Rav Dimi’s claim: It was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the priest anointed for war </span><span class="gemarra-regular">serves neither in four </span>garments, <span class="gemarra-regular">like a common </span>priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in eight </span>garments, <span class="gemarra-regular">like a High Priest.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: </span>Would <span class="gemarra-regular">you make him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like a non-priest? </span>If he dresses like neither a High Priest nor a common priest, then effectively he is like a non-priest, but that is certainly not true. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the meaning of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is that the priest anointed for war does not dress <span class="gemarra-regular">like a High Priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> due to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">animosity </span>that could be caused between him and the High Priest if they both wore similar garments. Therefore, although according to Torah law the priest anointed for war should dress like a High Priest, the Sages decreed that he should not, out of concern that animosity might result. And he does not dress <span class="gemarra-regular">like a common priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, due to </span>the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">One elevates </span>to a higher level <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>matters of <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctity and one does not downgrade</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since the priest anointed for war attained the level of sanctity of a High Priest, he may not now be demoted to serve as an ordinary priest and dress accordingly.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Abba said to Rava: But</span> there is <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">who does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>accept the concern of <span class="gemarra-regular">animosity </span>as a reason to prevent one from wearing similar garments, and yet even according to him the priest anointed for war <span class="gemarra-regular">does not serve</span> wearing the eight garments. Clearly, there must be a different reason.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The matters in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which </span>there are differences <span class="gemarra-regular">between a High Priest and a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> common </span>priest are as follows: <br><span class="gemarra-regular">The bull of the anointed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> priest, </span>also called <span class="gemarra-regular">the bull brought for all the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is brought for unwittingly deciding and following an erroneous halakhic ruling in a case for which one would be liable to receive the penalty of <span class="it-text">karet</span> had he committed it intentionally; <br><span class="gemarra-regular">And the bull of Yom Kippur; </span><br><span class="gemarra-regular">And the tenth of an ephah </span>that the High Priest offers each day. <br>Only the High Priest brings the above offerings.
In addition, when in mourning, a High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">does not let </span>his hair <span class="gemarra-regular">grow wild, nor does he rend </span>his clothing in the way other mourners do. <span class="gemarra-regular">But he does rend </span>his clothing <span class="gemarra-regular">from below, </span>in a place that is not noticeable, while <span class="gemarra-regular">the common </span>priest rends <span class="gemarra-regular">from above </span>in the normal manner. <br><span class="gemarra-regular">And he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not become ritually impure </span>in the event of the death of <span class="gemarra-regular">his close relatives, </span>but a common priest may. <br><span class="gemarra-regular">And he is commanded to </span>marry a <span class="gemarra-regular">virgin, and he is prohibited from </span>marrying a <span class="gemarra-regular">widow, </span>in contrast to a common priest who is prohibited to marry only a divorcee. <br><span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>his death <span class="gemarra-regular">allows the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> return of the </span>accidental <span class="gemarra-regular">killer </span>from the city of refuge. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And he sacrifices </span>offerings even when he is <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">acute mourner, </span>i.e., on the first day of his mourning, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he may not eat </span>from the offerings on that day <span class="gemarra-regular">and he may not take a portion </span>from them. <br><span class="gemarra-regular">And he takes </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">portion first </span>from any offering of his choice. <br><span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>he has the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>right <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sacrifice </span>any offering he wants. <br><span class="gemarra-regular">And he serves </span>wearing <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span><span class="gemarra-regular">garments. </span><br><span class="gemarra-regular">And he is exempt from </span>bringing an offering for unwittingly causing <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity to the Temple and its sacred</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> objects. </span><br><span class="gemarra-regular">And all </span>parts of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur service </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are valid only </span>when performed <span class="gemarra-regular">by him. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And all these </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span> unique to the High Priest are not limited to one who was consecrated with anointing oil, but <span class="gemarra-regular">apply </span>also to a High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">of many </span><span class="gemarra-regular">garments. </span>During the Second Temple period, when the oil used for anointing was no longer available for anointing High Priests, the High Priests were consecrated by virtue of wearing the eight garments. This is true <span class="gemarra-regular">except </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bull brought for all the mitzvot, </span>which is brought only by a High Priest consecrated with anointing oil.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And all these</span> <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">apply to a former High Priest </span>who had been consecrated to substitute for a High Priest who had become disqualified. If the disqualification of the original High Priest is removed, he may return to his position. Although the substitute no longer serves as a High Priest, he retains the sanctity of a High Priest and the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the High Priest continue to apply to him. This is true <span class="gemarra-regular">except </span>with regard to the sacrifice of <span class="gemarra-regular">the bull on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yom Kippur and </span>the sacrifice of <span class="gemarra-regular">the tenth of an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ephah </span>each day. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And none of them applies to the priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> anointed for war, except for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">five items stated </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">in the passage </span>about the High Priest (Leviticus 21:10–15): <br>When in mourning, he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not let </span>his hair <span class="gemarra-regular">grow wild</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor does he rend </span>his clothing in the way regular mourners do. <br><span class="gemarra-regular">And he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not become ritually impure </span>in the event of the death of <span class="gemarra-regular">his close relatives. </span><br><span class="gemarra-regular">And he is commanded to </span>marry <span class="gemarra-regular">a virgin, and he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited from </span>marrying <span class="gemarra-regular">a widow. </span><br><span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>his death <span class="gemarra-regular">allows</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the return of the </span>accidental <span class="gemarra-regular">killer </span>from the city of refuge, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yehuda </span>in tractate <span class="it-text">Makkot</span> (11a). <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: </span>His death <span class="gemarra-regular">does not allow the return </span>of the accidental killer from the city of refuge.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that a former High Priest also wears the eight garments of the High Priest. It is therefore apparent that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is not concerned about animosity which could be caused if the High Priest and the former High Priest wear similar garments. Despite this, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> agrees that the priest anointed for war does not wear the eight garments. This suggests that the reason for this is not out of concern that animosity might result. The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">has no animosity </span>toward someone else wearing the same garments, it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>that person <span class="gemarra-regular">is similar to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him, </span>such as a former High Priest who held the same rank. But toward someone <span class="gemarra-regular">inferior to him </span>who wears the same garments, such as the priest anointed for war, <span class="gemarra-regular">he does </span>feel animosity.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu was sitting</span> before the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">and saying this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> of Rav Dimi, that the priest anointed for war serves in the same garments as the High Priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan. Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi turned their faces </span>away to show that they disagreed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>it was not RabbiAbbahu but <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it, and </span>it was away from him that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi Asi turned their faces. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa strongly objects to </span>the alternative account: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>if you say that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu </span>reported the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, it is understandable that Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi did not state outright that they disagreed with him <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">honor of the house of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">caesar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as Rabbi Abbahu was close to the government (see <span class="it-text">Ḥagiga</span> 14a). <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if the alternative account were true, then <span class="gemarra-regular">they should have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said outright to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba </span>that they held that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan did not say this, </span>since there would have been no reason not to have done so. Therefore, Rav Pappa claimed this account must be incorrect. 
The Gemara cites an opinion that conflicts with that of Rav Dimi: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Ravin came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The teaching that the priest anointed for war wears the eight garments of the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>only with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">being consulted </span>for the decision of the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span>. To be consulted he must wear all eight garments; however, he never serves in them. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The garments in which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the High Priest serves </span>are also worn when the <span class="gemarra-regular">priest </span><span class="gemarra-regular">anointed for war is consulted </span>for the decision of the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span>.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: How does one consult </span>the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">The one asking </span>stands with <span class="gemarra-regular">his face toward the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one who is asked, </span>i.e., the High Priest or the priest anointed for war. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the one who is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> asked, </span>the High Priest, turns <span class="gemarra-regular">his face toward the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Divine Presence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span>, in which the explicit name of God is found, by tilting his head downward toward it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one who asks says </span>his question, e.g.: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Shall I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pursue after this troop?” </span>(I Samuel 30:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">And the one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who is asked </span>answers him according to the response he receives and <span class="gemarra-regular">says, </span>for example: <span class="gemarra-regular">Thus says God: Go up </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and succeed. Rabbi Yehuda says: He need not say </span>the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">Thus says God; rather, </span>it is sufficient to relay the content of the response and say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go up and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> succeed, </span>since he is obviously only repeating what he was told. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">One does not ask in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>loud <span class="gemarra-regular">voice, as it is stated: “And </span>he shall stand before Elazar the priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">who shall inquire for hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> by the judgment of the <span class="it-text">Urim</span>” (Numbers 27:21), which implies that the inquiry is to be audible only to the person asking. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he should not think </span>his question <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his heart </span>but should enunciate it, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated: “And…who shall inquire for him </span>by the judgment of the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before God” </span>(Numbers 27:21), and immediately afterward it states: “By his mouth” (Numbers 27:21). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather,</span> how shall he inquire? He should do so <span class="gemarra-regular">akin to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the way that Hannah spoke in her prayer, as it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is stated: “Now Hannah spoke in her heart; </span>only her lips moved, but her voice could not be heard” (I Samuel 1:13), which indicates she did enunciate the words but spoke so quietly that no one else could hear.
<span class="gemarra-regular">One does not ask </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">two matters simultaneously; </span>rather, one asks one question, and after he is answered he asks a second question. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">if he asks </span>about two matters simultaneously, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is answered only </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he is answered only </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>question. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated </span>with regard to King David that he asked two questions simultaneously: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Will the men of Keilah deliver me into his hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Will Saul come down?” </span>(I Samuel 23:11). And he was answered with regard to only one: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And God said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: He will come down.” </span>(I Samuel 23:11). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t you say </span>that if one asks two questions, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">answered only </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>question? Yet the verse states that David received an answer for his second question, not the first. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">David asked </span>the questions

Daf 73b

<span class="gemarra-regular">out of order and he was answered in order</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> He should have asked first whether Saul would come down, and afterward what the people of Keilah would do. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> once he realized that he had asked out of order</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he went back and asked in order, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated </span>immediately afterward: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Will the men of Keilah deliver </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me and my men into the hand of Saul? And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> God said: They will deliver you” </span>(I Samuel 23:12).
<span class="gemarra-regular">But if the matter </span>is urgent and <span class="gemarra-regular">requires </span>asking <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>questions simultaneously, there being no time to follow the standard protocol, one may ask both questions simultaneously and <span class="gemarra-regular">he is answered </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>questions together, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And David asked</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of God, saying: Shall I pursue after this troop? Will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I overtake them? And He answered him: Pursue, for you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will surely overtake them, and will surely rescue” </span>(I Samuel 30:8). 
The Gemara notes the reliability of the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even though a decree of a prophet </span><span class="gemarra-regular">can be retracted, </span>as sometimes a dire prophecy is stated as a warning and does not come true, <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Urim</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">VeTummim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cannot be retracted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is stated: “By the judgment of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Urim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Numbers 27:21). The use of the term judgment suggests that the decree is as final as a judicial decision. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Why is it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">called </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Urim</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">VeTummim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Urim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is based on the word <span class="it-text">or</span>, light, is so called because <span class="gemarra-regular">it illuminates </span>and explains <span class="gemarra-regular">its words. </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Tummim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is based on the word <span class="it-text">tam</span>, completed, is because <span class="gemarra-regular">it fulfills its words, </span>which always come true.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if you say: In the </span>battles following the incidents in <span class="gemarra-regular">Gibeah of Benjamin </span>(Judges 19–20), <span class="gemarra-regular">why did </span>the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">not fulfill </span>its words? The Jewish People consulted the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span> three times with regard to their decision to attack the tribe of Benjamin, and each time they were instructed to go to battle. However, the first two times they were defeated and only on the third attempt were they successful. Is this not proof that the <span class="it-text">UrimVeTummim</span> does not always fulfill its words?
The Gemara answers: The first two times <span class="gemarra-regular">they did not check</span> with the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">whether they would be victorious or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be defeated </span>but only inquired how and whether they should go to battle. Had they asked, they indeed would have been told that they would not succeed. <span class="gemarra-regular">But on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> last time, when they did check </span>and inquire whether they would be successful, the <span class="it-text">UrimVeTummim</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">agreed </span>with them that they should go to battle and that they would succeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And Pinehas, the son of Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, saying: Shall I yet again go out to battle against</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? And God said: Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him into your hand” </span>(Judges 20:28).
<span class="gemarra-regular">How is it done</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> How does the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span> provide an answer? The names of the twelve tribes were engraved upon the stones of the breastplate. These letters allowed for the answer to be received. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan says: </span>The letters of the answer <span class="gemarra-regular">protrude, </span>and the priest then combines those letters to form words in order to ascertain the message. <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish says: </span>The letters rearrange themselves and <span class="gemarra-regular">joi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> together to form words. 
The Gemara asks: How was it possible to receive an answer to every question? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the letter <span class="gemarra-italic">tzadi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not writte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> within the names of the twelve tribes engraved on the breastplate’s stones. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said: </span>The names <span class="gemarra-regular">Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">written there. </span>The name <span class="it-text">Yitzḥak</span>, Isaac, contains the letter <span class="it-text">tzadi</span>. The Gemara asks again: <span class="gemarra-regular">But surely </span>the letter <span class="gemarra-italic">tet</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was not written </span>on the breastplate, since it is not found in the names of the Patriarchs nor in the names of the twelve tribes. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Ya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’akov said: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shivtei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">Yeshurun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the tribes of Jeshurun, <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">written there. </span>The word <span class="it-text">shivtei</span>, tribes, contains the letter <span class="it-text">tet</span>. In this way the entire alphabet was represented. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> priest who does not speak with Divine Spiri</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upon whom the Divine Presence does not rest is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">consulted </span>to inquire of the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Zadok inquired </span>of the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and it was effective for him, </span>and he received an answer; but <span class="gemarra-regular">Ebiathar </span>inquired <span class="gemarra-regular">and it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was not effective for him, </span>and he did not receive an answer. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: “But Ebiathar went up</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until all the people had finished” </span>(II Samuel 15:24), which is taken to mean that he was removed from the High Priesthood since the Divine Spirit had departed from him. 
The Gemara asks: If it is true that the letters of the breastplate protrude or even join together to form the answer, why does the High Priest need the Divine Spirit and Divine Presence to be with him? And if he has the Divine Spirit and Divine Presence with him, why does he need the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span>? The Gemara answers: The Divine Spirit <span class="gemarra-regular">assisted the </span><span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span>. In other words, the letters formed the answer only if the High Priest himself was worthy, but his divine inspiration was not great enough to provide an answer without them.
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the High Priest <span class="gemarra-regular">may be consulted </span>for the decision of the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only on behalf of the king, </span>or on behalf of the president of the court, or on behalf of one whom the community needs. <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters</span> derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he shall stand before Elazar the priest, who shall inquire</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for him by the judgment of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Urim</span> before God; by his mouth they shall go out, and by his mouth they shall come in, both he and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation” (Numbers 27:21). Each phrase describes a different circumstance in which the <span class="it-text">Urim</span> <span class="it-text">VeTummim</span> may be consulted: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He”; this is </span>a reference <span class="gemarra-regular">to a king, </span>as “he” refers to Joshua, who had the status of a king. <span class="gemarra-regular">“All the children </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Israel with him”; this is </span>a reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">priest anointed for war, </span>as all of the Jewish people follow him to war according to his instruction. <span class="gemarra-regular">“Even all</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the congregation”; this is </span>a reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sanhedrin, </span>who are the heads of the Jewish people.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> On <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur, </span>the day on which there is a mitzva by Torah law to afflict oneself, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to engage <span class="gemarra-regular">in eating and in drinking, and in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bathing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and in smearing </span>oil on one’s body, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in wearing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shoes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and in conjugal relations. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">the king, </span>in deference to his eminence, and a new <span class="gemarra-regular">bride </span>within thirty days of her marriage, who wishes to look especially attractive at the beginning of her relationship with her husband, may <span class="gemarra-regular">wash their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">face</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> on Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">A woman after childbirth, </span>who is suffering, may <span class="gemarra-regular">wear shoes </span>because going barefoot causes her pain. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. The Rabbis prohibit </span>these activities for a king, a new bride, and a woman after childbirth.
The mishna elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who eats a large date-bulk</span> of food, equivalent to a date <span class="gemarra-regular">and its pit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or who drinks a cheekful </span>of liquid on Yom Kippur is <span class="gemarra-regular">liabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to receive the punishment of <span class="it-text">karet</span> for failing to fulfill the mitzva to afflict oneself on Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">All foods </span>that one eats <span class="gemarra-regular">join </span>together to constitute <span class="gemarra-regular">a date-bulk; and all liquids </span>that one drinks <span class="gemarra-regular">join</span> together to constitute <span class="gemarra-regular">a cheekful. </span>However, if <span class="gemarra-regular">one eats and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> drinks, </span>the food and beverage <span class="gemarra-regular">do not join </span>together to constitute a measure that determines liability, as each is measured separately. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara expresses surprise at the mishna’s terminology, which states that it is prohibited to eat and drink on Yom Kippur. Why does the mishna use the word <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, </span>which indicates that these activities are only sinful? <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span>is, after all, <span class="gemarra-regular">punishable by </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span> if he eats, and the mishna should have used the more accurate word liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ila said, and some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya said: </span>This term is <span class="gemarra-regular">needed only for a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">half-measure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning that if one eats less than the amount that incurs the punishment of <span class="it-text">karet</span>, he still violates a prohibition. 
The Gemara asks: This explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">works out well according to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a half-measure is prohibited by Torah </span>law even though it does not incur a punishment. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a half-measure is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted by Torah </span>law, and that it is the Sages who prohibit eating less than a full measure, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>about the terminology, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was stated</span> that <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> debated the nature of <span class="gemarra-regular">a half-measure</span> of a forbidden substance? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited by Torah </span>law, and the Torah prohibits even a minute amount of forbidden substance. <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lakish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted by Torah </span>law. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>explanation works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan. However, </span>according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what can be said? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish concedes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a half-measure is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">rabbinic </span>law. If so, Reish Lakish, too, will say that eating or drinking a half-measure is prohibited on Yom Kippur, by rabbinic law.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>if according to Reish Lakish there is a rabbinic prohibition to eat a half-measure, <span class="gemarra-regular">one should not be liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to bring an offering </span>for breaking <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath </span>to eat a half-measure of forbidden foods. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why, </span>then, did we <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>in a mishna otherwise: He who swore the following oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will not eat, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>unslaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">animal carcasses, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reptiles, or creeping </span><span class="gemarra-regular">animals, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to bring an offering for violating his oath. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon exempts </span>him. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we discussed it: Why </span>should he <span class="gemarra-regular">be liable </span>for breaking an oath? <span class="gemarra-regular">He was already sworn and obligated at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Mount Sinai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> along with the rest of the Jewish people, not to eat these things. According to <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, an oath does not take effect if it contradicts a previously existing oath. The second oath to not eat has no effect in terms of eating forbidden foods, so why should one be liable for breaking it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav, and Shmuel, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yoḥanan say </span>with regard to this: Here we are dealing with a case where one <span class="gemarra-regular">includes permitted foods with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forbidden foods. </span>This means that had one sworn only not to eat unslaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">animal carcasses </span>or <span class="it-text">tereifot</span> and then ate them, he would not be liable for breaking the oath because he was already sworn not to eat those foods. However, if one swore not to eat at all, his oath takes effect on permitted foods. Consequently, if he eats any food he is liable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Reish Lakish said: </span>The only application of this mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">you will find is </span>in a case where one <span class="gemarra-regular">explicitly </span>says that he will not eat <span class="gemarra-regular">a half-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">measure, and </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. </span>They say that when one swears that he will not eat, he prohibits himself only from eating a whole measure of food. If he eats a half-measure, he has not violated a prohibition. Therefore, in order for a half-measure to be prohibited, he needs to specify this in his oath. Or, you find it in the case of one who makes <span class="gemarra-regular">no specification </span>at all of a half-measure, 

Daf 74a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: A man prohibits himself from any amount. </span>If a man swears that he will not eat, he thereby prohibits himself from eating even the smallest amount of food. Therefore, Reish Lakish himself maintains that eating a half-measure does not constitute a prohibition.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say: </span>Perhaps Reish Lakish <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>a half-measure <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted by Torah</span> law, despite the fact that it is prohibited by rabbinic law, one is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">bring an offering </span>for violating <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath, </span>then there is the following problem: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t we learn </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">An oath of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">testimon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> where one is sworn to give testimony on something that he saw or knew, <span class="gemarra-regular">applies only to those who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are eligible to give testimony. </span>If one who is ineligible to testify swears an oath to give testimony, the oath is invalid even if he does not testify. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> discussed it: </span>The statement: Those who are eligible to give testimony, comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude what? </span>After all, it was already said that the oath does not apply to women, relatives, and other disqualified people. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>It comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> exclude a king</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> A king is not disqualified from giving testimony, but he does not testify before a court, due to the requirement to give respect to a king.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: </span>It comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude one who plays with dice</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whom the Sages disqualified from giving testimony. <span class="gemarra-regular">But surely one who plays</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with dice is eligible by Torah law </span>to give testimony, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">disqualified him. </span>Despite this, <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath of testimony does not apply to him</span> by Torah law, even though the prohibition on his testifying is rabbinic. 
The Gemara rejects this by distinguishing between the two cases: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> different there, </span>in the case of testimony, where <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> states: “If he does not utter it, </span>then he shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 5:1), i.e., a man who can testify but doesn’t do so should be punished. <span class="gemarra-regular">But this person cannot ever give testimony </span>since the court will not accept his testimony. The Torah makes liability for an oath of testimony contingent on one’s ability to testify. Therefore, an oath of testimony would not apply to someone unable to testify. However, one who takes an oath not to eat is liable if he breaks that oath, notwithstanding the rabbinic prohibition against eating less than a measure of forbidden food. Consequently, this rejection does not stand, and the first explanation remains. 
§ The Gemara’s initial assumption is that the mishna’s use of the word prohibited is referring to a transgression not punishable by <span class="it-text">karet</span>. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And anywhere that it teaches</span> that transgressing is <span class="gemarra-regular">punishable by </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>does it never <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>using the word <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited? Was it not taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Although they said </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited with all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span>five Yom Kippur afflictions, <span class="gemarra-regular">they said </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">punishment of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kare</span><span class="gemarra-italic">t </span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">only to one who eats, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or drinks, or performs </span>prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">labor. </span>This means that the word prohibit is used with transgressions punishable by <span class="it-text">karet</span> as well. The Gemara rejects this. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>what the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: When they said </span>that those five activities are <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, they said that only </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a half-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">measure; but </span>a full <span class="gemarra-regular">measure is punishable by </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">although </span>a violation <span class="gemarra-regular">is punishable by </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is punishable </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only </span>if one <span class="gemarra-regular">eats, or drinks, or performs </span>prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">labor; </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">alone </span>are the cases where <span class="it-text">karet</span> is incurred.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">when it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in the mishna using the language of <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited, </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>transgressions, which do not incur <span class="it-text">karet</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabba and Rav Yosef taught this in other</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> books </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav’s school, </span>i.e., the <span class="it-text">Sifrei</span>, the halakhic midrash on Numbers and Deuteronomy: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to engage <span class="gemarra-regular">in bathing, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in smearing </span>oil on one’s body, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wearing shoes, and in having relations on Yom Kippur? The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse states: “</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbaton</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Leviticus 16:31), meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">resting </span>and refraining from certain activities. Therefore, the word prohibit is used with these activities, but they are not punishable by <span class="it-text">karet</span>. 
§ Apropos the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, the Gemara deals with <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself: </span>What is the law with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">half-measure? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is prohibited by Torah </span>law. <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: It is permitted by Torah </span>law. The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said it is prohibited by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah </span>law <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is fit to combin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> with another half-measure. If one continues to eat more, he will eat a whole measure, which is punishable by Torah law. Therefore, even when he eats the first half-measure <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is eating forbidden </span>food. <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted by Torah </span>law. His reason is as follows: With regard to all forbidden foods, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One states </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Eat,” </span>for example in the verse: “You shall eat neither fat nor blood” (Leviticus 3:17). Eating is defined as consuming a minimum of an olive-bulk, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>prohibition if one eats less than an olive-bulk.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan raised an objection to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish</span> from what was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the prohibition of forbidden fat: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">anything that is included in the punishment </span>of <span class="it-text">karet</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> included in the prohibition. </span>However, one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no prohibition </span>to eat fat of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">koy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a half-measure </span>of forbidden fat, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is no punishment </span>for those. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “All fat” </span>(Leviticus 7:23), indicating that there is a prohibition to eat any kind of fat, including fat of uncertain status and a half-measure of fat. Therefore, a half-measure of fat is prohibited by Torah law. Reish Lakish rejects this argument: This prohibition is <span class="gemarra-regular">rabbinic, and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse </span>brought as a proof is <span class="gemarra-regular">a mere support</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> It cannot be claimed that there is such a prohibition by Torah law. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, it is reasonable </span>to say that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cites only the verse as a support and not as a source to prove the prohibition. <span class="gemarra-regular">For if it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">could enter your mind </span>that this teaching constitutes a prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah law, </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">koy</span> is a wild beast or a domestic animal. Is <span class="gemarra-regular">a verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> necessary to include an uncertainty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> There is no doubt before God and therefore no purpose in writing a case of doubt in the Torah. Consequently, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cites the verse only as a support. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that is the reason, there is no </span>conclusive <span class="gemarra-regular">argument. </span>The Sages of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> might <span class="gemarra-regular">have thought </span>

Daf 74b

that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">koy</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is its own species, </span>and the uncertainty pertains not only to whether it is a wild or domestic animal, but also to whether it even can fit into one of those two categories. <span class="gemarra-regular">For if you do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not say so </span>and maintain that it might be its own species, how can we understand that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Idi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Avin said, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“all” </span>stated in the verse: “All blood you may not eat, whether of birds or of beasts” (Leviticus 7:26), comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">koy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Now, if you say that the <span class="gemarra-italic">koy</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is case of uncertainty, is a verse necessary to include</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an uncertainty? Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">koy</span> is obviously its own <span class="gemarra-regular">species</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">it is different </span>and needs a special verse to include it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>in the case of the forbidden fat, we could say that the <span class="it-text">koy</span> is its own <span class="gemarra-regular">species, </span>and therefore it <span class="gemarra-regular">is different. </span>Consequently, Reish Lakish’s opinion cannot be rejected. 
§ After clarifying the wording of the mishna, the Gemara brings a halakhic midrash to analyze the mishna’s laws. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>The verse states: “And this shall be a statute to you forever: In the seventh month on the tenth day of the month <span class="gemarra-regular">you shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> afflict your souls” </span>(Leviticus 16:29). I <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that one should <span class="gemarra-regular">sit in the su</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cold to suffer </span>and afflict his soul; therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>continuation of <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And you shall not do any</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> labor, </span>the home-born, or the stranger that lives among you” (Leviticus 16:29). This teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">labor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a mitzva that requires one to <span class="gemarra-regular">sit and do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nothing, </span>as one is commanded to refrain from action, <span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> too, affliction </span>of one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">soul is also </span>a mitzva requiring one to <span class="gemarra-regular">sit and do nothing. </span>One is not commanded to be proactive in order to afflict his soul. Rather, one must refrain from specified actions such as eating and drinking. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And say that </span>it means that <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">sits</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the sun and it is </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">hot for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, we do not say to him: Get up and sit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the shade. </span>Or, if one <span class="gemarra-regular">sits in the shade</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and it is </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">cold for him, we do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say to him: Get up and sit in the sun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>These are also cases of affliction involving sitting and doing nothing. The Gemara rejects this: It must be <span class="gemarra-regular">similar </span>to the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">labor. Just as </span>with regard to prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">labor you did not distinguish </span>between situations, since the prohibition is independent of one’s personal circumstance, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do not distinguish </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">affliction, </span>which is not affected by one’s circumstance. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that as the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall afflict your souls” </span>(Leviticus 16:29), I <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">sit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the sun or the cold and be uncomfortable; </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>continuation of <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And you shall not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do any labor” </span>(Leviticus 16:29). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">labor is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> something </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">incurs </span><span class="it-text">karet</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in other circumstances, </span>like Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> too, affliction </span>relates to acts that <span class="gemarra-regular">in other circumstances incur</span> <span class="it-text">karet</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is that </span>circumstance? <span class="gemarra-regular">That is </span>referring to <span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">notar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which lead to <span class="it-text">karet</span> if eaten, and which therefore may not be eaten on Yom Kippur. 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">include </span>the categories of <span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">notar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for which </span>one is punished <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span> if eaten during the year, <span class="gemarra-regular">but I will not include untithed produce, which does not </span>cause one to incur the punishment <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span> if eaten. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “You shall afflict” </span>(Leviticus 16:29), and it also states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall afflict your souls” </span>(Leviticus 16:31). The Torah comes to <span class="gemarra-regular">include </span>another affliction of a serious eating prohibition, i.e. untithed produce. 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will include untithed produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>for which one receives <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>at the hand of Heaven; <span class="gemarra-regular">but I will not include an </span>unslaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">animal carcass, </span>which, although it is prohibited for consumption, one who eats it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>punishable by <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>at the hands of Heaven. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states “you shall afflict” </span>and also <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">and you shall afflict your souls.” </span>The Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">includes </span>foods that are associated with a prohibition even if one who eats them is not punishable by death. 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will include an </span>unslaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">animal carcass,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which </span>is prohibited by <span class="gemarra-regular">a negative mitzva, but I will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not include non-sacred, </span>regular food, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is not </span>prohibited by <span class="gemarra-regular">a negative mitzva. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">“you shall afflict” </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">“and you shall afflict your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">souls.” </span>Although non-sacred food is not prohibited in general, the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">includes </span>it in the prohibition of eating on Yom Kippur.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will include non-sacred food, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which is not </span>associated with any positive mitzva to <span class="gemarra-regular">arise </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">eat, </span>i.e., there is no obligation to eat non-sacred food; <span class="gemarra-regular">but I will not include </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, which</span> one is required to <span class="gemarra-regular">arise </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">eat, </span>as priests are commanded to eat <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states “you shall</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> afflict” </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">“and you shall afflict your souls.” </span>The Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">includes </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> as well in the foods one is prohibited to eat on Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">I will include </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which is not </span>subject to the command: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not leave over” </span>(Leviticus 22:30), since <span class="it-text">teruma</span> need not be consumed within a specific time, <span class="gemarra-regular">but I will not include</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sacred food, </span>which is subject to the command <span class="gemarra-regular">“you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall not leave over”; </span>it is prohibited to leave the meat uneaten after a certain amount of time. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse states “you shall afflict” </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">“and you shall afflict </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your souls,” </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">include </span>the category of sacred food in the prohibition of eating on Yom Kippur. Consequently, the Gemara has demonstrated that it is prohibited to eat any type of food on Yom Kippur.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is your wish to say</span> something to challenge this reasoning, the Gemara brings an additional proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Surely, </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states </span>with regard to one who violates Yom Kippur: <span class="gemarra-regular">“I will destroy that soul </span>from among his people” (Leviticus 23:30). Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">affliction </span>is something <span class="gemarra-regular">that destroys a soul. And what is that? That is </span>refraining from <span class="gemarra-regular">eating and drinking, </span>since someone who does not eat and drink at all will die. The Torah is not referring to other afflictions that do not lead to death. These are the words of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>meant by: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is your wish to say? </span>What flaw did the first proof have? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say the verse is discussing </span>relations with <span class="gemarra-regular">those with whom relations are forbidden, </span>avoidance of which is also called affliction, and it is not discussing eating and drinking, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: I will destroy that soul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">an affliction that can cause death. And what is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that? That is </span>refraining from <span class="gemarra-regular">eating and drinking.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught </span>the following concerning the nature of Yom Kippur: The word <span class="gemarra-regular">affliction is stated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>with regard to Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">affliction </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is stated further on </span>in a different place, concerning the Jews in the desert: “And He afflicted you and caused you to hunger” (Deuteronomy 8:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as further on </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">affliction </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">hunger, so too, here, </span>the meaning of the word <span class="gemarra-regular">affliction </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">hunger. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> let us derive it </span>not from the verse that indicates affliction of hunger but from the verse where Laban warns Jacob: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If you shall afflict my daughters” </span>(Genesis 31:50), which is referring not to hunger but to marital relations. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">We derive affliction </span>commanded to <span class="gemarra-regular">the public</span> on Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">from affliction </span>relating to <span class="gemarra-regular">the public, </span>i.e., the Jewish people in the desert, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not derive affliction </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the public from affliction </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> individual, </span>as in the case of Jacob’s wives. 
The Gemara continues to challenge the view of Rabbi Yishmael: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let us derive </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from affliction</span> stated with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Egypt, as it is written: “And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He saw our affliction” </span>(Deuteronomy 26:7). <span class="gemarra-regular">We say that </span>this verse is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">abstinence from conjugal relations. </span>The Egyptians prevented the Jewish people from having relations. This affliction is an example of public affliction that is not abstention from eating or drinking. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the prohibition to eat or drink on Yom Kippur should not be learned as stated previously, but as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">We derive affliction by the hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of God from affliction by the hand of God, </span>i.e., affliction caused directly by God or through His mitzvot; <span class="gemarra-regular">and we do not derive affliction by the hand of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> God from affliction by the hand of man. </span>
§ Apropos the verse: “And he afflicted you and caused you to hunger, and fed you with manna” (Deuteronomy 8:3), the Gemara expounds related verses. The Torah states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Who feeds you manna in the desert</span> which your fathers did not know, <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to afflict</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you” </span>(Deuteronomy 8:16). What affliction was there in eating the manna? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi </span>disagreed on the matter. <span class="gemarra-regular">One said: There is no comparison between one who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has bread in his basket and one who does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have bread in his basket. </span>The affliction in eating the manna lay in there being no leftover food for the next day. Each day the people worried that they might not have any food to eat the next day. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one said: There is no comparison between one who sees </span>the food <span class="gemarra-regular">and eats </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">see </span>the food <span class="gemarra-regular">and eats </span>it. Though the manna could taste like anything, it always looked the same and did not look as it tasted. Being unable to see the food that they tasted was an affliction. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: From here </span>there is an <span class="gemarra-regular">allusion</span> to the idea <span class="gemarra-regular">that blind </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">eat but are not</span> fully <span class="gemarra-regular">satisfied </span>when they eat because they cannot see their food. Seeing the food contributes to the enjoyment of eating. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Therefore, </span>from what we have just learned, <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who has a meal should eat it only during daytime</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>when there is light to see the food that is being eaten. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: What is the verse </span>that alludes to this? <span class="gemarra-regular">“Better is the seeing of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eye</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> than the wandering of the desire” </span>(Ecclesiastes 6:9). On the same verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: The sight of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a woman is better than the actual act </span>of relations, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Better is the seeing of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eyes than the wandering of the desire.” </span>
§ Apropos the dispute between Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, the Gemara continues with another dispute they had with regard to the correct interpretation of a verse. It is stated: “Do not look upon the wine when it is red, <span class="gemarra-regular">when it gives its color in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the cup, when it glides down smoothly [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bemeisharim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Proverbs 23:31). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi </span>disagreed. <span class="gemarra-regular">One said: Whoever </span><span class="gemarra-regular">casts</span>

Daf 75a

<span class="gemarra-regular">his eye on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his cup, </span>i.e., is habitually drunk, all the prohibitions of <span class="gemarra-regular">those with whom relations are forbidden seem to him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">like level [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mishor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>ground. He is unaware of the pitfalls of sin and continues walking along a twisted and dangerous path. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one said: Whoever casts his eye on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his cup</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the whole world seems to him like </span><span class="gemarra-regular">level [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mishor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Not only is such a person unconcerned by forbidden sexual relations, but all other prohibitions, e.g., monetary prohibitions, also seem permitted in his eyes. 
§ The Gemara explains another verse in Proverbs: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If there is care </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in a man’s heart, let him quash it [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yashḥ</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ena</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Proverbs 12:25). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi </span>dispute the verse’s meaning. <span class="gemarra-regular">One said: He should forcefully push </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yasḥena</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] out of his mind. </span>One who worries should banish his concerns from his thoughts. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>It means <span class="gemarra-regular">he should tell [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yesiḥena</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] others his </span>concerns, which will lower his anxiety.
§ Another verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And dust shall be the serpent’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> food”</span>  (Isaiah 65:25). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi </span>dispute the verse’s meaning. <span class="gemarra-regular">One said: Even if </span>the serpent <span class="gemarra-regular">eats all the delicacies in the world, they will </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">taste like dust. And one said: Even if it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eats all the delicacies in the world, its mind is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unsettled until it </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">eats </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">dust. </span>
With regard to the same topic, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said: Come</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and see that the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be He, is different than the attribute of flesh and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> blood. The attribute of flesh and blood </span>is that one who seeks to <span class="gemarra-regular">provoke another harasses him </span>in all aspects of <span class="gemarra-regular">his life, but the Holy One, Blessed be He</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, does not </span>act in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>way. <span class="gemarra-regular">He cursed the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> serpent </span>and what happened? When <span class="gemarra-regular">the serpent goes up to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the roof its food is with it, </span>and when <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> comes down its food is with it. </span>Consequently, the curse that it suffers does not ruin its life but rather benefits it. 
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">He cursed Canaan </span>that he should be the servant of servants, but he benefits somewhat from this. <span class="gemarra-regular">He eats </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what his master eats, and drinks what his master drinks, </span>and does not worry like a free man does. <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cursed the woman </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone pursues her </span>to marry her. <span class="gemarra-regular">He cursed the land </span>after the sin of Adam and Eve, yet <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone is sustained from it. </span>Even when God is angry, He does not punish His creations severely.
The Gemara cites more verses that pertain to the same issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel </span>disagree with regard to the following verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“We remember the fis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">which we ate in Egypt for nothing” </span>(Numbers 11:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>The verse is referring literally to <span class="gemarra-regular">fish. And one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>The verse is referring to incestuous <span class="gemarra-regular">relations </span>that the Torah had not yet forbidden. The people cried once the Torah prohibited certain relatives to them. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one who said </span>that the verse is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">fish</span> bases him explanation on the verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “which we ate.” </span>This means what they actually ate. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the one who said </span>that the verse is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden sexual relations </span>also bases his explanation on the verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written “for nothing.” </span>Certainly, the people did not actually eat fish for free. 
The Gemara asks: And <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one who said </span>that it is referring to forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">relations, but </span>isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">written “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">which we ate”? </span>The Gemara answers: The Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">employed a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">euphemistic expression. </span>Eating is used as a euphemism for sexual relations, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: </span>“So is the way of an adulterous woman; <span class="gemarra-regular">she eats, and wipes her mouth, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says I have done no wickedness” </span>(Proverbs 30:20). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one who said </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">fish, what </span>is the meaning of the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“for nothing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The people <span class="gemarra-regular">brought the fish from </span>the river, which was <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless property, </span>since the Egyptians obviously would not have given them free food. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said: When the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Jews drew water </span>from the river, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One, Blessed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be He, prepared little fish for them in the water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>They swam <span class="gemarra-regular">into their jugs.</span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the one who said </span>that they cried over actual <span class="gemarra-regular">fish but </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">not promiscuous </span>in having <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden relations </span>in Egypt, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what is written </span>to praise the Jewish people: <span class="gemarra-regular">“A garden enclosed is my sister the bride; </span>a locked fountain, a sealed spring” (Song of Songs 4:12). This figurative language teaches that Jewish women are chaste. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one who said </span>the Jewish people cried over <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden sexual relations, what </span>does the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“a sealed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spring” </span>mean? The Gemara answers: It means that they were <span class="gemarra-regular">not promiscuous </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>relatives <span class="gemarra-regular">who were </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>to them. In Egypt, the Jewish people observed the laws of forbidden sexual relations that are included in the seven Noahide commandments. In the desert, they cried over the additional prohibitions imposed when the Torah was given. 
The Gemara asks further: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, according to the one who said </span>that they cried over the new prohibitions of <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden sexual relations, this is as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written: “And Moses heard the people weeping for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their families” </span>(Numbers 11:10). They cried <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the issue of their families, because </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">it became prohibited </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for them to cohabit with them. But according to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one who says </span>that they cried over <span class="gemarra-regular">fish what </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">“weeping for their families” </span>mean? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Both this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and that happened. </span>They cried about the laws of forbidden sexual relations, and they also cried because they no longer had the fish of Egypt. 
The Gemara returns to the same verse: It states: “We remember…<span class="gemarra-regular">the cucumbers, and the melons, </span>and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic” (Numbers 11:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami and Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Asi </span>debate the verse’s meaning. <span class="gemarra-regular">One said: They tasted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the flavor of all types of food in the manna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>but they cried because <span class="gemarra-regular">they could not taste the tastes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of these five foods </span>that they mentioned. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: They tasted the flavor of all types of food, </span>as well as <span class="gemarra-regular">their textures. </span>The sensation was so strong that it seemed to them like they were eating those very foods. However, with the foods they listed, the people tasted only <span class="gemarra-regular">their flavor but not their texture.</span>
With regard to the manna, the Torah further states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And it was white [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lavan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] like coriande</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seed; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and its flavor </span>was like wafers made of honey” (Exodus 16:31). The Gemara questions this, since coriander is brown, not white. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi said: </span>The manna was <span class="gemarra-regular">round like coriander</span> seed <span class="gemarra-regular">but white like a pearl. This was also </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Coriander [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>is so named <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is similar to flax seeds on their stalks</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which are bound [<span class="it-text">agud</span>] in a bundle. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Others say: </span>It was called <span class="gemarra-regular">coriander [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] because it is similar to a tale [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">haggada</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which draws a person’s heart </span>toward it, just <span class="gemarra-regular">like water, </span>which is essential for life, draws one. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Why is it called <span class="gemarra-italic">gad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Because it told [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">maggid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the Jewish people </span>the answer to issues of uncertainty, such as the paternity of a baby. If a woman remarries within two months after her divorce or the death of her husband and gives birth seven months after her remarriage, it is unclear if the baby gestated for seven months and is the son of the second husband or for nine months and is the son of the first husband. The manna would tell them <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the baby was born after <span class="gemarra-regular">nine </span>months and belongs to the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">or if </span>the baby was born after <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>months and belongs to the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>husband. Since the manna was collected by each family based on the number of its biological members, the manna established the baby’s paternity. 
The manna was called <span class="gemarra-regular">white because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it whitened Israel’s sins. </span>The people feared that if they sinned the manna would not continue to fall. Consequently, they devoted themselves to introspection and repentance. 
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: Just like the prophet would tell the Jewish people </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what was in the holes and what was in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cracks </span>of their souls, highlighting the sins of the people, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, the manna clarified for Israel what was in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the holes and what was in the cracks. How so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Moses for a judgment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one saying: You stole my slave, and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> saying: </span>I did not steal him, rather <span class="gemarra-regular">you sold him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to me, Moses </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say to them: In the morning</span> there will be <span class="gemarra-regular">a judgment. </span>How was the matter resolved? <span class="gemarra-regular">If on the following day </span>the slave <span class="gemarra-regular">found his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">omer</span> of manna <span class="gemarra-regular">in his first master’s house, it would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be clear that he was stolen, </span>because the manna still came to the first owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if on the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> following day he found his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">omer</span> of manna <span class="gemarra-regular">in his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> second master’s house, it would be clear that he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had been sold. </span>
Similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">a man and a woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> came to Moses for a judgment, he saying: She sinned</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> against me, </span>and therefore I may divorce her and am not obligated to pay her divorce settlement, <span class="gemarra-regular">and she saying</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: He sinned against me </span>and therefore I am entitled to the full settlement from the marriage contract, <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to them: In the morning there will be a judgment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. The following day, if her </span><span class="gemarra-italic">omer</span> of manna <span class="gemarra-regular">was found</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in her husband’s house, it would be clear that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> she sinned against him. </span>The fact that her nourishment was given to his household signifies the fact that he has respected her appropriately and is worthy of nourishing her. <span class="gemarra-regular">If her </span><span class="gemarra-italic">omer</span> of manna <span class="gemarra-regular">was found in her father’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s house, it would be clear that he sinned against </span><span class="gemarra-regular">her. </span>Her nourishment has not been given to his household, signifying that he has been disrespectful to her and is not worthy of nourishing her.
§ The Gemara continues to discuss the manna: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is written: “And when the dew</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon it” </span>(Numbers 11:9). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written: “And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the people shall go out and gather </span>a day’s portion every day” (Exodus 16:4). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “The people went about and gathered it” </span>(Numbers 11:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>texts be reconciled? For the <span class="gemarra-regular">righteous, </span>the manna <span class="gemarra-regular">fell at the opening of their homes. </span>They expended no effort at all. The <span class="gemarra-regular">average people went out </span>of the camp <span class="gemarra-regular">and gathered </span>what fell there. <span class="gemarra-regular">The wicked </span>had <span class="gemarra-regular">to go about </span>farther <span class="gemarra-regular">to gather. </span>
With regard to the manna, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written “bread” </span>(Exodus 16:4); <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written “cakes” </span>(Numbers 11:8); <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">written “and ground it </span>in mills,” (Numbers 11:8), implying that it was neither bread nor a cake. <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>texts be reconciled? For the <span class="gemarra-regular">righteous, </span>it fell as baked <span class="gemarra-regular">bread; </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">average people, </span>it fell as unbaked <span class="gemarra-regular">cakes; </span>for the <span class="gemarra-regular">wicked </span>it came in an unprocessed form and consequently they <span class="gemarra-regular">ground it </span>in a mill.
The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Or beat it in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mortar” </span>(Numbers 11:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: This teaches that women’s perfumes fell for the Jewish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> people with the manna </span>because they are <span class="gemarra-regular">an item </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">beaten in a mortar. </span>The verse continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cooked it in a pot” </span>(Numbers 11:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥama said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: This teaches that cooking spices fell for the Jewish people</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with the manna.</span>
§ With regard to donations for the Tabernacle, the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they brought yet to him free-will offerings </span><span class="gemarra-regular">every morning” </span>(Exodus 36:3). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">“every morning”? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan said: </span>They brought donations <span class="gemarra-regular">from that which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fell every morning </span>with the manna. <span class="gemarra-regular">This teaches that pearls</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and precious stones fell for the Israelites with the manna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> It states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the rulers [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nesi’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] brought </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the onyx [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shoham</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] stones” </span>(Exodus 35:27). A <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>that the word <span class="gemarra-italic">nesi’im</span> means <span class="gemarra-regular">actual </span>clouds brought them. <span class="gemarra-regular">As</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it states: “As clouds [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nesi’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] and wind without </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rain </span>so is he that boasts himself of a false gift” (Proverbs 25:14). We learn from this that the precious stones fell from the clouds with the manna.
It was also said with regard to the manna: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And its taste was as the taste </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a cake [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] baked with oil [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hashamen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> (Numbers 11:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu said: </span><span class="it-text">Shad</span> means breast. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as a baby</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tastes different flavors from the breast, </span>since the taste of the milk changes somewhat depending on what foods his mother eats, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too with the manna, every time that the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Jewish people ate </span>the manna, <span class="gemarra-regular">they found in it many</span> different <span class="gemarra-regular">flavors, </span>based on their preferences. <span class="gemarra-regular">There are those who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that the word is written as <span class="it-text">shed</span> and means <span class="gemarra-regular">literally a demon. </span>How so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as a demon changes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into different forms </span>and colors, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, the manna changed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into different flavors. </span>
The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And Moses said: This shall be, when</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Lord will give you in the evening meat to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eat, and in the morning bread to the full” </span>(Exodus 16:8). A <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught in the name of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehoshua ben Korḥa: The meat that the Jewish people asked </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for inappropriately, </span>since they had the manna and did not need meat, was <span class="gemarra-regular">given to them inappropriately, </span>in a way that was unpleasant; they were punished afterward (Rabbeinu Elyakim). 

Daf 75b

However, <span class="gemarra-regular">bread, </span>which is essential, <span class="gemarra-regular">they asked for appropriately. </span>Therefore, it <span class="gemarra-regular">was given to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them appropriately</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in the morning, when there was time to prepare it. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">From here, the Torah </span><span class="gemarra-regular">teaches etiquette, that </span>it is proper <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat meat only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">at night, </span>as Moses said to the children of Israel: “This shall be, when the Lord will give you in the evening meat to eat” (Exodus 16:8). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Abaye say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">someone who has a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">meal should eat it only in the day? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">We mean to say: Like day. </span>It is not necessary to eat the food in the daytime, as long as one can see what he eats. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Aḥa </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Ya’akov said: At the beginning, the Jewish people </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were like chickens pecking at the garbage; </span>any time there was food they grabbed it and ate it, <span class="gemarra-regular">until Moses </span><span class="gemarra-regular">came and set specific times to eat, </span>as the verse implies. He set mealtimes for them in the morning and in the evening. 
It was stated with regard to the quail: <span class="gemarra-regular">“While the meat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was yet between their teeth, </span>before it was chewed, the anger of the Lord was kindled the people” (Numbers 11:33), which means that they died immediately. However, it also states: “You shall not eat it for only one day…but for <span class="gemarra-regular">an entire month </span>until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you” (Numbers 11:19–20). <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>texts be reconciled? <span class="gemarra-regular">The average people died immediately, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">the wicke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">continued</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to suffer </span>in pain <span class="gemarra-regular">for a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> month </span>and then died.
The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And they spread them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vayishteḥu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>out for themselves round about the camp” (Numbers 11:32). <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: Do not read it </span>as <span class="gemarra-italic">vayishteḥu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rather, </span>read it as <span class="gemarra-italic">vayishḥatu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">enemies of the Jewish people, </span>a euphemism for the Jewish people themselves, <span class="gemarra-regular">were liable to </span>receive the punishment of <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughter </span>due to their demand. The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Spread out [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shato’aḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Numbers 11:32). A <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Do not read it </span>as <span class="gemarra-italic">shato’aḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but </span>as <span class="gemarra-italic">sha</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that </span>other food <span class="gemarra-regular">fell for the Jewish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> people </span>along <span class="gemarra-regular">with the manna. </span>The food was something <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> requires ritual slaughtering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sheḥita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>referring to birds. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: And do you learn </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">from here? </span>Do we need to alter the word for this purpose? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t it already stated </span>explicitly: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he rained meat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upon them like dust, and winged birds like the sand </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the seas” </span>(Psalms 78:27)? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it was taught </span>in a related <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Then you shall slaughter </span>of your herd and of your flock which the Lord has given you, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I have commanded you” </span>(Deuteronomy 12:21). <span class="gemarra-regular">This teaches that Moses</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was commanded in </span>the laws of ritual slaughter to cut the <span class="gemarra-regular">gullet and the windpip</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> in the neck. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with a bird </span>one must cut through <span class="gemarra-regular">the majority </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>pipe, <span class="gemarra-regular">and with an animal </span>one must cut through <span class="gemarra-regular">the majority of </span>both pipes. Moses was commanded these laws along with the other details of slaughtering. According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, the word <span class="it-text">shatuaḥ</span> does not teach us about ritual slaughter. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> states: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shatuaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that </span>the manna <span class="gemarra-regular">fell in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">layers [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mashtiḥin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>in a straight row.
With regard to the manna, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written “bread” </span>(Exodus 16:4), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written “oil” </span>(Numbers 11:8), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written “honey” </span>(Exodus 16:31). How can we reconcile these verses? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: For the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> youth </span>it was like <span class="gemarra-regular">bread, for the elderly </span>it was like <span class="gemarra-regular">oil, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">for the children </span>it was like <span class="gemarra-regular">honey</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Each received what was appropriate.
The Gemara comments further: The word quail <span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shlav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with the letter <span class="it-text">shin</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">but we read </span>it as <span class="gemarra-italic">slav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with the letter <span class="it-text">samekh</span>. What does this teach us? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The righteous eat it in peace [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shalva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>based on the written form of the word; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">the wicked eat it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and it seems to them like thorns [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">silvin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>based on the way the word is read. 
Furthermore, with regard to the quail: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said: There are four types</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of quail and these are they: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Sikhli</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kivli</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pasyoni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">slav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. The best </span>tasting <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all </span>is the <span class="gemarra-italic">sikhli</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. The worst of all </span>is the <span class="gemarra-italic">slav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara relates how tasty even the quail was that the Jews ate in the desert: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was</span> as small <span class="gemarra-regular">as a sparrow, and they would place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it in the oven </span>to roast, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it expanded until</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it filled the </span>entire <span class="gemarra-regular">oven. They would place it upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thirteen loaves </span>of bread, and even the <span class="gemarra-regular">last </span>loaf on the bottom <span class="gemarra-regular">could be eaten only </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">mixed with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">other food, </span>due to all the fat it had absorbed from the quail. 
It is told that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda found </span>quail <span class="gemarra-regular">among his barrels of wine, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda found </span>quail <span class="gemarra-regular">among logs of wood </span>in his storeroom. <span class="gemarra-regular">Every day Rava’s sharecropper brought him </span>a quail that he found in his fields. <span class="gemarra-regular">One day, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not bring </span>him one because he failed to find any. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is this, </span>why is today different? <span class="gemarra-regular">He went up to the roof </span>to think about it. <span class="gemarra-regular">He heard a child say </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">When I heard, my innards trembled, </span>my lips quivered at the voice, rottenness enters into my bones, and I tremble where I stand; that I should wait for the day of trouble when he comes up against the people that he invades” (Habakkuk 3:16). Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Learn from this that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda has died. </span>I am therefore not worthy to receive the quail anymore, since it is on <span class="gemarra-regular">account of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the teacher </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the student eats</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> When Rav Ḥisda was alive, Rava received the quail due to Rav Ḥisda’s merit; now that he had died, Rava was not worthy to receive the quail. 
§ Furthermore, with regard to the manna <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when the layer of dew lifted, </span>behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a fine flaky substance, as fine as frost on the ground” (Exodus 16:14), indicating that the dew covered the manna. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written: </span>“<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when the dew fell </span>upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it” (Numbers 11:9), meaning that the manna fell on top of the dew. How can these verses be reconciled? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">dew above and dew below, </span>with the manna in between, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the manna <span class="gemarra-regular">appeared as if </span>it were <span class="gemarra-regular">placed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a box [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kufsa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of dew.
The verse describes the manna as <span class="gemarra-regular">“a fine flaky</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">meḥuspas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>substance” (Exodus 16:14). <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: </span><span class="it-text">Meḥuspas</span> means it was <span class="gemarra-regular">a substance that dissolved [</span><span class="it-text">maḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on the palm [</span><span class="it-text">pas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of the hand. </span>Since it was so fine, it dissolved upon contact. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was a substance that was absorbed in </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">248 limbs, </span>the numerical equivalent of the word <span class="it-text">meḥuspas</span>. The Gemara expresses surprise at this: If one calculates the value of the letters in the word <span class="gemarra-italic">meḥuspas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is more, </span>totaling 256. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Meḥuspas</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written</span> in the Torah without the letter <span class="it-text">vav</span>. Therefore, the total is exactly 248. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>The Torah states: “And He caused manna to rain upon them for food, and He gave them of the grain of heaven. <span class="gemarra-regular">Man did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eat the bread of the mighty [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">abirim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Psalms 78:24–25). “Bread of the mighty” is <span class="gemarra-regular">bread that the ministering angels </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> this is the <span class="gemarra-regular">statement of Rabbi Akiva. When </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these words were said before Rabbi Yishmael, he said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">go and tell Akiva: Akiva you have erred. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Do the ministering angels eat bread? It is already stated </span>about Moses, when he ascended on high: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Bread I did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not eat and water I did not drink” </span>(Deuteronomy 9:9). If even a man who ascends on high does not need to eat, certainly the ministering angels do not need to eat. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, how do I establish </span>the meaning of the word <span class="gemarra-italic">abirim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It can be explained as <span class="gemarra-regular">bread </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that was absorbed into </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">248 limbs [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eivarim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>so that there was no waste. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">how do I establish </span>the verses: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall have a spade among your weapons, </span>and it shall be that when you relieve yourself outside, you shall dig with it, and shall turn back and cover your excrement” (Deuteronomy 23:14) and “You shall have a place also outside the camp <span class="gemarra-regular">where you can relieve yourself </span>” (Deuteronomy 23:13). From here we learn that there was waste in their bowels, as they had to leave the camp to relieve themselves. The Gemara explains: This waste was not a byproduct of the manna; it was from food <span class="gemarra-regular">items </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that the gentile merchants sold them. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar ben Perata</span> disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: The manna caused even items that the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gentile merchants sold them to be </span>completely <span class="gemarra-regular">digested, </span>so that even other food that they ate produced no waste. <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">how do I establish </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall have a spade among your weapons”? After they sinned, </span>the manna was not as effective. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Holy One, Blessed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be He, said: I </span>initially <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they would be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">like ministering angels </span>who do not produce waste; <span class="gemarra-regular">now I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will trouble them to walk three parasangs </span>to leave the camp in order to relieve themselves. 
How do we know that the Israelite camp was three parasangs? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “And they camped </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by the Jordan from Beth-Jeshimoth to Abel-shittim” </span>(Numbers 33:49), <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: I saw that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> site and it was three parasangs </span>in length. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: When </span>the Jews <span class="gemarra-regular">relieved themselves </span>in the desert, <span class="gemarra-regular">they did not relieve </span>themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">ahead of themselves, </span>i.e., in the direction of their travel, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">side </span>of the camp, <span class="gemarra-regular">but behind </span>the camp, in a place that they had already traveled. Consequently, those near the front of the camp had to walk a distance of three parasangs from their homes to leave the camp.
Furthermore, with regard to the manna, the verse states Israel’s complaint: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> now our soul is dry, there is nothing at all</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>we have nothing beside this manna to look to” (Numbers 11:6). <span class="gemarra-regular">They said: This manna will eventually swell in our</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stomachs </span>and kill us; <span class="gemarra-regular">is there </span>anyone <span class="gemarra-regular">born of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> woman who ingests </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">but does not expel </span>waste? This supports the Gemara’s claim that the manna did not create waste.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When these words were said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Yishmael, he said to them: Do not read </span>it as <span class="gemarra-italic">abirim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rather, </span>read it as <span class="gemarra-italic">eivarim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>limbs. The manna was <span class="gemarra-regular">something that was absorbed by 248 limbs. But, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">how do I establish “And you shall have a spade </span><span class="gemarra-regular">among your weapons”? From the </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">items that came to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them from overseas lands. </span>Rabbi Yishmael disagrees with Rabbi Elazar ben Perata with regard to the effect the manna had on the digestion of other foods.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, “Man [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] did eat the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bread of the mighty” </span>(Psalms 78:25); 

Daf 76a

the verse is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua, for whom manna fell corresponding </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the rest of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Jewish people</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> when he waited for Moses at Mount Sinai during the forty days Moses was on the mountain. The verses allude to this: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Man” is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written here, and “man” is written there: “Take to you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Joshua, the son of Nun, a man in whom there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is spirit, </span>and lay your hand upon him” (Numbers 27:18). From here, the Gemara learns that the “man” is Joshua. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that the verse is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses, </span>about whom <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “Now the man Moses</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was very humble” </span>(Numbers 12:3). The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span><span class="gemarra-regular">can learn </span>a verbal analogy to the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“man” from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the word “man,” but we cannot learn </span>a verbal analogy to the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“man” from </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“the man,”</span> which is used to refer to Moses. 
Furthermore, with regard to the manna: The <span class="gemarra-regular">students </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai asked him: Why didn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the manna fall for the Jewish people </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">once a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">yea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> to take care of all their needs, instead of coming down every day? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: I will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> give you a parable: To what does this matter compare</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? To a king of flesh and blood who has </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one son. He granted him </span>an allowance for <span class="gemarra-regular">food once</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a year and </span>the son <span class="gemarra-regular">greeted his father only once</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a year, </span>when it was time for him to receive his allowance. So <span class="gemarra-regular">he arose and granted him his food</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> every day, and </span>his son <span class="gemarra-regular">visited him every day. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">So too, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Jewish people, someone who had four or five</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> children would be worried and say: Perhaps the manna will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not fall tomorrow and we will all die of starvation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Consequently, everyone directed their hearts to their Father in heaven</span> every day. The manna that fell each day was sufficient only for that day, so that all of the Jewish people would pray to God for food for the next day. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>they received manna daily <span class="gemarra-regular">so that they would </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">eat it while it was hot </span>and fresh. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>they received manna daily <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the hardship of <span class="gemarra-regular">carrying on the journey. </span>They did not stay in the same place all those years, and it would have been difficult for them to carry the manna from one place to another. Therefore, the manna fell wherever they went. 
§ It is told: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon, and Rabbi Yishmael, and the Elders were sitting </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and discussing the passage about the manna and Rabbi Elazar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">HaModa’i was sitting among them. Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> responded and said: The manna that fell for the Jewish</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> people was sixty cubits high. Rabbi Tarfon said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Moda’i, how long will you collect words and bring</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon us </span>teachings that have no basis?
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: Rabbi, I am interpreting </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a verse. </span>How so? It states about the Flood: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Fifteen</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cubits above did the waters prevail; and the mountains were</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> covered” </span>(Genesis 7:20). <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it possible that it would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be fifteen cubits </span>high <span class="gemarra-regular">from a valley, fifteen </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the plain, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">fifteen </span>cubits <span class="gemarra-regular">from the mountains? Did the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">water stand as though in layers, </span>conforming to the height of the land below it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Furthermore, how could the Ark</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> travel </span>over water that was at different levels? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather: “On</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the same day were all the fountains of the great</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> deep broken up” </span>(Genesis 7:11), <span class="gemarra-regular">until the water </span>rose and <span class="gemarra-regular">was level with the mountains. Afterward, </span>the verse states that <span class="gemarra-regular">“fifteen cubits above did the waters prevail.”</span>
Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">But which attribute is greater, the attribute of goodness or </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the attribute of retribution? One must say the attribute of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">goodness </span>is greater <span class="gemarra-regular">than the attribute of retribution</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> With </span><span class="gemarra-regular">regard to the attribute of retribution, </span>in the case of the Flood, the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “And the windows of heaven </span><span class="gemarra-regular">were opened” </span>(Genesis 7:11), which indicates that there were only windows. Whereas, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the attribute of goodness, </span>in the case of the manna, the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “He commanded</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rained down manna upon them to eat and gave them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> heavenly grain” </span>(Psalms 78:23–24). 
Based on this, the Gemara calculates: The area of <span class="gemarra-regular">how many windows are in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">door? Four. </span>A door is equivalent to four windows in size. One adds another <span class="gemarra-regular">four </span>for the second door, as the verse uses the plural “doors,” which implies that there were two doors. <span class="gemarra-regular">This equals </span>the area of <span class="gemarra-regular">eight </span>windows. If the depth of water in the Flood is based on the phrase “windows of heaven,” implying two windows, then the manna fell at a rate four times that of the water of the Flood. Since the water of the Flood reached a depth of fifteen cubits, <span class="gemarra-regular">it turns out </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that the manna that fell for the Jewish people was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sixty cubits high, </span>i.e., four times as high.
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Isi ben Yehuda said: The manna that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fell for the Jewish people would accumulate and ascend until </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all the kings of the East and West could see </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it, as it is stated: “You prepared a table before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me in the presence of my enemies; you anointed my </span><span class="gemarra-regular">head with oil; my cup runs over” </span>(Psalms 23:5). God prepared food for the Jewish people, so that their enemies would see their greatness over the world. <span class="gemarra-regular">“My cup </span><span class="gemarra-regular">runs over [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">revaya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]”</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abaye said: We learn from this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that the cup of David in the next world holds </span><span class="gemarra-regular">221 </span><span class="gemarra-italic">log</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, since it is stated: “My cup runs over,” </span>and the word <span class="gemarra-italic">revaya</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has that numerical value.</span>
The Gemara asks how Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i can compare the depth of the Flood waters with the amount of manna that fell in the desert: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is not similar, </span>and the calculation is inaccurate. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the case of the Flood, the water rose fifteen cubits in <span class="gemarra-regular">forty days; </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of the manna, it took only <span class="gemarra-regular">one hour </span>every day to fall. Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>the Flood was <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">everyone </span>and covered the whole world; whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>the manna <span class="gemarra-regular">was for the Jewish people alone. And there </span>would be <span class="gemarra-regular">much more </span>manna <span class="gemarra-regular">for them </span>than sixty cubits, which is the measurement put forth by Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Elazar HaModa’i derived “opening” </span>in the verse: “He commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven” (Psalms 78:23), from <span class="gemarra-regular">“opening” </span>in the verse: “And the windows of heaven were opened” (Genesis 7:11). He used a verbal analogy that teaches that the skies opened in both instances in the same way.
§ The mishna taught that as per the five prohibited activities on Yom Kippur it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to engage <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eating </span>and in drinking, and in bathing, and in smearing the body with oil, and in wearing shoes, and in conjugal relations. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">These five afflictions </span>of Yom Kippur, to <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>do they <span class="gemarra-regular">correspond? </span>Where is the Torah source or allusion to them? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span>They are based on <span class="gemarra-regular">the five </span>times that the <span class="gemarra-regular">afflictions </span>of Yom Kippur are mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Torah. </span>It is stated: (1) <span class="gemarra-regular">“And</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on the tenth </span>of this seventh month you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall afflict your souls” (Numbers 29:7); (2) <span class="gemarra-regular">“But on the tent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> of this seventh month is the day of atonement, it shall be a holy convocation for you and you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 23:27); (3) “It shall be for you <span class="gemarra-regular">a Shabbat of solemn rest, </span>and you shall afflict your souls (Leviticus 23:32); (4) <span class="gemarra-regular">“It is a Shabbat of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> solemn rest [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shabbaton</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>for you, and you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 16:31); (5) <span class="gemarra-regular">“And it shall be </span>a statute <span class="gemarra-regular">for you </span>forever, in the seventh month on the tenth of the month, you shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 16:29).
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are these five </span>the only afflictions? <span class="gemarra-regular">We</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learn </span>in the mishna that there are <span class="gemarra-regular">six</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> Eating, drinking, bathing, smearing oil, conjugal relations, and wearing shoes. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Drinking is included in </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">eating</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>both together are considered a single affliction. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Reish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lakish said: From where do we derive that drinking is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">included in </span>the concept of <span class="gemarra-regular">eating? As it is stated: “</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And you shall eat before the Lord your God, </span>in the place where He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, <span class="gemarra-regular">the tithe of your grain, </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> wine [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tirosh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], and </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">your oil” </span>(Deuteronomy 14:23). <span class="gemarra-italic">Tirosh</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is wine, </span>yet the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">calls </span>the drinking of wine eating with the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“and you shall eat,” </span>meaning that eating also refers to drinking. 
The Gemara rejects this answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do you draw this conclusion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">was eaten as </span><span class="gemarra-italic">anigron</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a sauce made of oil, beet juice, and garum mixed with wine. As <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Shmuel said: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Anigron</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">beet juice </span>and wine mixed together. <span class="gemarra-italic">Akhsigro</span><span class="gemarra-italic">n</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that comes from boiled vegetables </span>that have wine mixed into them. The vegetables are mixed with the wine and eaten. It is possible for wine to literally be eaten. Therefore, the verse does not prove that drinking is included in eating.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Aḥa bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ya’akov said: From here </span>there is a proof as the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall spend that money on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all that your soul desires, on oxen, or on sheep</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, or on wine, or on strong drink [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sheikhar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>or whatever your soul desires, and you shall eat” (Deuteronomy 14:26). <span class="gemarra-regular">Strong drink is a drink, but the Merciful One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">calls </span>its consumption eating, in the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“and you shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eat.” </span>
The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>do you draw this conclusion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps here too it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was eaten as </span><span class="gemarra-italic">anigron</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Gemara rejects this: Here that answer is insufficient because the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">writes “strong drink [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sheikhar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">something </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">intoxicates. </span>Beverages that generally intoxicate do not do so when they are in a mixture. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span><span class="it-text">sheikhar</span> does not refer to wine but to a food that causes intoxication, such as <span class="gemarra-regular">a sweet dried </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fig from Keilah. As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: A priest who <span class="gemarra-regular">ate a sweet dried fig from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Keilah or drank honey or milk, </span>thereby becoming intoxicated, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">entered the Temple </span>to serve

Daf 76b

<span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>for violating the prohibition: “Drink no wine nor strong drink [<span class="it-text">sheikhar</span>]” (Leviticus 10:9). Consequently, the term <span class="it-text">sheikhar</span> in the text can be understood here as the sweet dried fig. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Gemara rejects this and states: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is derived </span>through a verbal analogy of <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sheikhar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sheikhar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>stated in the verses <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">nazirite </span>(Numbers 6:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>in the case of the nazirite, <span class="it-text">sheikhar</span> means strong <span class="gemarra-regular">wine, so too, here, </span>it means strong <span class="gemarra-regular">wine </span>and not sweet dried figs.
The Gemara returns to the meaning of the word <span class="it-text">tirosh</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tiros</span><span class="gemarra-italic">h</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">wine? Isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">vows </span>not to benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tiros</span><span class="gemarra-italic">h</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is not allowed sweet foods, </span>e.g., sweet fruits, <span class="gemarra-regular">but is allowed wine. </span>Therefore, <span class="it-text">tirosh</span> is not wine but sweet food. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is </span><span class="it-text">tirosh</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wine? But isn’t it written: “</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Tirosh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall make the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">young women flourish [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yenovev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Zechariah 9:17). The word <span class="it-text">yenovev</span> comes from the word <span class="it-text">niv</span>, speech. Consequently, <span class="it-text">tirosh</span> is a food that tempts the heart and mouth of the drinker, even of virgins, who are modest and reticent. Since sweet foods do not have this effect, <span class="it-text">tirosh</span> must be wine. The Gemara replies: This is not a proof, since we could explain it otherwise: <span class="gemarra-regular">Something that comes from </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tirosh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>such as wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">causes virgins to come forth; </span><span class="it-text">tirosh</span> itself means sweet grapes. Perhaps wine is called <span class="it-text">tirosh</span> only by extension because it is made from <span class="it-text">tirosh</span>.
The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it written: “And your vats shall overflow with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tirosh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Proverbs 3:10). This description implies that <span class="it-text">tirosh</span> is wine rather than sweet grapes. The Gemara answers: This too is not a proof that <span class="it-text">tirosh</span> means wine. We could say that <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> vats shall burst with something that comes from </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tirosh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., wine; yet <span class="it-text">tirosh</span> itself means sweet fruits.
The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">But it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “Harlotry, and wine, and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tiros</span><span class="gemarra-italic">h</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">take away the heart” </span>(Hosea 4:11). Since <span class="it-text">tirosh</span> leads the heart astray, it is clear that it is wine. Therefore, the Gemara accepts that <span class="it-text">tirosh</span> means wine. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, according to everyone, </span>the word <span class="gemarra-italic">tirosh</span> in the Bible refers to <span class="gemarra-regular">wine, but vows follow colloquial</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> language</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> During the time of the Mishna, <span class="it-text">tirosh</span> meant sweet fruits; the term included grapes but not wine. When dealing with vows, the intention of the speaker is what must be determined, but no inference can be drawn from colloquial language to the biblical definition of the word. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">why does </span>the Bible <span class="gemarra-regular">call </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">wine </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">why does it call it </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tirosh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Wine” </span>suggests <span class="gemarra-regular">that it brings lamen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the world </span>because drunkenness causes most sins. There is a phonetic resemblance between the <span class="it-text">yayin</span>, wine, and <span class="it-text">ta’aniya</span> <span class="it-text">va’</span><span class="it-text">aniya</span>, sorrow and howling, which Rashi (on Job 2:5) explains as lament. <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Tirosh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>shows <span class="gemarra-regular">that those who indulge in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it become poor [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">rash</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana </span><span class="gemarra-regular">raised a contradiction: It is written </span>as <span class="gemarra-italic">tirash</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">read it </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tirosh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This should be understood as follows: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one merits </span>and drinks appropriately, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is made a head</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">rosh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]; </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not merit </span>and does not drink appropriately, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is made poor [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">rash</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the same as </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>said, as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">raised a contradiction: It is written: </span>“And wine that <span class="gemarra-regular">makes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> glad [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yishamaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>the heart of man” (Psalms 104:15) with a <span class="it-text">shin</span>, but <span class="gemarra-regular">we read it </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yisama</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥ</span> with a <span class="it-text">sin</span>. This teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">If one merits, </span>wine <span class="gemarra-regular">makes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him happy [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">same’aḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]; if one does not merit, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">makes him confounded [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shamem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. This is </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">what Rava said: Wine and good scents make me wise, </span>meaning that wine benefits one who deserves it. 
§ The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do we </span>derive that abstaining from <span class="gemarra-regular">bathing and smearing </span>oil on oneself <span class="gemarra-regular">is called affliction? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written “I ate no pleasant bread, neither did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">meat nor wine enter my mouth, neither did I anoint </span><span class="gemarra-regular">myself at all” </span>(Daniel 10:3). The Gemara explains the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">“I ate no pleasant </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bread”</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: He did not eat even bread </span>made from <span class="gemarra-regular">refined </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wheat; </span>he ate only wheat mixed with bran. 
The Gemara continues to show that abstaining from smearing oil on oneself is considered an affliction: <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where do we </span>derive that abstaining from the activities that Daniel describes is <span class="gemarra-regular">considered affliction? As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “Then he said to me: Fear not, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Daniel, for from the first day that you set your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">heart to understand and to afflict yourself before your God, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your words were heard, and I have come due to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your words” </span>(Daniel 10:12). <span class="gemarra-regular">“For you are greatly loved” </span>(Daniel 9:23).
<span class="gemarra-regular">We have found </span>proof that abstaining from <span class="gemarra-regular">smearing </span>oil on oneself is considered affliction; <span class="gemarra-regular">from where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do we </span>derive that abstaining from <span class="gemarra-regular">bathing </span>is also called affliction? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zutra, son of Rabbi Toviya, said: The verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> states: “And it came into his innards like water, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like oil into his bones” </span>(Psalms 109:18). This means that the water with which one bathes and the oil with which one smears himself are absorbed into the body. Just as abstaining from smearing oil is considered an affliction, so too, abstaining from bathing is considered an affliction. The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">But say </span>that “came into his innards like water” is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">drinking </span>rather than smearing oil. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is similar </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">oil. Just as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">oil </span>described in the verse is smeared <span class="gemarra-regular">from outside </span>the body and not drunk, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span>mentioned in the verse is used for bathing <span class="gemarra-regular">from the outside. </span>It is not drunk.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> took </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">opposite </span>meaning, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do we derive that smearing </span>oil <span class="gemarra-regular">is like drinking on Yom Kippur? Although there is no </span>explicit <span class="gemarra-regular">proof of the matter </span>from the Bible, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an allusion to the matte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> from the verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated: “And it came into his innards like </span><span class="gemarra-regular">water, and like oil into his bones” </span>(Psalms 109:18), meaning that oil on the body is like water within it. Therefore, the phrase “and it came into his innards like water” is referring to the act of drinking water. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Rav Ashi said: Bathing is derived from the same verse</span> cited above, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “Neither did I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">anoint myself at all” </span>(Daniel 10:3). This teaches that Daniel did not do any anointing, including bathing. Consequently, the same source prohibits both of these activities. 
Apropos the verses from Daniel, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>did the angel mean when he said to Daniel: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And I have come due </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to your words” </span>(Daniel 10:12)? From this, it seems that the angel was able to come only because of Daniel. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is as it is written: “And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there stood before them seventy men of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elders</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the house of Israel, and Jaazaniah, son of Shapha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">standing in the midst of them, each man with his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">censer in his hand, and a thick cloud of incense </span><span class="gemarra-regular">went up” </span>(Ezekiel 8:11). Ezekiel saw the Elders of the house of Israel worshipping foreign gods. <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the form </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a hand was put forth, and I was taken </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by a lock of my head; and a spirit lifted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">door of the gate of the inner court that faces </span><span class="gemarra-regular">northward where</span>

Daf 77a

<span class="gemarra-regular">there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> jealousy” </span>(Ezekiel 8:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he brought me into the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inner court of the Lord’s House, and behold at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the opening of the Entrance Hall </span>of the Sanctuary <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> God, between the porch and the altar were about twenty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-five men with their backs toward the Temple of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lord, and their faces toward the east, and they worshipped</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the sun toward the east” </span>(Ezekiel 8:16). The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">From the fact that it is stated “and their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">faces toward the east,” is it not clear that their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">backs were to the Sanctuary, </span>which is in the west? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states “their </span><span class="gemarra-regular">backs toward the Temple of the Lord”? This teaches that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they would uncover </span>themselves <span class="gemarra-regular">and defecate downward, </span>toward the Divine Presence. The verse used a euphemism to refrain from vulgar language.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Holy One, Blessed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be He, said to Michael, </span>the ministering angel of the Jewish people: <span class="gemarra-regular">Michael, your nation has sinned </span>(see Daniel 10:21). <span class="gemarra-regular">He replied: Master of the Universe, </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">it be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> enough for the good </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">among them </span>to save them from destruction. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: I will burn the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the good among them </span>because the good do not rebuke the wicked. <span class="gemarra-regular">Immediately, </span>God spoke to Gabriel: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">He spoke to the man clothed in line</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Go in between the wheelwork and beneath the cherub, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fill your hands with coals of fire from between the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cherubs, and scatter them over the city; and he came</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before my eyes” </span>(Ezekiel 10:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">Immediately: “And the cherub </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stretched out his hand from between the cherubs into the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fire that was between the cherubs, and took and put </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it into the hands of him that was clothed in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">linen, who took it and went out” </span>(Ezekiel 10:7). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥana bar Bizna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida said: If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it were not for the fact that the embers cooled</span> as they were passed <span class="gemarra-regular">from the hand of the cherub</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the hand of Gabriel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> instead of Gabriel taking the embers directly himself as he had been told, <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a remnant or a refugee of the enemies of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Jewish people, </span>a euphemism for the Jewish people themselves, <span class="gemarra-regular">would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have survived. </span>The cooling of the embers limited the punishment. 
The Gemara continues. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “And behold, the man clothed in linen with the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> slate by his side, reported the matter saying: I have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> done as You have commanded me” </span>(Ezekiel 9:11). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan said: At that moment, they cast out Gabriel from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">behind the curtain [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pargod</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where the inner angels reside, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they struck him with sixty blows [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pulsei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fire. They said to him: If you did not do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it, you did not do it; if you did do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it, why did you not do it according to what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you were commanded </span>but deviated from what you were instructed to do? <span class="gemarra-regular">Moreover, </span>after <span class="gemarra-regular">you already did it, do you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not have </span>knowledge of the principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">One should not deliver </span>a report <span class="gemarra-regular">about destruction</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> If one is sent on a mission of destruction, he should not deliver a detailed report of its success but should only hint at it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">They </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">brought Dubiel, the ministering </span><span class="gemarra-regular">angel of the Persian</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and put him in the place</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">baḥarikei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> Gabriel <span class="gemarra-regular">and he served for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-one days. As it is written: “But the prince </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the kingdom of Persia stood opposed to me for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-one days, but, lo, Michael, one of the chief </span><span class="gemarra-regular">princes, came to help me and I remained there beside </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the kings of Persia” </span>(Daniel 10:13). Corresponding to those twenty-one days, <span class="gemarra-regular">they gave him, </span>the ministering angel of Persia, <span class="gemarra-regular">twenty-one kings </span>who ruled and <span class="gemarra-regular">the seaport </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Mashhig</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The ministering angel of the Persians <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Write for me that the Jews </span>must pay <span class="gemarra-regular">taxes [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">akarga</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> to the Persians. <span class="gemarra-regular">They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wrote it for him </span>as he asked. He said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Write </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for me that the Sages </span>must pay <span class="gemarra-regular">taxes. They wrote </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">for him. When they wanted to sign </span>the documents, <span class="gemarra-regular">Gabriel stood from behind the curtain and said: “It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is vain for you who rise early who sit up </span><span class="gemarra-regular">late to eat the bread of sorrow, for He gives </span><span class="gemarra-regular">His beloved sleep” </span>(Psalms 127:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">“for He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gives His beloved sleep” </span>mean? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yitzḥak said: These are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the wives of Torah scholars who disturb </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">sleep in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this world </span>by staying up waiting for their husbands, who rise early and return late from learning Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">merit the World-to-Come. </span>Gabriel asked: Is this the reward they deserve, to pay more taxes? <span class="gemarra-regular">They did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not listen to </span>Gabriel. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said before Him: Master of the Universe, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if all the wise men of other nations were placed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on one side of the scale, and Daniel the beloved </span><span class="gemarra-regular">man were on the other side, would he not outweigh </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them? The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Who is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the one who teaches the virtue of My children? They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to Him: Master of the Universe, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">Gabriel. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: Let him come </span>from behind the partition, as it <span class="gemarra-regular">is stated: “And I have come due </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to your words” </span>(Daniel 10:12), meaning that Gabriel was permitted to enter from behind the partition because he mentioned Daniel’s name. <span class="gemarra-regular">God </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to the other angels: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him ascend. They brought him up. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">He came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">found Dubiel </span>the ministering angel of the Persians <span class="gemarra-regular">holding the letter in his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hand. </span>Gabriel <span class="gemarra-regular">wanted to take </span>the letter <span class="gemarra-regular">from him, </span>but Dubiel <span class="gemarra-regular">swallowed it. Some say the letter was written, but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was not signed. Some say it was also signed, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">when he swallowed it, </span>the signature <span class="gemarra-regular">was erased. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>why, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the kingdom of Persia</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who pay taxes and there are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who do not pay taxes, </span>as the decree was not finalized. It also states there: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And when I depart </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from him, the prince of Greece comes” </span>(Daniel 10:20). Gabriel <span class="gemarra-regular">screamed and screamed </span>that the kings of Greece should not rule over the Jews, <span class="gemarra-regular">but no one listened to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
§ The Gemara returns to the issue of whether refraining from bathing is considered affliction. <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>instead: The fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that bathing is considered affliction, from where do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>derive this? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “And to Ebiathar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the priest the king said: Get to Anatoth to your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fields, for you are deserving of death. But I will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not put you to death today, because you carried the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ark of the Lord God before David my father, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because you have been afflicted in all that my father</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was afflicted” </span>(I Kings 2:26). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to David: “For they said the people is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hungry, and weary, and thirsty in the wilderness” </span>(II Samuel 17:29). <span class="gemarra-regular">Hunger </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>lack of <span class="gemarra-regular">bread </span>to eat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thirst </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>lack of <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span>to drink. The word <span class="gemarra-regular">weary </span>means lack <span class="gemarra-regular">from what? Is it not from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bathing? </span>The comparison of the verses suggests that that too is affliction. The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">And perhaps </span>“weary” means from lack of <span class="gemarra-regular">wearing shoes? </span>Therefore, this does not teach us that refraining from bathing is considered an affliction.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>another source needs to be found. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yitzḥak said: </span>It can be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: “As cold water on a weary soul, </span>so is good news from a far country” (Proverbs 25:25). This implies that the word weary is used to describe someone who has not bathed. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But perhaps</span> the verse is referring to weariness <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>not <span class="gemarra-regular">drinking? </span>The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it written: As cold water </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in a weary soul? </span>That would mean that it entered one like a drink. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">“on a weary soul” is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written, </span>which implies bathing. 
§ The Gemara clarifies the next point in the mishna: The fact that not <span class="gemarra-regular">wearing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shoes </span>is considered an affliction, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where do we </span>derive this? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “And David went up by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the ascent of the Mount of Olives, and wept as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he went up, and he had his head covered, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was walking barefoot” </span>(II Samuel 15:30). <span class="gemarra-regular">Barefoot </span>implies a lack <span class="gemarra-regular">of what? Is it not </span>a lack <span class="gemarra-regular">of wearing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shoes? </span>All these deprivations are described as affliction. The Gemara rejects this: No, <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>he was barefoot <span class="gemarra-regular">from a horse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and whip. </span>Even if he was wearing shoes, a king without a horse and whip was considered as if he were going barefoot. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>We learn it <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>as it states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Go and loose </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the sackcloth from your loins, and remove your shoe from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your foot” </span>(Isaiah 20:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written: “And he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did so, walking naked and barefoot” </span>(Isaiah 20:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">Barefoot </span>implies a lack <span class="gemarra-regular">of what? Is it not </span>a lack of <span class="gemarra-regular">wearing shoes? </span>The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">And say </span>that perhaps the meaning of barefoot is that Isaiah walked <span class="gemarra-regular">with patched </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shoes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Because if you do not say this, </span>but you claim that the verse is to be understood literally, does “naked” mean <span class="gemarra-regular">actually naked? Rather, </span>the meaning is that Isaiah walked in <span class="gemarra-regular">ragged garments. Here too, </span>the meaning is that he walked <span class="gemarra-regular">in patched shoes.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>a different source must be found. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Yitzḥak said </span>that we derive it <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: </span>It states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Withhold your foot from being barefoot, and your throat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from thirst” </span>(Jeremiah 2:25), meaning: <span class="gemarra-regular">Keep yourself from sin, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so that your feet will not come to be barefoot;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> keep your tongue from idle talk, so that your throat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will not come to be thirsty. </span>Consequently, we learn that being barefoot is considered an affliction.
§ The Gemara continues to clarify another of the afflictions of Yom Kippur: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do we </span>derive the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that refraining from <span class="gemarra-regular">conjugal relations is called </span><span class="gemarra-regular">affliction? As it is written, </span>Laban said to Jacob: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you shall afflict my daughters, and if you shall take</span> other<span class="gemarra-regular"> wives </span>beside my daughters” (Genesis 31:50). 

Daf 77b

This can be explained as: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If you shall afflict </span>my daughters” by refraining <span class="gemarra-regular">from conjugal relations, “and if you shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>other wives” causing them to suffer <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">rival</span> wives. The Gemara objects: <span class="gemarra-regular">And say that this </span>phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>phrase are both referring to taking <span class="gemarra-regular">rival </span>wives. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it written: If you take? “And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if you shall take” is written. </span>Therefore, the clauses must be referring to two different kinds of affliction. 
The Gemara challenges further: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say that this </span>phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">are referring to </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">rival </span>wives. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>phrase is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>wives’ current <span class="gemarra-regular">rivals. </span>“If you shall afflict” means that Jacob should not elevate the position of the two maidservants, Bilhah and Zilpah, to the status of wife, which would make them co-wives with Laban’s daughters. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one </span>phrase is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">rivals who </span>might <span class="gemarra-regular">come to him from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the world </span>at large, which would be <span class="gemarra-regular">similar </span>in meaning to <span class="gemarra-regular">“if you shall take.” </span>The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it written: If you take and if you afflict</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It is logical to first state the more severe warning and then the less severe one. But according to this proposed reading that “take” refers to rivals from the world at large and “afflict” refers to elevating the status of maidservants, the text would have first mentioned the less painful affliction of elevating the maidservants and then followed it with a warning about taking new rival wives, as <span class="gemarra-regular">“if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you shall afflict and if you shall take” is written.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to Abaye: But conjugal relations themselves are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">called affliction</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is written: </span>“And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; and he took her, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he lay with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">her and afflicted her” </span>(Genesis 34:2). If so, how can it be said that the affliction is in withholding conjugal relations? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: There, </span>Shechem <span class="gemarra-regular">afflicted her from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> different relations, </span>meaning he slept with her in an unnatural way. That type of relations is clearly an affliction. 
§ The Gemara clarifies some of the prohibitions relating to Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: It is prohibited </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to bath</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> part of the body </span>just as it is prohibited to bathe <span class="gemarra-regular">the whole body. But if one is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dirty from mud or excrement, he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">bathe in his</span> usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner, and he </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">not be concerned </span>about transgressing, since his goal is not pleasure. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is prohibited</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>smear oil on <span class="gemarra-regular">part of the body just </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it is prohibited to smear oil on <span class="gemarra-regular">the whole </span><span class="gemarra-regular">body. But if one was sick </span>and needed to smear oil on his body for medicinal purposes, <span class="gemarra-regular">or if one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">had scabs on his head </span>that would hurt if he did not smear oil on himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">smear </span>oil <span class="gemarra-regular">in his </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner, and he </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">not be concerned </span>about transgressing. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Menashe taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: A woman </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">rinse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one hand in water, </span>so that she does not touch food before she has washed her hands in the morning, <span class="gemarra-regular">and give bread to her child</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and she </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">not be concerned </span>about violating the prohibition of bathing on Yom Kippur. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">They said about Shammai the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elder that he did not want to fee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> his children <span class="gemarra-regular">with one hand, </span>to avoid having to wash it. This prevented the children from eating during all of Yom Kippur. Due to concerns about the health and the suffering of his children, <span class="gemarra-regular">they decreed that he must feed </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two hands, </span>forcing him to wash both hands. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the reason </span>that they also said in general that one must wash his hands before touching food? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Due</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>an evil spirit named <span class="gemarra-regular">Shivta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who resides on hands that have not been washed in the morning.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: One who goes to greet his father </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or his teacher, or to greet one who is greater </span><span class="gemarra-regular">than him </span>in wisdom, and has to cross a river on the way, may <span class="gemarra-regular">cross </span>the water <span class="gemarra-regular">until his neck </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is in the water, and he </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">not be concerne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that he is violating the prohibition against bathing on Yom Kippur.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before them, </span>i.e., the students discussing this question: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span> is the law concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a teacher </span>going <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>visit his <span class="gemarra-regular">student</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> May he enter the water in order to teach his student? The Gemara tries to bring a proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>from what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yitzḥak bar bar Ḥana</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: I saw Ze’iri, who went </span>through a river on his way <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi, his student</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rav Ashi said: </span>This was not the case. Rather, in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, it was the student <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who went to Ze’iri, his teacher. </span>Therefore, this incident does not answer the question. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava permitted those </span>who lived on the <span class="gemarra-regular">right</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> side </span>of the Euphrates <span class="gemarra-regular">to pass through the water to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> guard the frui</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in their fields on Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to Rava: </span>A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught that supports </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your </span>opinion. We learned: <span class="gemarra-regular">Guards of fruit </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">cross </span>the river <span class="gemarra-regular">until their necks are in the water, and they</span> need <span class="gemarra-regular">not be concerned </span>that they are violating the prohibition against bathing on Yom Kippur. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef permitted </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">people</span> of the village of <span class="gemarra-regular">Bei Tarbu to cross in the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> water to come to the lecture </span>he delivered <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">He did not, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">permit them to go </span>back home through the water. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so, you are obstructing them </span>from coming <span class="gemarra-regular">in the future. </span>They will not come to the lecture knowing they will be prohibited from returning home. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>the incident happened differently: Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted them to come and permitted them </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to go </span>back through the water. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>you allow them <span class="gemarra-regular">to come, that is well. But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>you allow them <span class="gemarra-regular">to go </span>back? He said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">So as not to obstruct them </span>from coming <span class="gemarra-regular">in the future. </span>
It is told: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda and Rav Shmuel bar Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda were standing on the bank of the Pappa River </span><span class="gemarra-regular">next to the Ḥatzdad crossing, and Rami bar Pappa was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">standing on the other side </span>of the river. <span class="gemarra-regular">He raised</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his voice to them </span>and asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the ruling with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">crossing over to come to you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to ask a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rav Yehuda said to him: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel who both say: One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">cross </span>in the water, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that he does not remove his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hand from under the hem of his cloak</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> One may not raise the hems of his cloak to his shoulders to keep them dry, since this form of carrying renders one liable to bring a sin-offering. Rather, one should walk normally and get his clothes wet in the water. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>this is not how the incident happened. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yehuda said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: One may <span class="gemarra-regular">cross over, provided</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not remove his hand from the hem</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of his cloak. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef strongly objects to this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: And on a weekday is it permitted </span>to walk <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> such </span>deep water that it presents a danger of drowning? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it written </span>with regard to the river that, in the future, will issue forth from the Holy of Holies: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He measured a thousand cubits, and he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">led me through the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; the water was ankle deep” </span>(Ezekiel 47:3); from <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>it is derived that one <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted to pass through </span>water that reaches <span class="gemarra-regular">up to the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ankles. </span>
Rav Yosef continues explaining the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Again he measured a thousand and he led</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> me through the water, the water was knee deep” </span>(Ezekiel 47:4); from <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>it is derived that one <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to pass through </span>water that reaches <span class="gemarra-regular">up </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">knees. “He measured a thousand and led me through the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">water up to the waist” </span>(Ezekiel 47:4); from <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>it is derived that one <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to pass through </span>water that reaches <span class="gemarra-regular">up to the waist. From this </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">forward</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “And he measured a thousand, a river that I could</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not pass through” </span>(Ezekiel 47:5). This implies that one is never permitted to pass through water that is more than waist high, because it is dangerous. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>That is not a proof, because <span class="gemarra-regular">a river </span>with fast <span class="gemarra-regular">flowing water is different. </span>If it is higher than one’s waist, he could drown. However, one is permitted to cross still water even if it is deeper than that.
§ Apropos the river that will flow in the future, the Gemara explains additional verses in Ezekiel. <span class="gemarra-regular">One might think </span>that Ezekiel <span class="gemarra-regular">could cross </span>the river <span class="gemarra-regular">by swimming. The verse states: “For the water had swollen </span><span class="gemarra-regular">into </span><span class="gemarra-italic">saḥu</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> waters” </span>(Ezekiel 47:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">saḥu</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> waters” </span>mean? Water that can be traversed only with <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> boat </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">shiyuta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], as sailing [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shayta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is </span>sometimes <span class="gemarra-regular">called swimming [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sayḥa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. I might have thought </span>Ezekiel <span class="gemarra-regular">could pass across</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a small boat [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">burni</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">states: “No galley with oars shall go” </span>(Isaiah 33:21). I <span class="gemarra-regular">might have thought he could pass through in a large</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> boat. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “Neither shall a fishing boat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzi</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">adir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] be able to cross it” </span>(Isaiah 33:21). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>can it <span class="gemarra-regular">be inferred </span>that the words <span class="it-text">tzi</span> <span class="it-text">adir</span> mean fishing boat? The Gemara explains: This is how <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef translate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> this verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">A fishing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> boat [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sfinat</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tzayyadin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] will not travel on it and a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> large ship will not cross it.</span>
The Gemara continues its discussion of the river that will in the future come out of the Holy of Holies. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Pazi said: Even the Angel of Deat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not have permission to pass through it </span>to the other side of this river, and proof of this is in the verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written here: “No galley</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with oars [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ani</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">shayt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] can travel” and </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written there: </span>“Then Satan answered the Lord and said: <span class="gemarra-regular">From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> going to and fro [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mishut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the earth </span>and from walking up and down in it” (Job 1:7). Even Satan, who is also the Angel of Death, cannot cross through this river. 
The Gemara cites more <span class="it-text">midrashim</span> about the river that will flow from the Holy of Holies. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Pineḥas said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rav Huna of Tzippori: The spring </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that comes forth from inside the Holy of Holies </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">at first </span>very narrow <span class="gemarra-regular">and resembles grasshoppers’ antennae </span>in width. <span class="gemarra-regular">Once it reaches the opening of the Sanctuary it becomes </span>as thick <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">thread of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">warp; once it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reaches the Entrance Hall </span>of the Sanctuary, <span class="gemarra-regular">it becomes </span>as thick <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">thread of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">woof</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is wider than the warp thread. <span class="gemarra-regular">Once it reaches the opening</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard it becomes like the mouth of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a small jug. This is as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Water, </span>

Daf 78a

<span class="gemarra-regular">in the future, will bubble from under the threshold</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Temple</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. From this </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">forward, </span>the spring <span class="gemarra-regular">will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> grow in strengt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and rise until it reaches the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">opening of David’s house, </span>i.e., his grave, which is outside of Jerusalem. <span class="gemarra-regular">When it reaches the opening </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of David’s house, it will become a flowing river </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in which </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zavim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zavot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, menstruating women, and women </span><span class="gemarra-regular">after childbirth will bathe </span>to purify themselves. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated: “On that day there shall be a fountain opened </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for the house of David and to the inhabitants of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem for purification and for sprinkling” </span>(Zechariah 13:1). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> here, there is an allusion that a menstruating woman must</span> be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">si</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> up to her neck in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">water, </span>i.e., that this is the appropriate depth for waters of a ritual bath to purify. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">But the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in accordance with his </span>opinion. Rather, the depth of the water is irrelevant. As long as the water can cover an entire adult body, the ritual bath is kosher. 
§ The Gemara investigates the permissibility of crossing water in order to fulfill a mitzva: It works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well</span> that on <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur </span>it is permitted because <span class="gemarra-regular">there are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no shoes, </span>and there is no problem going through water barefoot. However, on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when there are shoes, what</span> is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is one permitted to cross water wearing shoes? Is there a concern that his shoe might come off and he may pick it up, thereby violating the prohibition of carrying out? <span class="gemarra-regular">Neḥemya, the son-in-law </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Nasi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, said: I saw Rabbi Ami and Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Asi come to a pool of water </span>that they had to cross on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they crossed it while wearing </span>their shoes without removing them first. 
The Gemara asks: It works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">shoes </span>are permitted, since one can tie them tightly, but <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">sandals? </span>Since they do not fit tightly on the foot, they might come off in the water. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Riḥumi said: I saw Ravina cross </span>a river while <span class="gemarra-regular">wearing </span>sandals on his feet. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: If he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>wearing <span class="gemarra-regular">sandals, </span>he should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>cross the water <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>lest the sandal fall off his foot and he violate the prohibition of carrying on Shabbat by picking it up. 
Incidental to this, the Gemara reports: <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Exilarch came to </span>deliver a lecture in <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Natan’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> study hall in Hagronya. Rafram and all the Sages came</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the lecture</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina did not come. The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> next day, </span>when he came, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rafram wanted to remove </span>any anger towards <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina from the mind </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Exilarch, </span>for missing the lecture. Rafram therefore asked Ravina: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master did not come to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lecture? He said to him: My foot hurt. </span>He said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">You should have put shoes on. </span>Ravina answered him: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was the back of the foot </span>that hurt, so wearing shoes would have been hard for me. 
Rafram said to Ravina: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span><span class="gemarra-regular">should have worn sandals, </span>which leave the heel exposed. <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: There was a pool of water on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the way </span>that I would have had to cross. <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You should have crossed it wearing </span>the sandals. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: Does the Master not hold </span>with that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> One should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>wear <span class="gemarra-regular">sandals </span>when crossing a river on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> From this conversation, the Exilarch understood that Ravina meant no disrespect in not attending the lecture. 
§ The Gemara continues to discuss the laws of Yom Kippur: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Gerogarot taught: It is prohibited to sit on </span>damp <span class="gemarra-regular">clay</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Yom Kippur. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: </span>This prohibition applies only when the <span class="gemarra-regular">clay </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">dripping wet, </span>when one feels its wetness when touching it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>in clarification: It must be <span class="gemarra-regular">dripping wet enough to make something</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> else wet. Rav Yehuda said: </span>One is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cool off with fruit </span>on Yom Kippur, and it is not considered bathing. Similarly, when <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda </span>suffered from the heat on Yom Kippur he <span class="gemarra-regular">cooled off </span>by putting <span class="gemarra-regular">a squash </span>on himself. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba cooled off by </span>placing <span class="gemarra-regular">a baby [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yanuka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> next to him, because a baby’s body is cold. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cooled off with a silver cup. Rav Pappa said: </span>If the <span class="gemarra-regular">silver cup </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">full, it is prohibited; </span>however, if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not full, it is permitted. </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a ceramic </span>cup, both <span class="gemarra-regular">this and that are prohibited, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the water <span class="gemarra-regular">seeps through </span>the cup, causing a violation of the prohibition of bathing. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: A silver </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cup that is not full is also prohibited because it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">can slip [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mizderiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> from his hand and spill.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ze’eira bar Ḥama, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">host </span>of the home where <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami, and Rabbi Asi, and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and all the Sages of Caesarea </span>stayed, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosef, son of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: Son of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lion, come, I will tell you </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">a wonderful custom</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that your father used to perform. He had a cloth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>he would prepare <span class="gemarra-regular">on the day before Yom Kippur</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by soaking it in water and </span>wringing it out, <span class="gemarra-regular">making</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>almost <span class="gemarra-regular">like a dried cloth. And the next </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day he wiped his face, hands, and feet with it. </span>On <span class="gemarra-regular">the day before the Ninth of Av, </span>on which the prohibition of bathing is by rabbinic law and not Torah law, he would <span class="gemarra-regular">soak the </span>cloth <span class="gemarra-regular">in water and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the next day pass it over his eyes.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Similarly, when Rabba bar Mari came </span>from Eretz Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: The day before the Ninth of Av </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they bring one a cloth, and he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">soak it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in wate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and place it under his head. The next</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day, </span>when only some moisture remains, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">wipe his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> face, hands, and feet </span>with it. <span class="gemarra-regular">On the day </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before Yom Kippur, they bring one a cloth, and he</span> may <span class="gemarra-regular">soak it in water and </span>wring it out to <span class="gemarra-regular">make it like a dried cloth. The next day, he</span> may <span class="gemarra-regular">pass it over his eyes. Rabbi Ya’akov said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to Rabbi Yirmeya bar Taḥlifa: You told us the opposite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> What you told us about Yom Kippur was really what he did on the Ninth of Av, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> objected to you </span>with regard to the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">wringing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>since Yom Kippur has the same prohibition of wringing that Shabbat has. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Menashya bar Taḥalifa said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Amram said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: They asked Rabbi Elazar </span>ben Pedat: Must <span class="gemarra-regular">an Elder who sits </span>and studies Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">in a yeshiva receive permissio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> from the <span class="it-text">Nasi</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to permit</span> him to render <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn animals permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> like others who must get permission from the <span class="it-text">Nasi</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>render <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn animals </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or not? </span>A firstborn animal may not be eaten until it has a blemish. Knowing which blemishes are permanent and permit the animal to be eaten and which are temporary is specialized knowledge. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">asking? </span>What is the basis of the question? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what they are asking, like this </span>statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Idi bar Avin, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: This matter, </span>the authority of the <span class="it-text">Nasi</span> to grant permission, <span class="gemarra-regular">was given to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the house of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Nas</span><span class="gemarra-italic">i</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to raise its stature. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">must permission be received, </span>since the request itself honors the <span class="it-text">Nasi</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or, perhaps because </span>the individual in question <span class="gemarra-regular">is an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Elder who sits </span>and studies Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">in a yeshiva, there</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is no need. Rav Tzadok ben Ḥaluka rose to his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> feet and said: I saw Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra, who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was an Elder who sat in the yeshiva and who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stood before the grandfather of this </span>current <span class="it-text">Nasi</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">ask permission</span> from him <span class="gemarra-regular">to permit firstborn animals. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>The way you described it <span class="gemarra-regular">was not how the incident</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was. Rather this was the incident: Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was a priest, and he raised the following dilemma: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Meir, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: One who is suspect in </span>a certain <span class="gemarra-regular">area </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not judge it and </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not testify </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">it? </span>Priests are suspected of inflicting blemishes on firstborn animals because after the destruction of the Temple, even priests may not benefit from a firstborn animal until it becomes blemished. The question was not one of seeking permission from the <span class="it-text">Nasi</span>, but it was a question of <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. Are priests who are Torah scholars also suspected of inflicting blemishes? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> perhaps the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>One who is suspect <span class="gemarra-regular">is believed about his fellow but is not believed about</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> himself. He resolved </span>the question for <span class="gemarra-regular">him: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">They raised </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma </span>before <span class="gemarra-regular">them, </span>the same Sages mentioned: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">going </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out in sandals made of</span>

Daf 78b

<span class="gemarra-regular">cor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Is it considered a shoe, and therefore it may not be worn on Yom Kippur, or not? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Naḥmani stood on his feet </span>to testify <span class="gemarra-regular">and said: I saw that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi went </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out on Yom Kippur in cork sandals, and I said </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to him: What </span>is the law <span class="gemarra-regular">on a communal fas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> that is decreed in a time of drought, when shoes are similarly prohibited? Are reed sandals permitted? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> me: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">no different, </span>and such sandals are permitted even on a communal fast day. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: I saw Rabbi Elazar from Nineveh go out in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cork sandals on a communal fast day, and I said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: What </span>is the law <span class="gemarra-regular">on Yom Kippur? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He said to me: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">no different, </span>and it is permitted. The Gemara reports: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda went out </span>on Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">in reed sandals. Abaye went out in </span>sandals made of <span class="gemarra-regular">palm fiber. Rava went out in </span>sandals braided with <span class="gemarra-regular">reeds. </span>None of these sandals are considered to be shoes. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna wrapped a scarf around his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">feet and went out. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama raised an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">objection: </span>We learned that <span class="gemarra-regular">an amputee </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">go out with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>wooden <span class="gemarra-regular">prosthetic leg </span>on Shabbat, since it is like a shoe; <span class="gemarra-regular">these are the words of Rabbi Meir. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabbi Yosei prohibits it. And </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in that regard </span>as an addendum to that mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they agree that it is prohibited to go out wearing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it on Yom Kippur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> As this indicates that even wooden shoes are prohibited, the materials worn by the aforementioned <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> should also be prohibited. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: There, </span>in the case of Yom Kippur, it is prohibited because <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are rags </span>in the prosthesis. The prohibition is not due to the shoes but <span class="gemarra-regular">due </span>to the <span class="gemarra-regular">pleasure</span> of the comfort, which is prohibited on Yom Kippur.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him: And if </span>the prosthetic leg<span class="gemarra-regular"> is not a garment, </span>meaning that it is not a shoe, do the <span class="gemarra-regular">rags </span><span class="gemarra-regular">make it into a garment? </span>Only shoes are forbidden, not other garments. <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, any </span>other kind of <span class="gemarra-regular">pleasure that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>the pleasure of wearing <span class="gemarra-regular">shoes, is it prohibited </span><span class="gemarra-regular">on Yom Kippur? </span>Only certain afflictions are mandated on Yom Kippur; activities that are not specifically restricted by those afflictions are permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba bar Rav Huna would wrap a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">scarf on his feet and go out, </span>demonstrating that the comfort provided by rags is permitted on Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">Furthermore,</span> the continuation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> contradicts your explanation that the prohibition is due to the comfort provided by the rags. <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it teaches in the latter clause</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: If </span>the prosthetic leg <span class="gemarra-regular">has a receptacle </span>designed <span class="gemarra-regular">for rags</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>is susceptible to <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity </span>like all wooden utensils which have receptacles, <span class="gemarra-regular">it may be inferred that in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the first clause we are not dealing with </span>a prosthetic leg that <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>a hollow space designed for <span class="gemarra-regular">rags. </span>Abaye’s position is thereby rejected.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: Actually, according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to everyone, </span>a prosthetic leg <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shoe, and with regard to Shabbat this is what they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">disagree about: One Sage, </span>Rabbi Yosei <span class="gemarra-regular">holds that we decree </span>a prohibition of wearing a prosthetic leg on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">lest </span>the leg <span class="gemarra-regular">slip off and one come to carry it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">four cubits </span>in the public domain; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one Sage, </span>Rabbi Meir, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds that we do not decree </span>such a rule.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sages taught: Young childre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are permitted </span>to perform <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the prohibited activities on Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wearing shoes. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">wearing</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shoes? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>observers who see a child wearing shoes <span class="gemarra-regular">will say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">adults did this for him, </span>i.e., put them on for him, since he cannot do it for himself. But if that is the reason, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>other prohibitions <span class="gemarra-regular">also, </span>like bathing and smearing oil, <span class="gemarra-regular">they will say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">adults did this for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him, </span>and children should be prohibited from those activities as well. The Gemara explains: With regard to bathing and smearing oil, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">say that they did this for him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">yesterday, </span>since one cannot be certain when the child was bathed. 
The Gemara asks: If so, we could <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>this with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">shoes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as well. They </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">say that they did this for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him yesterday. </span>The Gemara answers: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">shoes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, it is impossible </span>to say an adult <span class="gemarra-regular">did it for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him yesterday, </span>since the child would not have worn shoes at night. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Shmuel said: He who desires a taste</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of death should put on shoes and go to sleep</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are permitted</span> to wear shoes <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If so, it is permitted for an adult to perform these acts for a child even on the day of Yom Kippur, and the observer will not think that the adult has done anything wrong. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>we must explain the mishna as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> decreed </span>against performing <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>actions <span class="gemarra-regular">that are not </span>necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span> the child’s <span class="gemarra-regular">growth, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages did not decree</span> against performing <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>actions <span class="gemarra-regular">that are </span>necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the child’s <span class="gemarra-regular">growth. </span>As <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>My <span class="gemarra-regular">mother told me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> A child’s growth </span>requires <span class="gemarra-regular">hot water and oil </span>for smearing. When <span class="gemarra-regular">he grows a little, </span>he must eat <span class="gemarra-regular">egg with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kutaḥa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a pickled dip made with milk. <span class="gemarra-regular">When he grows a little </span>more, he must have <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels to break, </span>since he will enjoy breaking them. This is like <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">bought cracked ceramic vessel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> children, and they broke them </span>for their enjoyment.
§ We learned in the mishna that according to Rabbi Eliezer, <span class="gemarra-regular">the king and the bride </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">wash their faces </span>on Yom Kippur. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The Gemara answers: It is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥananya ben Teradyon, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The king and the bride </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wash their faces </span>on Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥananya ben Teradyon </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: A king and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a bride </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">wash their faces. </span>The Rabbis said: <span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">new mother </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not wear shoes </span>on Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥananya ben Teradyon says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">A new mother </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">wear shoes.</span>
The Gemara asks: According to Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the king </span>may wear shoes? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because it is written: “Your eyes shall see the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">king in his beauty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> (Isaiah 33:17). A king should always look regal before his nation. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">a bride </span>may wash her face? <span class="gemarra-regular">So that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">she should not </span>appear <span class="gemarra-regular">repulsive to her husband. </span>Since it is only the beginning of their marriage, her husband may be disgusted at seeing her otherwise. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said to Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥiyya: For how long </span>after her wedding is a woman considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a bride? He said to him: As it was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If she becomes a mourner, <span class="gemarra-regular">we</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do not prevent the bride from wearing perfume</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> during <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty days </span>of her marriage. This shows that for the first thirty days, her appearance is most critical.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A new mother </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">wear shoes. </span>What is the reason for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Due to the cold </span>there is concern that she will become ill, as she is weak from the birth.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>a man is worried about walking barefoot on Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the danger of scorpions</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to wear shoes, since one need not put himself in danger. 
§ We learned in the mishna: On Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who eats </span>food the <span class="gemarra-regular">volume of a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> large date </span>is liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa asked: </span>

Daf 79a

<span class="gemarra-regular">The large </span><span class="gemarra-regular">date-bul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that they said </span>is the measure that determines liability for eating on Yom Kippur, does this refer to the volume of a large date <span class="gemarra-regular">with its pit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">or without its pit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Ashi asked </span>a similar question: The mishna that states that <span class="gemarra-regular">a bone </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">a barley-grain-bulk </span>imparts ritual impurity, does this refer to the volume of a barley grain <span class="gemarra-regular">with its husk or without </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its husk? </span>And is that referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a wet </span>kernel <span class="gemarra-regular">or a dry </span>one? The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi did </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not ask </span>the question <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rav Pappa </span>asked, regarding the size of the date-bulk on Yom Kippur because the answer was clear to him. Since <span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Large, </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">as large as possible, </span>which must include the pit. Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa did not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ask </span>the question <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rav Ashi </span>asked regarding the size of the barley-grain-bulk because the answer was clear to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Wet </span>barley <span class="gemarra-regular">is called </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shibbolet</span> and not barley; <span class="gemarra-regular">without </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its shell </span>it is no longer called barley but <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">called </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ushla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Therefore, the mishna must be referring to dry barley within its shell. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda said: The volume of a large date that they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">larger than an egg-bulk. The Sages have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an </span>accepted <span class="gemarra-regular">tradition that with this </span>amount of food, the <span class="gemarra-regular">mind </span>of the one who eats <span class="gemarra-regular">is settled</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and he is not afflicted. <span class="gemarra-regular">Less than this </span>amount, <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mind is not settled. </span>The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from what we have learned: <span class="gemarra-regular">An incident </span>happened on the festival of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">They brought a cooked dish to Rabban Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Zakkai to taste, and </span>they brought <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabban Gamliel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> two dates and a tankar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of water. </span>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai and Rabban Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to them: <span class="gemarra-regular">Bring them </span><span class="gemarra-regular">up to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and we will eat there. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught in that regard: </span>They <span class="gemarra-regular">did not </span>act this way <span class="gemarra-regular">because that is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>that such food must be eaten in the <span class="it-text">sukka</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, they wished </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to be stringent upon themselves </span>and not eat anything outside of the <span class="it-text">sukka</span>.
On the other hand, the Gemara reports: <span class="gemarra-regular">And when they gave Rabbi Tzado</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> food</span> that was <span class="gemarra-regular">less than an egg-bulk </span>to eat, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> held it in a clot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> and did not wash his hands. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he ate it outside of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not recite </span>Grace after Meals <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward. </span>

Daf 79b

The Gemara clarifies: Food that has the volume of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">egg-bulk is required </span>to be eaten in <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If it should enter your mind </span>to say that the <span class="gemarra-regular">volume of the large date that they spoke of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is larger than </span>the volume of <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg-bulk, </span>there is a contradiction. <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, </span>comparing the two episodes, it seems that <span class="gemarra-regular">two dates without their pits are not </span>the volume of <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg. </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">can the volume of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">large date and its pit </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">greater than that of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">an egg-bulk? Rav Yirmeya said: Yes, </span>although <span class="gemarra-regular">two dates </span><span class="gemarra-regular">without their pits are not equal </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg-bulk, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the volume of a large date and its pit are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">larger than an egg-bulk, </span>since date pits are very large. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: This </span>explains the folk saying <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">people say: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of dates </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and more of pits, </span>meaning that the volume of the pit is larger than that of the fruit itself. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>This entire line of questioning has no basis: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>in the incident of the <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the reasoning </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> permits eating the dates outside of the <span class="it-text">sukka</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to</span> the fact that dates <span class="gemarra-regular">are fruit, and fruit need not</span> be eaten in <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukk</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> but may be eaten outside of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>. The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection. Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: When we would learn Torah with Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Elazar ben Shamua, they brought before us figs and grapes, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and we ate them as a casual meal outside of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara analyzes this: This implies that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a casual meal, yes, </span>it may be eaten outside of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>; but <span class="gemarra-regular">a fixed meal </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be eaten outside of a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>. Therefore, a meal consisting of fruit must be eaten in a <span class="it-text">sukka</span>. The Gemara rejects this: That is the wrong inference. Instead, <span class="gemarra-regular">say we ate them as if </span>they were <span class="gemarra-regular">a casual </span><span class="gemarra-regular">meal, </span>which may be eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">outside of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>meaning that eating fruit is always considered a snack. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>instead that it can be understood in this way: <span class="gemarra-regular">We ate </span>that fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">as a fixed meal, and we ate bread as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a casual meal with </span>the fruit, to temper their sweetness, <span class="gemarra-regular">outside of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>Rava. It teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, if one completed </span>consuming the amount that one is required to eat in the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with types of sweets</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he has fulfilled </span>his obligation of sitting in the <span class="it-text">sukka</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">If it should enter your mind </span>to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">fruit </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">required </span>to be eaten in <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>then it should not say sweets; <span class="gemarra-regular">let it teach fruit. </span>The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>do the words <span class="gemarra-regular">types of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sweets </span>mean? It means <span class="gemarra-regular">fruit. </span>Therefore, this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is not a support for Rava’s opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wish, say </span>that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where fruits are uncommon, </span>and therefore other sweet foods are eaten, but fruit can similarly complete the requirement. Consequently, no support can be brought from here. 
Until now, the Gemara has assumed that the volume of a large date is more than that of an egg. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zevid </span>disagreed with what was mentioned earlier and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>This is not so. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">the volume of a large date that they </span><span class="gemarra-regular">spoke </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">is less than an egg-bulk, as we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">leaven, </span>the sourdough used to make dough rise, ownership of <span class="gemarra-regular">the volume of an olive-bulk </span>violates the prohibitions in the following verses stated regarding Passover: “And no leavened bread shall be seen with you” (Exodus 13:7) and “Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses” (Exodus 12:19). However, the amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened brea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that must be owned to violate the prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">is the volume of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a large date. </span>
The Gemara continues. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we discussed it: What is the reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Beit Shammai? </span>If both leaven and leavened bread had the same measure that determines liability, <span class="gemarra-regular">let</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Merciful One write </span>only: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Leavened bread,” and </span>He would <span class="gemarra-regular">not need </span>to write: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Leaven.” I would say, </span>based on logic: <span class="gemarra-regular">If leavened bread, whose leavening ability is </span>not as <span class="gemarra-regular">strong, is prohibited </span>at <span class="gemarra-regular">an olive-bulk, all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the more so </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">not leaven, whose leavening ability is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">strong </span>because it causes dough to rise, be also prohibited at an olive-bulk? Since <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One distinguishes </span>between <span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>and states both “leaven” and “leavened bread,” this <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the measure for one is not </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">the measure for the other. </span>The measure that determines liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">leaven </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">an olive-bulk, </span>like in the case of most prohibitions from the Torah, and the measure that determines liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened bread, </span>whose leavening ability is weaker, is the <span class="gemarra-regular">volume of a large date.</span>
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it should enter your mind </span>to say: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">volume of the large date that they spoke </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">greater than an egg-bulk, since Beit Shammai are searching </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for the measure </span>one size <span class="gemarra-regular">larger than an olive-bulk</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as they proved that leavened bread must have a larger measure than an olive-bulk, and if the measure one size larger than an olive-bulk is an egg-bulk, then <span class="gemarra-regular">let them teach an egg-bulk </span>and not a date. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, if they are </span>exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">the same </span>volume, and the volume of a large date has the same volume as an egg-bulk, <span class="gemarra-regular">they should have taught an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">egg-bulk, </span>which is the more commonly used measure. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>must one <span class="gemarra-regular">not conclude from here that the volume of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a large date is less than an egg-bulk? </span>
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is your proof? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps I could actually say to you </span>that the measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">the volume of a large date that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they said is larger than an egg-bulk; </span>however, the volume of a date of <span class="gemarra-regular">normal </span>size is the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg-bulk, </span>and Beit Shammai were referring to a normal-sized date. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>say <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the volume of a large date and an egg-bulk <span class="gemarra-regular">are equal, and</span> the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">chose </span>to use <span class="gemarra-regular">one of them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Either way, there is no proof from here that the volume of a large date is greater than an egg-bulk.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it cannot be proven from here. Proof can be found <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: How much </span>must one eat <span class="gemarra-regular">to obligate </span>those with whom he ate in <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> invitation </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">zimmun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> for Grace After Meals? <span class="gemarra-regular">An olive-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">bulk </span>of food suffices to obligate those with whom they ate in a <span class="it-text">zimmun</span>; these are <span class="gemarra-regular">the words of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: An egg-bulk </span>is the minimum measure to obligate those with whom they ate in a <span class="it-text">zimmun</span>. The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they disagree? Rabbi Meir holds </span>that the verse “And you shall eat and be satisfied and bless the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 8:10) should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you shall eat”; this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">eating. “And be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> satisfied”; this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">drinking. </span>The definition of <span class="gemarra-regular">eating</span> throughout the Torah is consuming <span class="gemarra-regular">an olive-bulk. Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds: “And you shall eat and be satisfied” </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">eating that causes satisfaction, and what is that? </span>The volume of <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg-bulk. </span>Less than that amount of food is not satisfying. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it should enter your mind </span>to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">the volume of the large date that they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spoke </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">is larger than an egg-bulk, </span>the following question can be asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>that we have said that the volume of <span class="gemarra-regular">an egg-bulk satisfies, </span>can we say that <span class="gemarra-regular">it does not settle the mind, </span>and thereby remove the affliction of Yom Kippur? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>must one <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>this that <span class="gemarra-regular">the volume of a large date </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that they said is less than the size of an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">egg-bulk? </span>Eating the larger amount <span class="gemarra-regular">of an egg-bulk </span><span class="gemarra-regular">satisfies </span>a person, but eating <span class="gemarra-regular">the volume of a large </span><span class="gemarra-regular">date </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">settles his mind. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>

Daf 80a

<span class="gemarra-regular">All the measures </span>in the Torah connected to eating are the volume of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">olive-bulk</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> except for </span>the amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">food </span>that renders objects <span class="gemarra-regular">impure, because the verse changed its expression </span>in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Sages altered the measur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> accordingly. <span class="gemarra-regular">The proof of this, </span>that the Sages gave it a different measure because the verse used different language for it, is from <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur. </span>Also in the case of Yom Kippur the Sages assigned a different measure because the verse used a different phrase. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span>Sages learn that the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse changed its expression? </span>They learned <span class="gemarra-regular">from: </span>“Any soul which <span class="gemarra-regular">shall not be afflicted”</span> (Leviticus 23:29). The verse does not state: Any soul that shall eat, but rather: “Any soul which shall not be afflicted.” <span class="gemarra-regular">How did the Sages change its measure? </span>One does not violate the prohibition unless he has eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">the volume</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a large date-bulk, </span>as opposed to the usual olive-bulk.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what</span> does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> mean when it says: <span class="gemarra-regular">A proof for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> thi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> is from <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur? </span>Why is the verse pertaining to ritual impurity not sufficient to show that the Sages changed the measure based on the different words in the verse? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>we learned it only from <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>the case of impurity, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said that that is the style of the verse, </span>and no <span class="it-text">halakha</span> can be derived from it. Therefore, the verse pertaining to Yom Kippur teaches that whenever a verse deviates from the usual language, it implies a change in the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> as well. 
§ The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do we </span>derive that the measure for <span class="gemarra-regular">impure foods </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the volume of an egg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-bulk</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Abbahu</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said that Rabbi Elazar said that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the verse states: “Of all food [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">okhel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] which may be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eaten [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ye’akhel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>on which water comes shall be ritually impure” (Leviticus 11:34). The double usage of the root <span class="it-text">akhal</span> teaches that the ritual impurity of food applies even to the amount which can be described as <span class="gemarra-regular">food that comes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on account of food, </span>i.e., food that comes from another food. <span class="gemarra-regular">And which </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">is that? A chicken egg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And say </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> kid, </span>which comes from a mother goat, and is therefore also food that comes from another food. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It lacks ritual slaughter. </span>The young goat is not yet food, since it is not edible until it has been slaughtered. The Gemara asks further: <span class="gemarra-regular">And say </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ben</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">pekua</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since the slaughter of its mother made it fit to eat, the fetus itself need not be slaughtered, even if it survives and continues to live independently of its mother. The Gemara answers: The calf still <span class="gemarra-regular">requires cutting</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since it cannot be eaten live, but it does not require ritual slaughter.
The Gemara asks: Even if we claim that the measure for impure foods is an egg-bulk, one could <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>it is referring to the giant <span class="gemarra-regular">egg</span>-<span class="gemarra-regular">bulk </span>of the bird called <span class="gemarra-italic">bar</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">yokhani</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you grasped many, you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">did not grasp anything; if you grasped few, you grasped </span><span class="gemarra-regular">something. </span>This means that in a case of doubt, take the smaller number, as it is included in the larger number. Therefore, the correct measure is the volume of a chicken egg. The Gemara questions this: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a very small bird’s egg. </span>Consequently, no proof can be brought from the verse that the volume of a chicken egg is the measure for ritual impurity. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu himself </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Of all food which may be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eaten.” </span>This is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">food that you </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">eat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at one time. The Sages estimated: The esophagus cannot hold</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> more </span>than the volume of <span class="gemarra-regular">a chicken’s egg, </span>and therefore this is the measure used for the ritual impurity of foods. 
Incidental to the discussion on Torah measures, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: One who </span>unwittingly <span class="gemarra-regular">eats </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">fat </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">today must write down the </span>exact <span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>that he ate, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest another court come </span>in the future <span class="gemarra-regular">and increase the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> measure. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What does </span>it mean to <span class="gemarra-regular">increase the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> measure? If we say </span>that a future court <span class="gemarra-regular">will obligate</span> him to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering </span>even for the <span class="gemarra-regular">bulk </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a small olive, </span>which is less than what is considered an olive-bulk today, he would not be liable to bring a guilt<span class="gemarra-regular">-</span>offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: It was said with regard to guilt-offerings: “And if any one of the common people sin through error, in doing any of the things which the Lord has commanded <span class="gemarra-regular">not to be done, and be guilty” </span>(Leviticus 4:27)? This teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who repents due to his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> awareness</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., one who repents following becoming aware that he performed a transgression, <span class="gemarra-regular">brings an offering for his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> unwitting </span>transgression. 
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> repent due to his awareness </span>that he sinned <span class="gemarra-regular">does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bring an offering for his unwitting </span>action. Similarly, if one eats less than an olive-bulk, based on the current measures, he will not be obligated to bring a guilt-offering in the future if the measures change, even if the amount that he ate equals the volume of a revised olive-bulk. This is because the individual would not be bringing his offering because he became aware he had sinned, but because the Torah measures had been changed.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it should be explained as follows: It is possible that in the future a court <span class="gemarra-regular">will not obligate </span>one to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering until he has </span>eaten the bulk <span class="gemarra-regular">of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">large olive, </span>which is more than today’s amount. One should write down how much he ate, since in the future a court might rule that the amount he ate is less than the size of an olive, and therefore he will not be obligated to bring an offering.
The Gemara returns to its first suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to what entered his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mind initially, </span>that in the future a court might <span class="gemarra-regular">obligate </span>him to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering </span>for the bulk of a <span class="gemarra-regular">small olive, what </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">increase the measure? </span>Rabbi Elazar should have said decrease the measure. The Gemara answers: The statement may have meant that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps there will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be an increase in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">offerings</span> that are brought <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the smaller <span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>for liability.
With regard to this topic, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Measures and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">punishments are </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> transmitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to Moses from Sinai. </span>The Gemara expresses surprise at this: <span class="gemarra-regular">The punishments </span>for all transgressions <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>explicitly in the Torah, and therefore are not part of an oral transmission from Moses. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, this is </span>what was <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Measures </span>that determine liability <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">punishment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> transmitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to Moses from Sinai. </span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">This was also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Measures of punishments are </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> transmitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to Moses from Sinai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Others say: </span>These measures <span class="gemarra-regular">were instituted by the court of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Jabez</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara questions this: How can this be? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it written: “These are the mitzvot which the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lord commanded Moses for the children of Israel at Mount</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sinai” </span>(Leviticus 27:34). The word “these” underscores <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a prophet is not permitted to introduce </span>any new <span class="gemarra-regular">element </span>related to the Torah and its mitzvot <span class="gemarra-regular">from here on.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rather, </span>over the course of time, the people <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot </span>the measures; subsequently the prophets <span class="gemarra-regular">reestablished </span>the measures and taught them to the masses. 
§ We learned in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who drinks a cheekful </span>on Yom Kippur is liable. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: This does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>mean two <span class="gemarra-regular">cheeks actually full. Rather, </span>the measure that determines liability is the volume of liquid <span class="gemarra-regular">if one pushes</span> the drink <span class="gemarra-regular">to one side </span>of his mouth, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it appears as though his cheek were full. </span>The Gemara questions this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">A</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cheekful, </span>in the plural form, meaning two cheeks full? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say: Like </span>two <span class="gemarra-regular">cheeks full </span>in appearance. If viewed from only one side, one whose cheek is full appears as if his entire mouth is full.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to this from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">How much </span>does one need to <span class="gemarra-regular">drink </span>on Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">to be liable? Beit Shammai say: A quarter-</span><span class="it-text">log</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel say: </span>Two <span class="gemarra-regular">cheeks full. Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: Like </span>two <span class="gemarra-regular">cheeks full </span>in appearance from the side, i.e. a single cheekful. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">amount </span>that one can <span class="gemarra-regular">swallow </span>in one gulp. In this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, Beit Hillel’s opinion is that the measure for drinking on Yom Kippur is a cheekful. This implies that a cheekful means an actual cheekful.
The Gemara expresses surprise: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">preferable to the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mishna? Since it was established </span>that the measure in the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">so that it appears </span>like a cheekful, <span class="gemarra-regular">so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> too, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> can be explained as meaning an amount <span class="gemarra-regular">that looks like </span>two cheeks full. The Gemara questions further: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>Beit Hillel require an amount that appears like two cheeks full; <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>identical with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, </span>who says: Like two cheeks full. The Gemara answers: We could say that the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them</span> is evident in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a paltry cheekful, </span>which is not a complete mouthful but slightly less. According to Beit Hillel, one is not liable unless he drinks a full cheekful; but according to Rabbi Eliezer, one is liable even for a paltry mouthful. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hoshaya strongly objects to this </span>understanding: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>if Beit Hillel’s measure is a single cheekful, then <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>an instance of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s leniencies and Beit Hillel’s stringencies, </span>since the measure of a quarter-<span class="it-text">log</span> is larger than a single cheekful. If so, why isn’t this debate listed in tractate <span class="it-text">Eduyyot</span>, which lists all the cases where Beit Shammai are more lenient than Beit Hillel? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: </span>

Daf 80b

<span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>this question with regard to the measure of liquid <span class="gemarra-regular">was asked, </span>it was not asked about an average-sized person, for whom a mouthful is smaller than a quarter-<span class="it-text">log</span>. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">the question was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">asked </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">about Og, king of Bashan, </span>in which case, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is Beit Shammai </span>who are <span class="gemarra-regular">stringent, </span>for Og’s cheekful is much more than a quarter-<span class="it-text">log</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira strongly objects to this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to the measure for liability for drinking: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">different </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">eating</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">that all people </span>have the same measure, the <span class="gemarra-regular">volume of a large date</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and what is different </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">drinking, where each</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and every </span>person is liable <span class="gemarra-regular">according to his own measure</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., every individual’s measure depends on the size of his own mouth? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: The Sages</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have </span>an accepted <span class="gemarra-regular">tradition </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the volume of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the large date, that </span>eating <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>amount <span class="gemarra-regular">settles his mind</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">less than this </span>amount <span class="gemarra-regular">does not settle </span>his mind. However, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">drinking, his mind is settled with</span> the amount of <span class="gemarra-regular">his own </span>cheekful, <span class="gemarra-regular">but his mind is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not settled </span>with the cheekful <span class="gemarra-regular">of his fellow </span>who is smaller than him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira strongly objects</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to this </span>for a different reason: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is everyone </span>of average size satisfied <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>eating <span class="gemarra-regular">the volume of a large date</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">Og, king of Bashan, </span>is also satisfied <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the volume of a large date? </span>If not, there should also be relative measures for eating. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: The Sages have </span>an accepted <span class="gemarra-regular">tradition that this </span>amount <span class="gemarra-regular">settles</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his mind, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">less than this </span>amount <span class="gemarra-regular">does not settle</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his mind. However, everyone </span>of average size has his mind <span class="gemarra-regular">greatly </span>settled, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Og, king of Bashan, </span>has his mind only <span class="gemarra-regular">a little </span>settled. But even so, this measure settles the mind of any person and relieves his affliction.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira strongly objects to this </span>further: If it is on account of settling one’s mind, the following question can be raised: If one ate <span class="gemarra-regular">fatty meat, </span>his mind would be settled with the <span class="gemarra-regular">volume</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a large date, </span>but if he ate edible <span class="gemarra-regular">grapevine shoots, </span>would his mind similarly settled <span class="gemarra-regular">with the volume</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a large date? Abaye said to him: The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Sages have </span>an accepted <span class="gemarra-regular">tradition that with this </span>measure <span class="gemarra-regular">one’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s mind is settled, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">with less than </span>measure <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mind is not settled. However, </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">fatty meat, </span>his mind is <span class="gemarra-regular">greatly </span>settled; if one ate the same measure of <span class="gemarra-regular">grapevine shoots, </span>his mind is only <span class="gemarra-regular">a little </span>settled.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> strongly objects to this: </span>For all prohibitions of eating, the measure that determines liability is the volume <span class="gemarra-regular">of an olive</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-bulk </span>consumed <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>the time it takes <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> half-loaf of bread. </span>All forbidden food eaten within that period combines to the measure of an olive-bulk. However, one who eats an olive-bulk over a longer period is exempt. Yet, on Yom Kippur one who eats the <span class="gemarra-regular">volume of a large date, </span>which is a larger measure, is culpable if this amount is eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>the time it would take <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat a half-loaf of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bread. </span>This appears to be a leniency, since one must eat a larger measure in the same time period of time. Why is there not a longer period of time for liability on Yom Kippur, to reflect the larger measure? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: The Sages have </span>an accepted <span class="gemarra-regular">tradition </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one who eats within <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>duration of time, <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mind is settled; but </span>one who eats within <span class="gemarra-regular">a longer </span>duration of time, <span class="gemarra-regular">his mind is not settled, </span>and he remains in a state of affliction.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava strongly objects to this: </span>The measure for liability for eating on Yom Kippur is the <span class="gemarra-regular">volume of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a large date </span>consumed <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>the time it takes <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eat a half-loaf of bread; </span>but the measure for eating impure foods that render one ritually impure is <span class="gemarra-regular">half of a half-loaf, </span>which is two egg-bulks, a much larger volume, and this must also be consumed <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>the time it takes <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat a half-loaf</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of brea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Pappa said to him: </span>Do not raise a challenge from here. <span class="gemarra-regular">Leave </span>aside <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the bod</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> contracted through consuming impure foods <span class="gemarra-regular">because that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not by Torah law </span>but by rabbinic law. The Sages were lenient in this matter. If one does not consume that amount of impure food within this time period, he is not rendered impure. 
The Gemara challenges this: <span class="gemarra-regular">But did Rav Pappa </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say that </span>the rendering of ritual impurity of the body through the consumption of impure foods is by rabbinic law? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>he appears to say the opposite in another statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it written: </span>“You shall not make yourselves detestable with any creeping thing that creeps, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you make yourselves impure with them, that you should be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">impure thereby” </span>(Leviticus 11:43). <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Pappa said: From here</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>from the Torah’s usage of the word “impure” with regard to the prohibition of eating, we learn that <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> impurity of the body is by Torah law. </span>The Gemara answers: Rav Pappa did not mean that the law is actually Torah law. The law is indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">rabbinic </span>law, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the verse </span>brought as proof <span class="gemarra-regular">is a mere support</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">All </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">foods </span>combine to form a measure of liability with regard to eating on Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">ate meat</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">salt </span>that was on it, these <span class="gemarra-regular">combine </span>to make the volume of a large date. <span class="gemarra-regular">Although </span>consuming salt alone <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">eating, since people do eat </span>meat with salt together, <span class="gemarra-regular">they combine </span>into one measure. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: Brine on a vegetable combines </span>with the vegetable to make the <span class="gemarra-regular">volume of a large date </span>with regard to the prohibition of eating <span class="gemarra-regular">on Yom Kippur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara expresses surprise at this: <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious. </span>Why should the brine not combine with the vegetable, considering that it is itself food? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that brine is <span class="gemarra-regular">a beverage, </span>and food and drinks do not combine, <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches us </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">any item that prepares</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> food </span>for eating <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a food.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: One who eats</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">an excessive manne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Yom Kippur, </span>to the degree that he forces himself to continue eating even when full <span class="gemarra-regular">is exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> e.g., one who ate beyond being satiated on Yom Kippur eve and then ate something else as soon as the fast began. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>for that? Because the Torah does not mention the prohibition of eating on Yom Kippur, but it <span class="gemarra-regular">was written </span>“any soul which <span class="gemarra-regular">shall not be afflicted </span>in that same day, he shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 23:29), <span class="gemarra-regular">excluding one who harms </span>himself, e.g., one who does not enjoy his food at all.
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: A non-priest who ate </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in an excessive </span><span class="gemarra-regular">manne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pays the principal, </span>that which he took, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not pay the </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">fifth, </span>which one who illegally eats <span class="it-text">teruma</span> pays to the priest as a penalty. This is because it states about one who eats <span class="it-text">teruma</span>: “And <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>a man <span class="gemarra-regular">eat </span>of the sacred thing in error, then he shall add a fifth to it, and give the priest the sacred thing” (Leviticus 22:14). The word “eat” <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes </span>one who is not eating but <span class="gemarra-regular">harming </span>himself. He does, however, pay the principal, since he caused a loss to the priest. The fifth is only paid by one who eats normally, not excessively. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A non-priest</span>

Daf 81a

<span class="gemarra-regular">who chews on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">barley of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">terum</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> that has not been ground or baked <span class="gemarra-regular">pays the principal and not </span>an extra <span class="gemarra-regular">fifth. </span>The reason is that it states <span class="gemarra-regular">“eats” </span>(Leviticus 22:14), <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span><span class="gemarra-regular">excludes one who harms </span>himself. Consuming raw barley is considered self-harm, not eating.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheizvi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who swallowed plums of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">terum</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> whole <span class="gemarra-regular">and vomited them </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out, </span>whereupon <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">ate them, the first </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">pays</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the principal plus a fifth. </span>When the first one benefited from the plums, he acquired them and must therefore pay for them, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>one must pay their worth to the first one. Since they are only fit for fuel after the first one vomited them out, the second person is considered to have damaged their value as fuel. Therefore, he <span class="gemarra-regular">pays only the price of wood, </span>i.e., fuel, <span class="gemarra-regular">to the first </span>person.
§ It was taught in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">food and drink do not combine</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: </span>This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught as a dispute</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua. As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehoshua stated a general principle: Any </span>item <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">identical </span>to another item in <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>type of <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity, </span>e.g., impurity that lasts only until evening, <span class="gemarra-regular">and its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>for impurity, e.g., an olive-bulk, <span class="gemarra-regular">combines </span>with the other item to reach one measure to render other items impure. Therefore, two half olive-bulk pieces of two corpses or of two animal carcasses, or two half lentil-bulk pieces from two creeping animals all combine to render other items impure.
However, if one item is identical to another in <span class="gemarra-regular">its ritual impurity but not its measure,</span> e.g., half a lentil-bulk of a creeping animal and half an olive-bulk of an animal carcass, which both impart impurity until nightfall; <span class="gemarra-regular">or if its measure </span>is identical <span class="gemarra-regular">but not its </span>type of <span class="gemarra-regular">ritual impurity, </span>e.g., half an olive-bulk from a corpse, which imparts impurity for seven days, and half an olive-bulk from an animal carcass, which imparts impurity until nightfall; and all the more so, when <span class="gemarra-regular">neither its ritual impurity nor its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">measure </span>are identical, then the items <span class="gemarra-regular">do not combine. </span>Here, too, although both eating and drinking are prohibited on their own, they do not combine because they do not have the same measure that imparts impurity. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, until now we have </span>heard <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis say</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there </span>that items with different measures combine <span class="gemarra-regular">only with respect</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to ritual impurity. Since the </span>phenomenon <span class="gemarra-regular">of ritual impurity is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one concept, </span>different types combine. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>in the case of Yom Kippur, the measure that determines liability is set <span class="gemarra-regular">due to settling the mind, and this </span>combination of eating and drinking together <span class="gemarra-regular">does not settle the mind. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, Reish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Lakish said: </span>This question of whether food and drink combine to reach a measure that determines liability on Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught as a dispute. </span>The approach brought in the mishna that states that they do not combine is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua, as we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua stated a general principle </span>with regard to whether items with different types of impurity and measures combine, as Rav Ḥisda explained above. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in accordance with the opinion of Rav Naḥman: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, until now we have </span>heard <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis say there </span>that items with different measures combine <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to ritual impurity. But here, </span>in the case of Yom Kippur, the measure that determines liability is set <span class="gemarra-regular">due to settling the mind, and this </span>combination of eating and drinking together <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>settle the mind.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">one ate</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and drank </span>unwittingly <span class="gemarra-regular">within one lapse of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">awareness</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> e.g., he forgot that it is Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">only one sin-offering. </span>However, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he ate and performed labor </span>unwittingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is liable to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bring two sin-offerings, </span>as by doing so he violated two separate prohibitions. If <span class="gemarra-regular">he ate foods that are not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fit for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eating</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or drank liquids that are not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fit for drinking, or drank </span>fish <span class="gemarra-regular">brine or </span>the briny <span class="gemarra-regular">liquid </span>in which fish are pickled, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is exempt, </span>as that is not the typical manner of eating or drinking.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: Why is there no </span><span class="gemarra-regular">warnin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">stated about </span><span class="gemarra-regular">affliction</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> why did the Torah not state explicitly that it is prohibited to eat and drink on Yom Kippur? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it was not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">possible </span>to write it that way. The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span><span class="gemarra-regular">could </span>the Merciful One <span class="gemarra-regular">write it? Let the Merciful One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">write: One shall not eat </span>on Yom Kippur. The term eat prohibits <span class="gemarra-regular">eating the amount of an olive-bulk, </span>whereas on Yom Kippur the actual prohibited measure is a large date-bulk. <span class="gemarra-regular">Let the Merciful One write: Do not be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> afflicted. </span>That indicates the opposite of affliction, and would <span class="gemarra-regular">mean: Get up and eat. </span>Therefore, it is written: “For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted on that same day, he shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 23:29). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hoshaya strongly objects to this: Let the Merciful</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> One write </span>it in this manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">Guard yourself lest </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you not be afflicted. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would be </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">many negative mitzvot, </span>as the following are all expressions of prohibition: Guard, lest, and not. One would then say that there are three prohibitions against eating. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Beivai bar Abaye </span><span class="gemarra-regular">strongly objects to this: Let the Merciful One write: Guard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">yourself in the mitzva of affliction. </span>The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>there is a principle: If the words <span class="gemarra-regular">guard </span><span class="gemarra-regular">yourself </span>are written <span class="gemarra-regular">about a prohibition, </span>it is considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a prohibition; </span>if the words <span class="gemarra-regular">guard yourself </span>are written <span class="gemarra-regular">about a positive mitzva, </span>it is considered to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> positive mitzva. </span>Had the Torah written it that way, one would understand that there is a positive mitzva of affliction, but there is no element of prohibition. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi strongly</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> objects to this: Let the Merciful One write: Do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stray from afflicting yourself, </span>which would imply a negative mitzva. The Gemara says: Indeed, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. </span>The Gemara concedes that it could have been written in this manner.
§ With regard to the prohibitions against eating and labor, the Gemara says: <span class="gemarra-regular">And a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cites </span>the prohibitions relating to affliction on Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">from here: </span>It is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall afflict </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your souls, you shall do no manner of labor” </span>(Numbers 29:7). The Gemara considers: One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that performing labor during the <span class="gemarra-regular">extension </span>of the period of prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">of labor, </span>added before Yom Kippur actually begins, <span class="gemarra-regular">is punishable </span>by <span class="it-text">karet</span>. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And whatsoever soul it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be that does any manner of labor on that same </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day” </span>(Leviticus 23:30), which teaches that performing labor <span class="gemarra-regular">on that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> very day is punishable by </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but </span>labor performed during <span class="gemarra-regular">the extension </span>of the period of prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">of labor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not punishable by </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that performing labor during the <span class="gemarra-regular">extension </span>of the period of prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">of labor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not punishable by </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>but not afflicting oneself during the <span class="gemarra-regular">extension </span>of the period <span class="gemarra-regular">of affliction is punishable by</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “For whatsoever soul it be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that shall not be afflicted on that same day, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall be cut off </span>from his people” (Leviticus 23:29), which teaches that not afflicting oneself <span class="gemarra-regular">on that very day </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">punishable by </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but </span>not afflicting oneself during <span class="gemarra-regular">the extension</span> of the period <span class="gemarra-regular">of affliction is not punishable by </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> one who performs labor during the extension would <span class="gemarra-regular">not be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> included in the punishment </span>of <span class="it-text">karet</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he would be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> warned against </span>performing labor during the <span class="gemarra-regular">extension </span>of the period of prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">of labor </span>with a prohibition incurring the punishment of lashes; therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall do no manner of labor on that same day”</span> (Leviticus 23:28). That teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is warned </span>not to perform labor on <span class="gemarra-regular">that very day, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> warned against </span>performing labor during the <span class="gemarra-regular">extension </span>of the period of prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">of labor, </span>and therefore he is not liable to receive lashes for doing so. 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought: <span class="gemarra-regular">He would not be warned with regard to</span> performing labor during the <span class="gemarra-regular">extension </span>of the period of prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">of labor </span>that it is a prohibition that incurs lashes; <span class="gemarra-regular">but he would be warned with regard to </span>not being in a state of affliction during the <span class="gemarra-regular">extension </span>of the period <span class="gemarra-regular">of affliction </span>that it is a prohibition that incurs lashes. However, that is incorrect, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is learned from <span class="gemarra-regular">a logical derivation </span>that it is not so: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">labor, whose </span>prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">is observed on </span>both <span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Festivals, one is not warned about </span>the extension added to the day, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not logical that </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">affliction, which is not observed on </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festivals, he should not be warned about </span>or liable to receive lashes for the extension? 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">But the warning</span> about lashes <span class="gemarra-regular">during the very day itself we have not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learned. From where </span>is it derived? The Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">need not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> state the punishment </span>of <span class="it-text">karet</span> for performing <span class="gemarra-regular">labor, since one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> can learn it </span>by logical derivation <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the punishment of not being in a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">affliction, </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>the requirement of <span class="gemarra-regular">affliction, which is not observed on</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Festivals, is punishable by </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span> on Yom Kippur, with regard to the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">labor, which is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">observed on </span>all <span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Festivals, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the more so? </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>is the punishment for labor <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>explicitly? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is available to compare and learn</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a verbal analogy from it: A punishment </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">affliction is stated, and a punishment </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">labor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is stated. Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">labor one is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> punished only if he was warned </span>first with a negative mitzva, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">affliction, one is punished</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only if he was warned.</span>
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>comparison can <span class="gemarra-regular">be refuted. </span>How so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Whereas affliction </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">no permitted </span>exceptions <span class="gemarra-regular">from its general </span>prohibition, as the mitzva to afflict oneself applies to all the Jewish people, what can <span class="gemarra-regular">you say with regard to labor, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>exceptions <span class="gemarra-regular">from its general </span>prohibition? It is permitted to perform the Temple services on Yom Kippur, which include prohibited labors, e.g., slaughtering animals and offering incense. Consequently, there is no proof that the mitzva of affliction is more lenient than the prohibition of labor. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather,</span> say as follows: The Torah need <span class="gemarra-regular">not say the punishment</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>not being in a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">affliction, since one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> can learn it from </span>the punishment for performing <span class="gemarra-regular">labor </span>through an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference. How so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as labor, for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which </span>exceptions <span class="gemarra-regular">from the general </span>prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted, </span>e.g., performing the Temple service on Yom Kippur, and yet labor <span class="gemarra-regular">is punishable by </span><span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>with regard to not being in a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">affliction, which has no permitted </span>exceptions <span class="gemarra-regular">from its general </span>prohibition, is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not all the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">more so </span>that one who does not afflict himself should be liable to receive <span class="it-text">karet</span>? If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">why is it </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">stated? It is available to compare and learn a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verbal analogy: Punishment is stated with regard to affliction, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> punishment is stated with regard to labor. Just as for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> labor </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">punished and warned, so too, for affliction</span> the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">punished and warned.</span>
The Gemara rejects this: This comparison <span class="gemarra-regular">can be refuted, </span>and one might say the opposite: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whereas </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">labor is observed on </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Festivals, </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">about affliction, which is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not observed on </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Festivals?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>We did not properly understand the teaching of this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, as <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> derived </span>a verbal analogy from the words “on that <span class="gemarra-regular">same </span>day” (Leviticus 23:29) stated with regard to affliction, and “on that <span class="gemarra-regular">same </span>day” (Leviticus 23:28) stated with regard to labor. The Gemara comments: We must say that <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is available, </span>meaning that in both places, the phrase “on that same day” is unnecessary within its own context and comes only to teach this verbal analogy; <span class="gemarra-regular">as, if it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were not available, it could be refuted, as we refuted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it </span>above. 
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, it is certainly available, </span>and we may learn from it, as <span class="gemarra-regular">five verses are written </span>with regard to the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">labor </span>on Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>to teach <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">warning </span>with regard to the prohibition of labor <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">day </span>of Yom Kippur itself; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one for a warning </span>with regard to labor <span class="gemarra-regular">on the night </span>of Yom Kippur; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one for the punishment </span>of <span class="it-text">karet</span> for performing labor <span class="gemarra-regular">on the day; and one for the punishment </span>for performing labor <span class="gemarra-regular">at night; and one </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">to be available </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to derive </span>the requirement of <span class="gemarra-regular">affliction from </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">labor, both during the day and night, </span>using a verbal analogy.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught </span>an alternative verbal analogy for the derivation: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Affliction” is stated here,</span> with regard to Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">and “affliction” is stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> later, </span>with regard to a man who rapes a woman: “Because he has afflicted his neighbor’s wife” (Deuteronomy 22:24). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as there, </span>in the case of rape, the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">did not punish unless there was </span>prior <span class="gemarra-regular">warning, so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> too here, </span>in the case of Yom Kippur, the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">did not punish unless there was </span>prior <span class="gemarra-regular">warning. Rav Aḥa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bar Ya’akov said </span>a different proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Derive </span>a verbal analogy from the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“Shabbat of solemn rest” </span>(Leviticus 16:31) written with regard to Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the words “Shabbat of solemn rest” (Exodus 31:15, 32:5; Leviticus 23:3) written with regard to the weekly Shabbat, which commemorates the <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Creation. Just as there, </span>in the case of Shabbat, the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">did not punish unless there was </span>prior <span class="gemarra-regular">warning</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, so too here, </span>in the case of Yom Kippur, the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">did not punish unless there was </span>prior <span class="gemarra-regular">warning</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>

Daf 81b

Yom Kippur <span class="gemarra-regular">itself is called “Shabbat,” as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written: </span>“From evening until evening, <span class="gemarra-regular">you shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rest on your Shabbat” </span>(Leviticus 23:32). The Gemara compares the various opinions. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, Rav Pappa did not say as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov </span>did because <span class="gemarra-regular">a verse that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is written about the matter itself is preferable </span>to a verbal analogy. <span class="gemarra-regular">But what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bar Ya’akov did not state </span>his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with the opinion of Rav Pappa? </span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He requires this </span>verse of “keep your Shabbat” <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that which was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall afflict your souls on the ninth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day of the month </span>at evening, from evening until evening, you shall rest on your Shabbat” (Leviticus 23:32). One <span class="gemarra-regular">might</span> have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">one should start to afflict oneself on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the ninth </span>of Tishrei; therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states “at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">evening.” If </span>the Torah had stated only <span class="gemarra-regular">“at evening,” </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that the fast starts only <span class="gemarra-regular">when darkness </span><span class="gemarra-regular">falls; </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states “on the ninth,” </span>implying that one begins to fast on the ninth of Tishrei. <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>can these verses be reconciled? <span class="gemarra-regular">One begins to fast </span><span class="gemarra-regular">while it is still daytime; from here </span>it is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that one </span>sanctifies and <span class="gemarra-regular">extends from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred </span>weekday <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred </span>day of Yom Kippur.
<span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>that one must add time <span class="gemarra-regular">at the beginning </span>of Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>do I derive that one adds time <span class="gemarra-regular">at the conclusion of </span>Yom Kippur? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “From evening until evening” </span>(Leviticus 23:32),implying that one adds at the end as well, just as he does at the beginning. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>have derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>the mitzva of adding to <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Kippur; from where </span>is it derived that one must also sanctify and append time before and after <span class="gemarra-regular">Festivals? The verse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">states: “You shall rest” </span>(Leviticus 23:32), to teach that this rule applies even to Festivals, on which one is commanded to rest. <span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>that one adds an extension to <span class="gemarra-regular">Festivals; from where </span>do I derive that one must also sanctify and append to <span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? The verse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">states: “Your Shabbat” </span>(Leviticus 23:32). <span class="gemarra-regular">How so? Every place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the term: Rest [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shevut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] is stated, </span>it teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">from here </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that one </span>sanctifies and <span class="gemarra-regular">appends from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred </span>weekday <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sacred</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> who learns a verbal analogy from the words “that <span class="gemarra-regular">same </span>day,” “that <span class="gemarra-regular">same </span>day,” <span class="gemarra-regular">what does he do with </span>the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“On the ninth day of the month”? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He requires it, in accordance with </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Ḥiyya bar Rav of Difti taught. As Ḥiyya bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav of Difti taught: </span>It states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">afflict your souls on the ninth </span>day of the month” (Leviticus 23:32). <span class="gemarra-regular">But does one afflict oneself on the ninth </span>of Tishrei? <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t one </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">afflict oneself on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the tenth </span>of Tishrei? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the verse comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to tell</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you: Anyone who eats and drinks on the ninth </span>of Tishrei and then fasts on the tenth, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse ascribes</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him </span>credit <span class="gemarra-regular">as though he fasted on </span>both the <span class="gemarra-regular">ninth</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the tenth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The verse alludes to this when it states that the fast is on the ninth.
§ It was taught in the mishna: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">ate food that is </span>not <span class="gemarra-regular">fit for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eating, </span>he is exempt. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one chews </span>raw <span class="gemarra-regular">peppe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Yom Kippur, he is exempt, </span>since this is not considered eating. Similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">one chews ginger [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zangvila</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Yom Kippur, he is exempt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection</span> to this. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir would say </span>about the verse: “And when you shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit of it as forbidden [<span class="it-text">orla</span>]; three years it shall be forbidden to you, it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 19:23). <span class="gemarra-regular">From the implication of what is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: “Then you shall count the fruit of it as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forbidden,” do I not know that </span>the verse is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">“trees for food,” </span>since it uses the word “fruit”? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what </span>is the meaning when <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states “trees</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for food”? </span>It includes <span class="gemarra-regular">a tree whose wood and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fruit taste the same, </span>i.e., a tree that is itself eaten in addition to its fruit. One <span class="gemarra-regular">must say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">peppe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> that grows on a tree, <span class="gemarra-regular">to teach you that </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">pepper is subject </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">orla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And </span>this also teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz Yisrael lacks nothing, </span>as even pepper can grow there, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated </span>among the listed praises of Eretz Yisrael: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You will not lack anything in it” </span>(Deuteronomy 8:9).
In any event, it has been derived that pepper is called food, which contradicts Rava’s statement. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>statement about edible pepper is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>bell pepper, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">moist; and that </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> pertaining to Yom Kippur is referring to black pepper, which is <span class="gemarra-regular">dry </span>and is not considered food.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Mareimar: But didn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted </span>to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">cooked ginger [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">himalta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that comes from India, </span>and there is no concern that gentiles may have cooked it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we recite the blessing: Who creates the fruit of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ground, over it. </span>Apparently, ginger is edible. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: This </span>statement is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to wet </span>ginger, which is considered food; <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>earlier statement pertaining to Yom Kippur, which maintained that ginger is not food, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to dry </span>ginger. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one ate leaves </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of reeds </span>on Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is exempt, </span>but if one ate <span class="gemarra-regular">grapevine shoot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he is liable. </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are these grapevine shoots? Rabbi Yitzḥak from </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Migdal said: All </span>shoots <span class="gemarra-regular">that sprouted between Rosh </span><span class="gemarra-regular">HaShana and Yom Kippur </span>and are still very soft are considered food. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Kahana said: </span>All shoots that sprouted up to <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty days </span>before Yom Kippur are considered food. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak from Migdal: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one ate leaves of reeds he is exempt, but </span>if one ate <span class="gemarra-regular">grapevine shoots he is liable. What are these</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> grapevine shoots? </span>They are <span class="gemarra-regular">all those that sprouted between Rosh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> HaShana and Yom Kippur.</span>
It was taught in the mishna that if on Yom Kippur one <span class="gemarra-regular">drank fish brine or </span>the briny <span class="gemarra-regular">liquid </span>in which fish are pickled, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is exempt. </span>The Gemara comments: From the language of the mishna it may be inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">if one drank vinegar, he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">liable</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Who is </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna? It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Vinegar revives the spirit </span>and is therefore considered a beverage. 
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Giddel bar Menashe </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the town of <span class="gemarra-regular">Birei DeNeresh taught </span>in a public lecture that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, and vinegar is not considered a beverage. <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>next <span class="gemarra-regular">year everyone went out and mixed</span> vinegar with water <span class="gemarra-regular">and drank vinegar </span>on Yom Kippur. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Giddel heard </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">and became angry </span>with them for their actions. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said: Say that I said </span>one is not liable for drinking vinegar <span class="gemarra-regular">only after the fact; </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">did I say </span>it is permitted to drink it <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Furthermore: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say that I said </span>my statement with regard to one who drinks <span class="gemarra-regular">a little, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">did I say</span> it is permitted to drink <span class="gemarra-regular">a lot? </span>Furthermore: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I said </span>my statement in reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">pure </span>vinegar, which is very strong, <span class="gemarra-regular">but did I say </span>anything about <span class="gemarra-regular">diluted</span> vinegar? That is certainly prohibited. 

Daf 82a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the children, one does not afflict them </span>by withholding food <span class="gemarra-regular">on Yom Kippur; however, one trains them one year</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before or two years before </span>they reach majority, by means of a partial fast lasting several hours, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will be accustomed to </span>fulfill <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks about the wording of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>it is stated that one trains children <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>their maturity, is it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary to say that one trains them one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">year before? </span>This expression in the mishna is superfluous. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ḥisda said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>statement that one trains children one year before their maturity is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a feeble </span>child; <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>statement that one trains children two years before their maturity is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a healthy </span>child. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: One trains </span>a healthy child <span class="gemarra-regular">of eight </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">and nine </span>years to fast <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>several <span class="gemarra-regular">hours; </span>at <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">and eleven </span>years, <span class="gemarra-regular">they complete </span>the fast <span class="gemarra-regular">by</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> rabbinic </span>law; <span class="gemarra-regular">at twelve </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">they complete </span>the fast <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah </span>law. This applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to girls </span>who reach maturity and become obligated in mitzvot at age twelve. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Naḥman said: At nine </span>years and <span class="gemarra-regular">ten </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">one trains</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them </span>to fast <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>several <span class="gemarra-regular">hours; at eleven and twelve</span> years <span class="gemarra-regular">they complete </span>the fast <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic </span>law; <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thirteen </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">they complete </span>the fast <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah </span>law. This applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to boys. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: There is no</span> obligation with regard to children <span class="gemarra-regular">completing </span>the fast <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic</span> law. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">at ten and eleven </span>years, <span class="gemarra-regular">one trains </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>to fast <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>several <span class="gemarra-regular">hours; and at twelve </span>years girls are obligated to <span class="gemarra-regular">complete </span>their fast <span class="gemarra-regular">by Torah </span>law.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the children, one does not afflict </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>by withholding food <span class="gemarra-regular">on Yom Kippur; however, one trains </span><span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">one year before or two </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>they reach maturity. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>this makes sense according to the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna and Rav Naḥman, </span>who hold that for one or two years before reaching maturity there is a rabbinic law requiring children to complete the fast. The mishna that states <span class="gemarra-regular">one year before or two </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>should be understood as follows: A feeble child is obligated to complete the fast on Yom Kippur in the <span class="gemarra-regular">year before</span> reaching maturity <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic </span>law, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a healthy child is obligated to complete the fast on Yom Kippur in the <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>reaching maturity <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic </span>law (Vilna Gaon). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yoḥanan, </span>who holds that there is no rabbinic law to complete the fast, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. </span>In his opinion, what is the difference between one year before and two years before? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">one year or two </span>years? One year is referring not to the year before the year preceding their maturity, i.e. the two years preceding it, but actually to the year <span class="gemarra-regular">preceding their maturity. </span>The phrase: One or two years, indicates that there is a difference between those who are required for one year and those who required for two, which depends on their health: The healthy child is required to fast two years, but one year is sufficient for a feeble child.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Shmuel taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">children, one does not afflict them </span>by withholding food <span class="gemarra-regular">on Yom Kippur; however, one trains them one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">year </span>for a feeble child <span class="gemarra-regular">or two </span>years for a healthy child <span class="gemarra-regular">preceding their maturity. Granted, </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan, this works out well; but </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Huna and Rav Naḥman, </span>who say that there is an additional year that one is required to complete the fast according to rabbinic law, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you: What is </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">training that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is also taught </span>there? It is referring to fasting <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">complete </span>day, which is required by rabbinic law. By rabbinic law, the time of completing the fast for a healthy child is two years before he reaches maturity. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is training called </span><span class="gemarra-regular">completion? </span>Doesn’t training mean that the child performs only part of the mitzva? <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>explicitly in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is training? If </span>the child <span class="gemarra-regular">was accustomed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to eat </span>every day <span class="gemarra-regular">at the second </span>hour of the day, <span class="gemarra-regular">one feeds him at the third </span>hour, so he will begin to understand the concept of affliction. If he was accustomed to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">at the third </span>hour, <span class="gemarra-regular">one feeds</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him at the fourth </span>hour. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava bar Ulla said: </span>This is not difficult; <span class="gemarra-regular">these are two </span>different types of <span class="gemarra-regular">training. </span>There is training of small children to wait slightly longer before eating, and training of older children, in which one habituates them to fasting a full day.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a pregnant woman who smelled </span>food and was overcome by a craving to eat it, <span class="gemarra-regular">one feeds her until</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> she recovers, </span>as failure to do so could lead to a life-threatening situation. If a person is <span class="gemarra-regular">ill </span>and requires food due to potential danger, <span class="gemarra-regular">one feeds him according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the advice of medical <span class="gemarra-regular">experts </span>who determine that he indeed requires food. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if there are no experts there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, one feeds him according to his own </span>instructions, <span class="gemarra-regular">until he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says </span>that he has eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">enough </span>and needs no more.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a pregnant woman who smelled</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> consecrated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or pig meat </span>and craved those specific foods, <span class="gemarra-regular">one inserts a thin </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">into the juice </span>of that item <span class="gemarra-regular">and places it on her mouth. If her</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mind become settled </span>with that, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is well. And if</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not, one feeds her the gravy itself </span>of that forbidden food. <span class="gemarra-regular">If her mind becomes settled </span>with that, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is well. And if not, one feeds her the fat </span>of the forbidden food <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, as there is no </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that stands in the way of saving a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>the prohibitions against <span class="gemarra-regular">idol worship, and forbidden sexual </span><span class="gemarra-regular">relationships, and bloodshed.</span>
The Gemara clarifies: With regard to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">idol worship </span>takes precedence over saving one’s life, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>derive this? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: If it is stated: </span>“And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, <span class="gemarra-regular">and with all your soul” </span>(Deuteronomy 6:5), <span class="gemarra-regular">why</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is it stated </span>in the continuation of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">And with all your might” </span>(Deuteronomy 6:5)? <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated: “With all your might,” why is it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated: “With all your soul”? </span>One of these statements appears to be superfluous.
Rather, it is to teach that <span class="gemarra-regular">if there is a person </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whose body is more beloved to him than his property, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">therefore it is stated: “With all your soul.” </span>The verse teaches that one must be willing to sacrifice his life to sanctify God’s name. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if there is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a person whose property is more beloved to him than </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his body</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> therefore it is stated: “With all your </span><span class="gemarra-regular">might.” </span>Rabbi Eliezer understands the phrase “with all your might” to mean: With all your possessions. Therefore, one must be prepared to forfeit his life rather than be saved through idol worship. 
§ With regard to the concept that one must surrender his life rather than have <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sexual relations or shed blood </span>through murder, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>derive this? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>It is stated about the rape of a betrothed woman: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For as when </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a man rises against his fellow and slays him, even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so is this matter” </span>(Deuteronomy 22:26). One might ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">What</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> idea did we learn about a betrothed woman from a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> murderer? </span>The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a betrothed woman is clear; what new point is learned by comparing it to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a murderer? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> about the murderer, which appears to <span class="gemarra-regular">come to teach </span>about the betrothed woman, <span class="gemarra-regular">is found to </span>actually be the <span class="gemarra-regular">subject of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teaching. </span>The inference is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the betrothed woman, </span>permission is <span class="gemarra-regular">given to save </span><span class="gemarra-regular">her at </span>the cost of the <span class="gemarra-regular">life of </span>her attacker, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">murderer </span>may be saved from committing the crime at the cost of his life, i.e., one may save the victim by killing the attacker. Another teaching is derived in the opposite direction, from the case of murder to the case of rape. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">murderer </span>is subject to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">let him be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">killed, and let him not transgress, </span>i.e., one must even allow himself to be killed rather than take the life of another, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>a man must surrender his life rather than engage in forbidden sexual relations with <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> betrothed young woman. </span>By inference, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">let him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be killed, and let him not transgress, </span>applies to all forbidden sexual relations. 

Daf 82b

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">murderer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> himself, from where </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>derive this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that he should be killed rather than transgress the prohibition against murder? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>derived through <span class="gemarra-regular">reason, </span>as it was told: <span class="gemarra-regular">A certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rava. He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">The master of the village </span>where I live <span class="gemarra-regular">said to me: Kill so-and-so, and if </span>you do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will kill you. </span>What should I do? Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Let yourself be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> killed, and you should not kill. </span>Rava reasoned: <span class="gemarra-regular">What did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you see </span>to make you think <span class="gemarra-regular">that your blood is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> redde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> and more important than his? <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps the blood </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of that man is redder, </span>and he is more important than you. If so, it is logical that one must not kill another person to save himself.
§ With respect to a pregnant woman who smells food, it is told: <span class="gemarra-regular">A certain pregnant </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woman smelled </span>a food and craved it. Those involved <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi to ask how to proceed. <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to those </span>who were inquiring: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go and whisper to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that today is Yom Kippur. They whispered to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">her, and this whispering helped; </span>she stopped craving the food. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">read </span>this verse <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>the baby she was carrying: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Before I formed yo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">u</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the belly</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I knew you, </span>and before you came forth out of the womb I sanctified you” (Jeremiah 1:5), and indeed, the baby who <span class="gemarra-regular">came out of </span>that woman was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara relates another story: <span class="gemarra-regular">A certain pregnant </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woman smelled </span>food and had a craving to eat it on Yom Kippur. Those involved <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Ḥanina </span>to ask how to proceed. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: Whisper to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> her </span>that today is Yom Kippur. They whispered to her, but <span class="gemarra-regular">she did not accept the whisper </span>and continued to crave the food. Rabbi Ḥanina <span class="gemarra-regular">read </span>this verse <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>the baby: 

Daf 83a

<span class="gemarra-regular">“The wicked</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are estranged from the womb” </span>(Psalms 58:4), i.e., it is clear they are estranged already in their mother’s womb. Indeed, <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbetai the hoarder of fruits came out </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of her. </span>He hoarded fruit during years of famine in order to inflate its price and profit at the expense of poor people.
§ It was taught in the mishna: If a person is <span class="gemarra-regular">ill </span>and requires food due to potential danger, <span class="gemarra-regular">one feeds him according to</span> the advice of medical <span class="gemarra-regular">experts. Rabbi Yannai said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">an ill person says </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">needs </span>to eat, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> doctor says he does not need </span>to eat, <span class="gemarra-regular">one listens</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the ill person</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? It is because the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">heart knows the bitterness of its soul” </span>(Proverbs 14:10), meaning an ill person knows the intensity of his pain and weakness, and doctors cannot say otherwise. The Gemara asks: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that a person knows himself better than anyone else does. Why does this need to be stated explicitly? The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> doctor is more certain </span>because he has had more experience with this condition. Therefore, the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that even so, it is the ill person who knows his own suffering better than anyone else. 
However, in the opposite case, if <span class="gemarra-regular">a doctor says </span>that the ill person <span class="gemarra-regular">needs </span>food, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the ill person </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">says he does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">need </span>to eat, <span class="gemarra-regular">one listens to the doctor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">What </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is the reason </span>for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? It is because <span class="gemarra-regular">confusion [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tunba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has taken hold </span>of the ill person on account of his illness, and his judgment is impaired. Consequently, he himself does not know how much he needs food. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: If a person is <span class="gemarra-regular">ill, one feeds him according to </span>the advice of medical <span class="gemarra-regular">experts. </span>This implies that if there are experts present, then <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the advice of <span class="gemarra-regular">experts, yes, </span>one feeds the ill person; but at <span class="gemarra-regular">his own </span>instructions, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>one does not feed him, contrary to Rabbi Yannai’s opinion. It further implies that <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the advice of several <span class="gemarra-regular">experts, yes, </span>one feeds an ill person; however, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the advice of only <span class="gemarra-regular">one expert, no, </span>one does not feed him. There appears to be a requirement for at least two doctors, which also contradicts Rabbi Yannai’s opinion that the opinion of one expert is sufficient to override the opinion of the ill person. 
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a unique circumstance: The ill person <span class="gemarra-regular">says I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do not need </span>food, and the consultation of experts is required. The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">But let them feed him according </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the advice of <span class="gemarra-regular">one expert, </span>as Rabbi Yannai said that in such a circumstance one feeds the ill person based on the advice of one doctor. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the requirement of two experts is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is another, </span>third expert <span class="gemarra-regular">with him who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says </span>that the ill person <span class="gemarra-regular">does not need </span>to eat. In such a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">one feeds </span>the ill person <span class="gemarra-regular">according</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the advice of two <span class="gemarra-regular">experts </span>who agree that he requires it. 
The Gemara asks: If so, this is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>concerning a <span class="gemarra-regular">life</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-threatening </span>situation, and in all cases of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>concerning a <span class="gemarra-regular">life-threatening </span>situation, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is lenient. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there are two other </span>doctors who, along <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the ill person, <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not need </span>food. <span class="gemarra-regular">And although </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Safra said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">are like one hundre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one hundred </span>witnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">are like two </span>witnesses, <span class="gemarra-regular">that rule applies </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">to the matter of testimony; however, </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">matter of assessing </span>a situation, <span class="gemarra-regular">we follow </span>the majority of <span class="gemarra-regular">opinions. </span>Therefore, one might think in this case that the ill person should not be fed because the opinion of two doctors plus the ill person should override the opposing opinion of two other doctors.
Generally speaking, two or more witnesses constitute complete testimony, and there is no difference between the testimony of two and the testimony of a large number of people. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, this </span>principle of following the majority <span class="gemarra-regular">applies </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">to assessing monetary </span>issues, <span class="gemarra-regular">but here </span>it is a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>concerning a <span class="gemarra-regular">life-threatening </span>situation. Therefore, although it is the opinion of two doctors against the opinion of two doctors and the ill person, the ill person must eat.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> latter clause </span>of the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">if there are no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> experts present one feeds him according to his own opinion</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, by inference, the first clause </span>of the mishna is referring to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the ill person said he needs</span> to eat. In that case, the mishna states that one follows the experts’ opinion, not his own, and feeds him. The Gemara answers: The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete and is teaching</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the following: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement </span>that he may eat only based on the advice of experts <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It is when the ill person <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not need </span>to eat. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: I do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">need </span>to eat, and <span class="gemarra-regular">instead of two experts there is</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not need </span>to eat, <span class="gemarra-regular">one feeds him according to his own opinion.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar bar Rav Ashi said: Any </span>instance <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>an ill person <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I need </span>to eat, <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if there are one hundred </span>expert doctors <span class="gemarra-regular">who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not need </span>to eat, <span class="gemarra-regular">we listen to his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> own </span>opinion and feed him, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> heart knows the bitterness of its soul” </span>(Proverbs 14:10).
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>an ill person himself says he needs to eat and <span class="gemarra-regular">there are no experts present, one feeds him according to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his own opinion. </span>This implies that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>one feeds him <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">there are no experts </span>present. One may infer from this that if <span class="gemarra-regular">there were experts </span>present, <span class="gemarra-regular">no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one would not feed the ill person based on his own opinion but would instead listen to the advice of the experts. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement </span>that one follows the opinion of the experts <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the ill person <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I do not need </span>to eat. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: I do need </span>to eat, it is considered as if <span class="gemarra-regular">there were no </span><span class="gemarra-regular">experts there at all; we feed him based on his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">opinion, as it is stated: “The heart knows the bitterness</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of its soul” </span>(Proverbs 14:10). All the experts are ignored in the face of the ill person’s own sensitivities. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is seized </span>with the life-threatening illness <span class="gemarra-italic">bulmos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> causing him unbearable hunger pangs and impaired vision, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">feed him even impure </span><span class="gemarra-regular">foods </span>on Yom Kippur or any other day <span class="gemarra-regular">until his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eyes recover, </span>as the return of his sight indicates that he is recovering. In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one whom a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mad dog bit, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not feed him from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lobe of </span>the dog’s <span class="gemarra-regular">liver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This was thought to be a remedy for the bite, but the Rabbis deem it ineffective. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Matya ben Ḥarash permits </span>feeding it to him, as he deems it effective.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Matya ben Ḥarash said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who suffers</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pain in his throat, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">place medicin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> inside </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his mouth on Shabbat, </span>although administering a remedy is prohibited on Shabbat. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>whether or not it is a <span class="gemarra-regular">life-threatening </span>situation for him, as it is difficult to ascertain the severity of internal pain. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>concerning a <span class="gemarra-regular">life-threatening </span>situation <span class="gemarra-regular">overrides Shabbat. </span>
Similarly, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one upon whom a rockslide fell, </span>and there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">he is ther</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> under the debris or whether <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not there; and </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty</span> whether he is still <span class="gemarra-regular">alive </span>or whether he is <span class="gemarra-regular">dead; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>whether the person under the debris is <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile </span>or whether he is <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew, one clears</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the pile </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">atop him. </span>One may perform any action necessary to rescue him from beneath the debris. If <span class="gemarra-regular">they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> found him alive </span>after beginning to clear the debris, <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>continue to <span class="gemarra-regular">clear </span>the pile until they can extricate him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>they found him <span class="gemarra-regular">dead, they </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">leave </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him, </span>since one may not desecrate Shabbat to preserve the dignity of the dead.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: From where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would they know that his eyes had recovered </span>their sight? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">from when he can discern between good and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bad </span>food, since under the influence of <span class="it-text">bulmos</span> one eats food indiscriminately. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">with tasting. </span>When he can distinguish the tastes of different foods his eyesight must have also recovered. For example, at night, although it is dark, the sign that his eyesight has been restored is that he is able to detect difference in tastes (<span class="it-text">Me’iri</span>). 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is seized </span>with <span class="gemarra-italic">bulmos</span> and must be fed until his vision is restored, <span class="gemarra-regular">one feeds him the </span>items whose prohibition is <span class="gemarra-regular">least </span>severe first. If he must be fed forbidden foods, he should first be fed those whose level of prohibition is least severe. For instance, if there is <span class="gemarra-regular">untithed produce </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">an unslaughtered animal carcass [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">neveila</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>or any other non-kosher meat, <span class="gemarra-regular">one feeds him</span> the <span class="gemarra-italic">neveila</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as the prohibition of untithed produced warrants death at the hand of Heaven, but eating non-kosher meat is a transgression punishable only by lashes. If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">untithed produce and </span>produce from the <span class="gemarra-regular">Sabbatical Year, </span>he is fed the produce from the <span class="gemarra-regular">Sabbatical Year. </span>Untithed produce warrants death at the hand of Heaven, whereas the produce of a Sabbatical Year is prohibited by a positive mitzva and there is no punishment associated with it. 
If they have <span class="gemarra-regular">untithed produce and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span> as to which food they should feed him, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One feeds him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> untithed produce and does not feed him </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Ben Teima</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: </span>It is better to feed him <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>feed him <span class="gemarra-regular">untithed produce. Rabba said: Where it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">possible </span>to feed <span class="gemarra-regular">him non-sacred foo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> by separating tithes from untithed produce and thereby rendering the remainder permitted, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> agrees that one should make </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">fit </span>for consumption by separating tithes <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">feed </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, </span>even on Shabbat, when it is otherwise prohibited to separate tithes. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they disagree, </span>it is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> impossible </span>to feed him <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred food </span>because there is no way to separate tithes. <span class="gemarra-regular">One Sage holds </span>that the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">untithed produce is more severe; and one Sage</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is more severe. </span>The two sides reason as follows. One <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage holds that </span>the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">untithed produce is </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">severe </span>because it is prohibited to everyone; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is fit for a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">priest, </span>and therefore one could say that its prohibition is less severe. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one Sage holds that </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>more <span class="gemarra-regular">severe </span>because non-priests may never eat it, <span class="gemarra-regular">while untithed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> produce can be made fit </span>to eat, and therefore, even while it is still untithed, the prohibition against eating it is less severe. 

Daf 83b

It was stated that, according to Rabba, if <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is possible </span>to make the untithed produce fit and then feed him <span class="gemarra-regular">with non-sacred </span>food, one should do so. The Gemara is surprised at this: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that if it is possible to tithe the produce and feed him that, one should do so. Why must it be stated? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state this with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat, </span>when it is generally prohibited to separate <span class="it-text">terumot</span> and tithes. Even so, the Sages said that it is better to separate <span class="it-text">terumot</span> and tithes on Shabbat rather than feed the ill person untithed produce. 
The Gemara asks: With regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to Shabbat </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">also obvious, </span>since the prohibition against separating <span class="it-text">terumot</span> and tithes is merely a prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">moving, </span>which is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic </span>law. That is certainly less severe than the prohibition against eating untithed produce. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with fruits grown in <span class="gemarra-regular">an imperforate container</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which are not subject to <span class="it-text">teruma</span> by Torah law but <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic </span>law. The Gemara teaches that it is preferable to transgress the rabbinic prohibition of tithing the fruit on Shabbat rather than feed the ill person untithed produce, although in this case the prohibition is rabbinic. 
§ The Gemara now discusses the aforementioned two opinions: <span class="gemarra-regular">One Sage, </span>ben Teima, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds that untithed produce is more severe, </span>and therefore one must tithe the fruit although it is prohibited to separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> on Shabbat; <span class="gemarra-regular">and one Sage, </span>the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">holds that </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is more severe. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that Rabba’s view <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>one side of a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it was taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one whom a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> snake bit </span>on Shabbat and who is in danger, <span class="gemarra-regular">one calls a doctor for him </span>to come <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">place to another; and one tears a chicken apart for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him </span>if he needs its meat for healing; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one harvests leeks </span>from the ground <span class="gemarra-regular">and feeds </span>them to <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>for healing purposes, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one need not separate tithes; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: He should not eat it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> unless it has been tithed.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that Rabba’s statement that one must separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes from the fruit for the ill person on Shabbat, even from untithed produce prohibited by rabbinic law, corresponds to the view of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, son of Rabbi Shimon. </span>He says that one must tithe the leeks for the ill person even on Shabbat, although leeks, like all other vegetables, are considered untithed produce only by rabbinic law. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabba’s opinion does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>follow the view of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even if you say </span>that Rabba holds in accordance with the view of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying </span>that one should not separate tithes <span class="gemarra-regular">only there, with regard to </span>the requirement to take the <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe from vegetables, </span>like leeks, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is rabbinic </span>in origin. This requirement was decreed lest one come to confuse vegetables with produce that is untithed by Torah law. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe of grains, </span>which have the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">untithed produce by Torah </span>law, although in this particular circumstance their untithed status is rabbinic because the grains grew in an imperforate container, <span class="gemarra-regular">even Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes </span>that the produce must be tithed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Because if it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is permitted for him </span>to eat without separating tithes from produce grown in <span class="gemarra-regular">an imperforate container, </span>he may err and <span class="gemarra-regular">come to eat </span>from grain grown in <span class="gemarra-regular">a perforated pot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is considered untithed produce by Torah law. Consequently, one must separate tithes on Shabbat before feeding an ill person, even according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is seized with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bulmos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, one feeds him honey and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">all types of sweet </span>foods, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the honey and all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">types of sweet </span>foods <span class="gemarra-regular">restore the sight of his eyes. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And although there is no </span>clear <span class="gemarra-regular">proof for the matter, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">there is an allusion to the matter. </span>Jonathan said: <span class="gemarra-regular">“See</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, I pray you, how my eyes are brightened because I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tasted a little of this honey” </span>(I Samuel 14:29). 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why</span> does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Although there is no </span>clear <span class="gemarra-regular">proof</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the matter, </span>when that verse is a strong proof? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>Jonathan was <span class="gemarra-regular">not seized with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bulmos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he was merely very hungry. Therefore, the episode provides no evidence that honey or sweet foods are the remedy for <span class="it-text">bulmos</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: They taught </span>that honey restores a one’s eyesight <span class="gemarra-regular">only after eating </span>other food, <span class="gemarra-regular">but before eating </span>other food <span class="gemarra-regular">it whets </span>one’s appetite, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “And they found an Egyptian man in the field, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> brought him to David, and they gave him bread and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he ate, and they gave him water to drink; and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they gave him a piece of a cake of figs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and two clusters of raisins, and he ate, and his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> spirit was restored; for he had eaten no bread nor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> drunk any water for three days and three nights” </span>(I Samuel 30:11–12). This indicates that sweets are given after the main course and not before it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is seized with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bulmos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one feeds him a sheep’s tail with honey, </span>since the combination of the fatty meat and the honey helps greatly. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: Also, fine </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wheat flour with honey </span>is a remedy. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Even barley flour with honey </span>is good for curing <span class="it-text">bulmos</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Once I was seized with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bulmos</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I ran to the east side of a fig tre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and found ripe figs there, which I ate. Figs on a tree do not all ripen at once but ripen first on the side where the sun rises, so Rabbi Yoḥanan searched first for figs on the east side of the tree. <span class="gemarra-regular">And I </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">fulfilled </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Wisdom </span><span class="gemarra-regular">preserves the lives of those who have it” </span>(Ecclesiastes 7:12). <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Yosef taught: One who wishes to taste the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> flavor of the fig should turn to the east, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is stated: “And for the precious things of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sun’s fruits” </span>(Deuteronomy 33:14), implying that the sun ripens fruit and makes them sweet. 
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei were walking on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the road </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda was seized with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bulmos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. He </span><span class="gemarra-regular">overpowered </span>a nearby <span class="gemarra-regular">shepherd and ate the bread </span>that the shepherd had in his hand, since his life was in danger. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said to him: You have robbed that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shepherd. When they reached the city, Rabbi Yosei was seized </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bulmos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and all the people of the city <span class="gemarra-regular">surrounded </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him with jugs [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lagei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and plates </span>with all sorts of sweets. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said to him </span>in jest: <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">robbed </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">the shepherd, but you have robbed the entire </span><span class="gemarra-regular">city.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>it is told: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meir and Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei were walking on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the road </span>together. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir would analyze names </span>and discern one’s nature from his name, while <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi Yosei were not </span>apt to <span class="gemarra-regular">analyze names. When</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they came to a certain place, they looked for lodging</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">were given </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said </span>to the innkeeper: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is your name? He said to them: </span>My name is <span class="gemarra-regular">Kidor. </span>Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to himself: Perhaps one can <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from this that he is a wicked person, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated: “For they are a generation [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ki</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">dor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of upheavals” </span>(Deuteronomy 32:20). Since it was Friday afternoon, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei entrusted their purses to him. Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Meir did not entrust his purse to him </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">went</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and placed it at the grave of the innkeeper’s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> father. </span>
The innkeeper’s father <span class="gemarra-regular">appeared </span>to the innkeeper <span class="gemarra-regular">in a dream </span>and said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Go take the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> purse placed at the head of that man, </span>i.e., the innkeeper’s father. <span class="gemarra-regular">The following day, he said </span>to the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">appeared to me in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> my dream. They said to him: Dreams during twilight </span>on Shabbat evening <span class="gemarra-regular">have no substance </span>and should not be trusted. Even so, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir went and guarded </span>his money <span class="gemarra-regular">all</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">day and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">took it. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The next day, </span>the rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the innkeeper: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give us our purses. He said to them: These matters</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> never occurred; </span>you never gave me any purses. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Meir said to them: Why didn’t you analyze his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">name </span>to learn that he is a wicked man? <span class="gemarra-regular">They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Why didn’t the Master tell us? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: I said one should be suspicious, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but have I said </span>a person <span class="gemarra-regular">should be established as </span>wicked? Could I say to you with certainty that he is wicked based on his name alone?
What did they do? <span class="gemarra-regular">They dragged </span>the innkeeper <span class="gemarra-regular">and brought him to a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">store </span>and gave him wine to drink. After he drank the wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">they saw lentils on his mustache, </span>showing that he had eaten lentils that day. <span class="gemarra-regular">They went and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gave this sign to his wife. </span>They said that the innkeeper had ordered that their money be returned to them upon the sign that he ate lentils at his last meal. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they took their purses </span>and went. <span class="gemarra-regular">He went</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and killed his wife </span>out of anger that she did this. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">This is as we learned </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Due to a person’s laxity in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-regular">washing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they fed </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">pork. </span>There was an innkeeper who was accustomed to feed pork to gentiles and kosher meat to Jews. He distinguished between Jews and gentiles by watching to see whether they performed the ritual hand-washing before eating. One time, a Jew came and ate without washing his hands before the meal, and the innkeeper gave him pork to eat. Laxity in <span class="gemarra-regular">the final washing, </span>the washing of one’s hands and mouth after a meal, caused the innkeeper <span class="gemarra-regular">to kill the person. </span>This is similar to that story, as had the wicked innkeeper washed his mouth, the rabbis would not have known that he had eaten lentils. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And in the end, they </span>too, Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei, <span class="gemarra-regular">would analyze names. When they came to a house </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>a landlord <span class="gemarra-regular">named Bala, they did not enter. They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Conclude from here that he is </span>certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">wicked, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “I said of her who was worn </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bala</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] by adulteries” </span>(Ezekiel 23:43), <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-regular">After I am grown old [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beloti</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] shall I have pleasure?”</span> (Genesis 18:12). “Worn out by adulteries” means <span class="gemarra-regular">aged through adulteries</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ It was taught that in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one whom a mad do</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> bit, </span>one does not feed him the lobe of its liver. The Gemara clarifies the concept of the mad dog. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Five signs were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said about a mad dog: Its mouth is </span>always <span class="gemarra-regular">open; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and its saliva drips; and its ears are floppy </span>and do not stand up; and <span class="gemarra-regular">its tail rests on its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">legs; and it walks on the edges of roads. And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">some say it also barks and its voice is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">heard. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where did </span>the dog become mad? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: Witches play with it </span>and practice their magic on it, causing it to become mad. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: An evil spirit rests upon it.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>two opinions? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a practical difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with regard to

Daf 84a

<span class="gemarra-regular">killing it with an object that is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">thrown </span>from a distance like an arrow rather than with one’s hands. If the dog is possessed by an evil spirit, one should avoid direct contact with it.
The Gemara comments: This <span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel: When one kills </span>a mad dog, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should kill it only with a thrown</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> object. </span>Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is rubbed by mad dog will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> become dangerously </span>ill, while <span class="gemarra-regular">one bitten </span>by the dog <span class="gemarra-regular">will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> die. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the remedy </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is rubbed by mad dog </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">becomes dangerously </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ill? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him take off his clothing </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and run. </span>The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehoshua, was rubbed by one of these </span>mad dogs <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the market, </span>whereupon <span class="gemarra-regular">he took off his clothing and ran. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He said: I have fulfilled </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Wisdom preserves the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lives of those who have it” </span>(Ecclesiastes 7:12). 
The Gemara continues to discuss the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One bitten </span>by a mad dog <span class="gemarra-regular">will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> die</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the remedy? Abaye</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Let him bring the skin of a male hyena</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and write on it: I, so-and-so, son of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so-and-so, am writing </span>this spell <span class="gemarra-regular">about you upon</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the skin of a male hyena: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Kanti</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kanti</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kelirus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And some say </span>he should write: <span class="gemarra-italic">Kandi</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kandi</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">keloros</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>He then writes names of God, <span class="gemarra-italic">Yah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Yah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Lord of Hosts</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, amen amen Selah. And let him take off his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">clothes and bury them in a cemetery for twelve months </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the year, </span>after which <span class="gemarra-regular">he should take them out, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and burn them in an oven, and scatter the ashes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">at a crossroads. And </span>during <span class="gemarra-regular">those twelve months </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">year, </span>when his clothes are buried, <span class="gemarra-regular">when he drinks water</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, let him drink only from a copper tub</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and not from a spring, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest he see the </span>image of the <span class="gemarra-regular">demon in the water and be endangered, like </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba bar Marta, who is </span>also called <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba bar Manyumi, whose mother made him a gold tube </span>for this purpose.
§ The mishna said: <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, Rabbi Matya </span>ben Ḥarash <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>With regard to one who suffers pain in his throat, one may place medicine inside his mouth on Shabbat, although administering a remedy is prohibited on Shabbat. The Gemara discusses a related incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan suffered </span>from the illness <span class="gemarra-italic">tzefidna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which first affects the teeth and gums and then the intestines. <span class="gemarra-regular">He went to a certain </span>gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">matron [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">matronita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> who was a well-known healer. <span class="gemarra-regular">She prepared a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">medicine for him on Thursday and Friday. He said to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">her: What </span>shall I do <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat,  </span>when I cannot come to collect the medicine from you? <span class="gemarra-regular">She said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: You will not need </span>it. He asked her: <span class="gemarra-regular">If I do need </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>shall I do? <span class="gemarra-regular">She said to him: Swear to me that you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will not reveal </span>the remedy; then I will tell you, and you can prepare it yourself should you need it. <span class="gemarra-regular">He swore: To the God of the Jews, I will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not reveal it. </span>She told him the remedy. Rabbi Yoḥanan then <span class="gemarra-regular">went out and taught it publicly, </span>revealing the secret of the remedy. 
The Gemara is surprised at this: <span class="gemarra-regular">But he swore</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to her </span>that he would not reveal it. The Gemara answers that in his vow he declared: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> reveal it to the God of the Jews. </span>However, his words imply: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will reveal it to His people, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Jews. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Still, there is a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">desecration of God’s name, </span>as the matron now thinks that a great man of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s stature broke his vow. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He revealed </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> her at the outset. </span>As soon as she revealed the remedy to him, he told her that his vow would not prevent him from publicizing the remedy. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>was the medicine that <span class="gemarra-regular">she prepared for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ami, said: </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">water</span> in which <span class="gemarra-regular">leaven </span>was steeped, <span class="gemarra-regular">olive oil, and salt. Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yeimar said: </span>It was <span class="gemarra-regular">leaven itself, olive oil, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">salt. Rav Ashi said: </span>The remedy was <span class="gemarra-regular">fat </span>from the bone marrow of <span class="gemarra-regular">a goose’s wing. Abaye said: I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">made all of these </span>medicines <span class="gemarra-regular">and was not cured </span>from this ailment, <span class="gemarra-regular">until a certain Arab told me </span>the remedy for it: <span class="gemarra-regular">Take olive seeds that are less than one-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">third </span>ripe, <span class="gemarra-regular">and burn them in a fire on top </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of a new hoe, and stick them along the row </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of gums. I did this and was cured.</span>
§ The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>disease <span class="it-text">tzefidna</span> come? It is from eating <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat bread that is too</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hot and fish remains fried in oil. What is the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sign of </span>this sickness? <span class="gemarra-regular">When one puts something between his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teeth, blood comes out from his gums. When Rabbi Yoḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> suffered from </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzefidna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he prepared this </span>medicine described above <span class="gemarra-regular">on</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shabbat and was cured. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yoḥanan prepare this </span>medicine on Shabbat for an ailment which affects only the gums but is not life-threatening? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Tzefidna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is different, since it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">begin in the mouth </span>and appears to be an illness of the teeth, <span class="gemarra-regular">but it ends up in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the intestines </span>and is dangerous.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya bar Abba said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: In accordance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">with whose </span>opinion did he do this? Was it not in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Matya ben Ḥarash, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who suffers pain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in his mouth, one puts medicine in his </span>mouth <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span>which is a minority opinion? Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: </span>It is so, <span class="gemarra-regular">but I say </span>the Sages agreed with him about taking medicine <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>case alone, <span class="gemarra-regular">but no other. </span>If so, with regard to medicine on Shabbat, the view of Rabbi Matya ben Ḥarash is not a minority opinion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Let us</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say that </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">supports him: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who is seized with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yerakon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one feeds him donkey</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> meat </span>as medicine; with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one whom a mad</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dog bit, one feeds him the lobe of its liver</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who has pain in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his mouth, one puts medicine in his </span>mouth <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; this is the statement of Rabbi Matya ben Ḥarash. And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Rabbis say: These have no </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">as a remedy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Rabbis used the term <span class="gemarra-regular">these, to exclude what</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? What, is it not to exclude </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">medicine </span>for <span class="it-text">tzefidna</span>, which the Rabbis agree is permitted on Shabbat? 
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, it excludes </span>a different remedy, which Rabbi Matya suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Bloodlettin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> to heal the ailment <span class="gemarra-italic">serunkh</span><span class="gemarra-italic">i</span> is permitted on Shabbat. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, this is reasonable </span>to say, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, said three things that he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> heard in the name of Rabbi Matya ben Ḥarash: One</span> may <span class="gemarra-regular">let blood for </span><span class="gemarra-italic">serunkhi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Shabbat; and </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one whom a mad dog bit, one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">feeds him the lobe of its liver; and </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who has pain in his mouth, one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">puts medicine in his </span>mouth <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: These </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have no </span>value <span class="gemarra-regular">as a remedy. </span>The Rabbis used the term <span class="gemarra-regular">these to exclude what? What, is it not </span>to limit their argument only to <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter two </span>items, which do not cure anything, and <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude the first </span>item, bloodletting for <span class="it-text">serunkhi</span>, which everyone agrees is an effective remedy? The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>there is no proof from here, since it is possible to say that it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the first two </span>items of the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and excludes the latter clause </span>with regard to medicine on Shabbat, which they agree with. 

Daf 84b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof for the matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabba bar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel taught </span>in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pregnant woman who smells </span>and craves food, <span class="gemarra-regular">one feeds her </span><span class="gemarra-regular">until she is satisfied, </span>even on Yom Kippur; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one whom a mad dog bit, one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> feeds him from the lobe of its liver; and </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who has pain in his mouth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, one places medicine in his </span>mouth <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who said </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabbi Matya ben </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥarash. And the Rabbis say: In this case and no </span><span class="gemarra-regular">other. </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">To which </span>case is <span class="gemarra-regular">this one</span> referring? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>they said this about <span class="gemarra-regular">a pregnant</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> woman, it </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious; is there anyone who says </span>one should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>give <span class="gemarra-regular">a pregnant woman </span>food? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not </span>referring to the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> pertaining to <span class="gemarra-regular">medicine </span>on Shabbat, which they agree is permitted? <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from this </span>that the Rabbis did not disagree about this.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>The wording of <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna is also precise </span>in accordance with this approach, as it was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">furthermore, Rabbi Matya ben Ḥarash said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who suffers pain in his mouth, one places medicine </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in his </span>mouth <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat, and the Rabbis do not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">disagree </span>with him and say otherwise. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so that the Rabbis disagree with him, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">combine </span>the two <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and teach them </span>together, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> let the Rabbis disagree </span>with both points <span class="gemarra-regular">in the latter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> clause. </span>Since the mishna was not written this way, but instead the dispute of the Rabbis appears after Rabbi Matya’s statement about the mad dog, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from here </span>that the Rabbis did not disagree with him about the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to medicine.
§ The mishna states that one with pain in his throat should be given medicine on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it is a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>concerning a <span class="gemarra-regular">life-threatening </span>situation. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need to say <span class="gemarra-regular">furthermore: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And any </span>case of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>concerning a <span class="gemarra-regular">life-threatening </span>situation <span class="gemarra-regular">overrides Shabbat? Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: They stated </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">not only </span>in a case where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but even </span>if the <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>is with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a different </span>future <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>in which uncertainty would arise as to whether or not his life will be in danger in the future? They are a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>doctors <span class="gemarra-regular">assess</span> that an ill person needs a certain treatment <span class="gemarra-regular">for eight</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> days, and the first day </span>of his illness <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat. Lest you say: He should wait until evening </span>and begin his treatment after Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">so they will not need </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to desecrate two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for his sake, </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us </span>that one must immediately desecrate Shabbat for his sake. This is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, despite the fact that an additional Shabbat will be desecrated as a result, because there is uncertainty about whether his life is in danger. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">That was also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">heats water for an ill person on Shabbat, whether to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">give him to drink or to wash him, </span>since it might help him recover. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they did not say </span>it is permitted to desecrate <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">current Shabbat </span>for him, <span class="gemarra-regular">but even a different, </span>future <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat. And one must not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say: Let us wait </span>and perform this labor <span class="gemarra-regular">for him </span>after Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he will get well  </span>in the meantime. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, one heats it for him immediately because any </span>case of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>concerning a <span class="gemarra-regular">life-threatening </span>situation <span class="gemarra-regular">overrides Shabbat. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is so <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>only with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>whether his life is in danger <span class="gemarra-regular">on the current Shabbat, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but even </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>with regard to danger <span class="gemarra-regular">on a different Shabbat. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And these acts should not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">be performed by gentile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or Samaritans but </span>should be done <span class="gemarra-regular">by the greatest of the Jewish people</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., their scholars, who know how to act properly. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not say: These actions </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">be performed </span>based on the advice <span class="gemarra-regular">of wome</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or Samaritans, </span>since they are not considered experts able to declare a person ill enough to override Shabbat. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>the opinions of <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> combine with an additional opinion, </span>meaning that if there is a dispute, their opinions may be considered when coming to a decision.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One engages </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">saving a life on Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one who is vigilant </span>to do so <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">praiseworthy. And one need not take permission from a court </span>but hurries to act on his own. <span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one sees a child who fell into the sea, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">spreads </span>a fisherman’s <span class="gemarra-regular">net and raises him </span>from the water. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one who is vigilant </span>and acts quickly <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">praiseworthy, and one need not seek permission from a court, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">although </span>in doing so<span class="gemarra-regular"> he catches fish </span>in the net as well. Similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">one sees a child fall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">into a pit </span>and the child cannot get out, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">digs part of the ground out </span>around the edge of the pit to create a makeshift step <span class="gemarra-regular">and raises him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">out. And one who is vigilant </span>and acts quickly <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">praiseworthy, and one need not seek permission from a court,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> although in doing so he fashions a step. </span>
Similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">one sees that a door is locked before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a child </span>and the child is scared and crying, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">breaks the door and takes the child out. And one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who is vigilant </span>and acts quickly <span class="gemarra-regular">is praiseworthy, and one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">need not seek permission from a court, although he intends</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to break </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">into boards </span>to be used later. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">extinguish a fire </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">placing a barrie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> of metal or clay vessels filled with water <span class="gemarra-regular">in front </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat </span>when life is endangered. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who is vigilant </span>and acts quickly <span class="gemarra-regular">is praiseworthy, and one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> need not seek permission from a court, although he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">leaves the coals</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which can be used for cooking after Shabbat.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach these examples, since each one suggests an original idea. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, had it taught </span><span class="gemarra-regular">us </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the child who fell into <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sea, </span>we would have said: He must act quickly in that case <span class="gemarra-regular">because in the meantime, </span>if he delays, the child <span class="gemarra-regular">will be swept away </span>by the waves and disappear, and therefore the rescuer need not seek permission; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>in the case of a child who fell into <span class="gemarra-regular">a pit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, who remains </span>there and is in no further danger, one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>the rescuer need not hurry but should request permission from the court first. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to tell us that case, too.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if it had taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> us the </span>case of the <span class="gemarra-regular">pit, </span>one might have thought it is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the child is scared </span>at being trapped; <span class="gemarra-regular">but when a door is locked </span>before a child, <span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is possible to sit on the other side </span>of the door and amuse him <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the sound of <span class="gemarra-regular">nuts </span>until Shabbat is over. Therefore, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach that in this case, too, one does not delay but acts immediately because a life is possibly in danger. 
It was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">extinguish a fire </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">placing a barrier </span>in front of it on Shabbat. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">this? </span>What new point is taught by this additional case of a life-endangering situation? The Gemara answers: This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the fire is spreading <span class="gemarra-regular">toward another courtyard. </span>Not only may this be done to save the lives of people in the courtyard on fire; it may also be done to prevent the fire from spreading to an adjacent courtyard.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">saving a life, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not follow the majorit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> as they do in other areas of <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? </span>When does one not follow the majority? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that one does not follow the majority in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">there are nine Jews and one gentile among them </span>and a building collapses on one of them, then in that case <span class="gemarra-regular">the majority </span>of people are <span class="gemarra-regular">Jews </span>and yet one desecrates Shabbat to save the trapped person. In such a case one is in fact following the majority. Alternatively, if the group is <span class="gemarra-regular">half Jews and half gentiles, </span>the ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">lenient </span>with regard to a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty</span> concerning a <span class="gemarra-regular">life-threatening </span>situation. But this, too, is not a case where one follows the minority, as there is an even chance that the victim is a Jew.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is referring to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">there are nine gentiles and one Jew. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">this too </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious. </span>One saves the trapped individual because the group is in a <span class="gemarra-regular">fixed </span>location, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there is a principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">whenever </span>a group is in <span class="gemarra-regular">a fixed</span> location <span class="gemarra-regular">it is considered </span>as though it were evenly divided. In this case, despite the fact that the group’s majority is gentile, it is considered as though it were composed <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of Jews and <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>of gentiles.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach that one does not follow the majority in a case where one individual did not remain with the group in their courtyard but <span class="gemarra-regular">separated </span>and went <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> another courtyard, </span>and a building collapses on him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you say: </span>One should follow the principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">whatever is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> separated </span>from a group <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered to have left from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the majority, </span>and since there was a majority of gentiles there the individual who left the group was probably a gentile, and it is not necessary to clear the debris for a gentile on Shabbat, therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches us </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that with regard to </span>uncertainty in a situation of <span class="gemarra-regular">saving </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a life, one does not follow the majority.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rav Asi say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>If there are <span class="gemarra-regular">nine gentiles and one Jew </span>and a building collapses on one of them, if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that same courtyard one removes the debris, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">in another</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> courtyard one does not remove the debris? </span>The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult; </span>there is no contradiction between the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>case, where one removes the debris, is <span class="gemarra-regular">when</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they all left </span>for another courtyard and it is clear that the Jew was among them. Consequently, the principle of being in a fixed location still applies, and it is considered a case of uncertainty. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>other situation is <span class="gemarra-regular">when</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">a minority of them left </span>for the other courtyard, and it is unknown whether the Jew left with them.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did Shmuel </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this, </span>that one does not follow the majority with regard to saving a life? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">finds an abandoned child </span>in a city and his parents are unknown, <span class="gemarra-regular">if the majority </span>of the city <span class="gemarra-regular">are gentiles </span>the child is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile; and if the majority </span>of the city <span class="gemarra-regular">are Jews </span>the child is considered a <span class="gemarra-regular">Jew; </span>if the city is composed of <span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>gentiles <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">half </span>Jews, the child is considered a <span class="gemarra-regular">Jew? And Rav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: They taught this, </span>that he is a Jew, <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with respect <span class="gemarra-regular">to sustaining him but not </span>with respect <span class="gemarra-regular">to attributing a lineage to him. </span>One does not say that he is definitely Jewish based on the majority. Therefore, with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of marriage, his status remains uncertain. If the abandoned child is a girl, she is not permitted to marry a priest, who may marry only a woman of certain lineage. 

Daf 85a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said:</span> This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of the status of a found child is with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">removing debris from on top of him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>implying that if there is a majority of gentiles in the city where he is found, one does not violate Shabbat by removing the debris from the child to save his life. This implies that one does follow the majority in the case of saving a life. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel was stated, it was stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to the first </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>. Shmuel’s intent was to be lenient, and his statement should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the majority are gentiles, he is a gentile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Shmuel said: But with regard to the matter of saving</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a life it is not so. </span>Rather, one saves him based on the uncertainty.
§ It was taught that <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a majority of gentiles </span>in the city, a foundling is considered to have the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gentile. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">To what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> does this statement relate? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>It relates <span class="gemarra-regular">to feeding him non-kosher </span>food. One need not protect the child from every prohibition and may even feed him non-kosher food, as though he were a gentile. It was further taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a majority of Jews, he is a Jew. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">To what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> does this relate? The Gemara answers: It relates <span class="gemarra-regular">to returning a lost object to him.</span> In such a case it is assumed that he is definitely a Jew. Consequently, Jews must return lost objects to him, whereas there is no obligation to return lost objects to gentiles. 
It was further stated: If the city is <span class="gemarra-regular">half</span> gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">and half </span>Jewish, the foundling has the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">To what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> does this relate? <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: </span>It is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">damages</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that our ox, </span>i.e., an ox belonging to another Jew, <span class="gemarra-regular">gored his ox, </span>one could ask: How can he make a claim like a Jew? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him bring proof </span>that he is Jewish, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>only then may he <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>the money for damages, since the burden of proof rests upon the claimant. Since he cannot prove his Jewish status, he has no claim.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary when his </span>innocuous <span class="gemarra-regular">ox, </span>which has gored fewer than three times, <span class="gemarra-regular">gored our ox,</span> i.e., an ox belonging to a Jew, in which case <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives him half, </span>which is what a Jew pays for damages caused by an innocuous ox. However, a gentile must make full restitution for the damage caused. The foundling does not pay <span class="gemarra-regular">the other half, </span>which a gentile gives to a Jew if his ox harms a Jew’s ox. <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say to </span>the one who suffered the damage: <span class="gemarra-regular">Bring proo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that I am not a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Jew and take </span>the money. In that case, the burden of proof rests upon the one who suffered the damage.
§ It was taught in the mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one upon whom a rockslide fell, </span>and there is uncertainty whether he is there under the debris or whether he is not there; and there is uncertainty whether he is still alive or whether he is dead; and there is uncertainty whether the person under the debris is a gentile or whether he is Jew, one clears the pile from atop him. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">saying? </span>Why does it bring three different uncertainties to illustrate the principle that one violates Shabbat to save a life even in a case of uncertainty?
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is speaking </span>using the style of: <span class="gemarra-regular">Needless to say, </span>and the mishna should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Needless to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say, </span>in a case where it is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is there or not there, </span>one removes the debris, since <span class="gemarra-regular">if he is </span>there and he is <span class="gemarra-regular">alive, one </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">clear </span>the debris. <span class="gemarra-regular">But even </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain </span>whether he is <span class="gemarra-regular">alive or dead, one </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">clear </span>the debris. <span class="gemarra-regular">And needless to say, </span>when there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>whether he is <span class="gemarra-regular">alive or dead, </span>but it is certain that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew, </span>one must clear the debris. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one must <span class="gemarra-regular">clear </span>the debris <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty</span> whether <span class="gemarra-regular">he is a gentile or a Jew. </span>
§ The mishna taught: If <span class="gemarra-regular">they found him alive, they </span>continue to <span class="gemarra-regular">remove </span>the debris. The Gemara is surprised at this: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they find him alive, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that they remove the debris, since that is saving a life. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to teach that one must desecrate Shabbat for his sake <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if it is clear that he will <span class="gemarra-regular">live </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a short whil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and will die soon after. 
§ The mishna taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>they found him <span class="gemarra-regular">dead, they </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">leave him. </span>The Gemara is surprised at this: Isn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">this also obvious? </span>What allowance might there be to desecrate Shabbat for the sake of a corpse? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this ruling is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Lakish, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not save a corpse from a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fire, </span>since one may not violate Shabbat for the sake of the dead. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda ben Lakish said: I heard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">save a corpse from a fire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara challenges: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even Rabbi Yehuda ben Lakish said this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only </span>with regard to a fire <span class="gemarra-regular">because a person is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> agitated over his dead </span>relative, whose body might burn in the fire. <span class="gemarra-regular">If you do not permit him </span>to remove the corpse <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">come to extinguish </span>the fire and transgress a severe Torah prohibition. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, here, </span>in the case of a rockslide or building collapse, <span class="gemarra-regular">if you do </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not permit him </span>to remove the debris, <span class="gemarra-regular">what might he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do? </span>In this case, there is no concern of Shabbat desecration, and preserving the dignity of the dead does not override Shabbat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Rabbis taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>If a person is buried under a collapsed building, <span class="gemarra-regular">until what point does one check </span>to clarify whether the victim is still alive? Until what point is he allowed to continue clearing the debris? They said: One clears <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the victim’s <span class="gemarra-regular">nose. </span>If there is no sign of life, i.e., if he is not breathing, he is certainly dead. <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say: </span>One clears <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the victim’s <span class="gemarra-regular">heart </span>to check for a heartbeat. If several people are buried and <span class="gemarra-regular">one checked and found the upper </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ones </span>under the debris <span class="gemarra-regular">dead, he should not say: The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lower ones are </span>likely also <span class="gemarra-regular">already dead, </span>and there is no point in continuing to search. <span class="gemarra-regular">There was an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">incident where they found the upper ones dead and the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lower ones alive. </span>
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that </span>the dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span> who disagree about checking for signs of life <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>the dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span> who disagree about the formation of the fetus. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">From what point is the fetus created? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">from its head, as it is stated: “You are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He Who took me [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gozi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] out of my mother’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">womb” </span>(Psalms 71:6), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it says: “Cut off [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gozi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> hair, and cast it away” </span>(Jeremiah 7:29). These verses suggest that one is created from the head, the place of the hair. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Shaul says: </span>A person is created <span class="gemarra-regular">from his navel, and he sends his roots in every</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> direction </span>until he attains the image of a person. The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who says that the presence of life is determined based on the nose holds in accordance with the opinion of the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who maintains that the formation of a fetus begins with its head. Likewise, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who says the presence of life is determined based on the heart holds in accordance with the opinion of the one who thinks the formation of a fetus begins with its navel.
The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the formation of a fetus from the navel is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abba Shaul, </span>he may nevertheless require one to check the nose for signs of life. <span class="gemarra-regular">Until now, Abba Shaul spoke there only about</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> formation, </span>saying <span class="gemarra-regular">that everything is created from its middle; however</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as for saving a life, even Abba Shaul admits that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the main </span>sign of <span class="gemarra-regular">life is in the nose, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is written: “All in whose nostrils was the breath</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the spirit of life” </span>(Genesis 7:22). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>with regard to how far to check for signs of life applies when the digger begins removing the rubble <span class="gemarra-regular">from below, </span>starting with the feet, <span class="gemarra-regular">to above. </span>In such a case it is insufficient to check until his heart; rather, one must continue removing rubble until he is able to check his nose for breath. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if one cleared the rubble <span class="gemarra-regular">from above to below, once he checked </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as far as </span>the victim’s <span class="gemarra-regular">nose he is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">required </span>to check further, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “All in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life” </span>(Genesis 7:22).
§ The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">It once </span><span class="gemarra-regular">happened that Rabbi Yishmael, and Rabbi Akiva, and Rabbi Elazar </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ben Azarya </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">walking on the road, and Levi HaSada</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, </span>were <span class="gemarra-regular">walking </span>respectfully <span class="gemarra-regular">behind them, </span>since they were younger and did not walk alongside their teachers. <span class="gemarra-regular">This question was asked before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that saving a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> overrides Shabbat?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael answered and said </span>that it is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a thief be found breaking in </span>and be struck so that he dies, there shall be no blood-guiltiness for him” (Exodus 22:1). <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, if this </span>is true for the thief, <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is uncertainty whether he comes </span>to take <span class="gemarra-regular">money </span>or to take <span class="gemarra-regular">lives, </span>and it is known that <span class="gemarra-regular">bloodshed renders the land impure, </span>since it is stated about a murderer: “And you shall not defile the land” (Numbers 35:34), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it causes the Divine Presence to depart </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from the Jewish people, </span>as the verse continues: “In the midst of which I dwell, for I the Lord dwell in the midst of the children of Israel” (Numbers 35:34), and even so the home owner <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to save</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> himself at the cost of </span>the thief’s <span class="gemarra-regular">life, </span>then <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> saving a life overrides Shabbat. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva answered </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and said </span>that it is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And if a man</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> comes purposefully upon his neighbor </span>to slay him with guile, <span class="gemarra-regular">you shall take him from My altar, that he may</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> die” </span>(Exodus 21:14). The phrase “take him <span class="gemarra-regular">from My </span><span class="gemarra-regular">altar” </span>implies that if the murderer is a priest and comes to perform the service, one does not wait for him to do so but takes him to his execution immediately. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>one should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>take him <span class="gemarra-regular">from on top </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of My altar. </span>If he already began the service and is in the midst of it, one does not take him down from the altar immediately but instead allows him to finish his service. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They taught only </span>that a priest is not removed from the altar <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to execut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> him for murder, 

Daf 85b

<span class="gemarra-regular">but to preserve a life, </span>e.g., if the priest can testify to the innocence of one who is sentenced to death, one removes him <span class="gemarra-regular">even from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on top of My altar, </span>even while he is sacrificing an offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as this </span>priest, about whom <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is uncertainty whether there is substance to his words </span>of testimony <span class="gemarra-regular">or whether there is no substance to his words, </span>is taken from the Temple service in order to save a life, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service overrides Shabbat, </span>so too, <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, saving a life overrides Shabbat. Rabbi Elazar </span>ben Azarya <span class="gemarra-regular">answered and said: Just as </span>the mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">of circumcision</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which </span>rectifies only <span class="gemarra-regular">one of the 248 limbs of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> body, overrides Shabbat, </span>so too, <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>saving <span class="gemarra-regular">one’</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s whole body, </span>which is entirely involved in mitzvot, <span class="gemarra-regular">overrides</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shabbat.</span>
Other <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> debated this same issue. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, says </span>that<span class="gemarra-regular"> it</span> is stated: “But <span class="gemarra-regular">keep my </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Exodus 31:13). One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that this applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to everyone</span> in all circumstances; therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states “but,” </span>a term that restricts and <span class="gemarra-regular">qualifies. </span>It implies that there are circumstances where one must keep Shabbat and circumstances where one must desecrate it, i.e., to save a life. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Yosef says </span>that<span class="gemarra-regular"> it</span> is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sacred to you” </span>(Exodus 31:14). This implies that Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">is given into your hands, and you are not given</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to it </span>to die on account of Shabbat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Menasya said: </span>It is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the children of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Israel shall keep Shabbat, </span>to observe Shabbat” (Exodus 31:16).<span class="gemarra-regular">The Torah said: Desecrate one Shabbat on his behalf so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he will observe many </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: If I would </span>have been <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>among those Sages who debated this question, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would have said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">my</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> proof is preferable to theirs, </span>as it states: “You shall keep My statutes and My ordinances, which a person shall do <span class="gemarra-regular">and live by them” </span>(Leviticus 18:5), <span class="gemarra-regular">and not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that he </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">die by them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In all circumstances, one must take care not to die as a result of fulfilling the mitzvot.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>commented on this: <span class="gemarra-regular">All</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of these </span>arguments <span class="gemarra-regular">have refutations except for </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, which has no refutation. </span>The Gemara explains Rava’s claim: The proof brought <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rabbi Yishmael </span>from the thief who breaks in could <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>be refuted based on the principle <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: What is the reason </span>for the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>the thief who <span class="gemarra-regular">breaks in? </span>There is <span class="gemarra-regular">a presumption </span>that while <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>is being robbed he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not restrain himself with respect to his money. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>thief <span class="gemarra-regular">knows that </span>the homeowner <span class="gemarra-regular">will rise to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">oppose him </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to himself from the start: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he rises against me, I will kill him. And the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah states: </span>If a person <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to kill you, rise </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to kill him first. We found </span>a source for saving a life that is in <span class="gemarra-regular">certain </span>danger, but <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do we </span>derive that even in a case where there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>as to whether a life is in danger one may desecrate Shabbat? Consequently, Rabbi Yishmael’s argument is refuted.
The proof <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Akiva </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be refuted. He brought the case of removing a priest from altar service in order to have him testify on another’s behalf, since his testimony might acquit the accused and save him from execution. But <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>that <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Abaye, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abaye said: </span>If the accused says he has a witness in his favor, <span class="gemarra-regular">we send a pair of rabbis </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>behalf <span class="gemarra-regular">to determine if his words </span>of testimony have <span class="gemarra-regular">substance. </span>These rabbis would first check that the testimony of the priest is substantive before removing him from the altar. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>that one interrupts the Temple service to save a life from <span class="gemarra-regular">certain </span>danger, but <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where do we </span>derive that one interrupts the Temple service when the likelihood of saving life is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And for all </span>the other arguments as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">found </span>proofs for saving a life from <span class="gemarra-regular">certain </span>danger. But for cases of uncertainty, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where do we </span>derive this? For this reason, all the arguments are refuted. However, the proof <span class="gemarra-regular">that Shmuel</span> brought from the verse: “And live by them,” which teaches that one should not even put a life in possible danger to observe mitzvot, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is certainly no refutation. Ravina</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said, and some say it was Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</span> who said with regard to this superior proof of Shmuel: <span class="gemarra-regular">One spicy pepper is better than a whole basket of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> squash, </span>since its flavor is more powerful than all the others.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offering, </span>which atones for unwitting performance of transgressions punishable by <span class="it-text">karet</span>, and <span class="gemarra-regular">a definite guilt-offering, </span>which is brought for robbery and misuse of consecrated items, <span class="gemarra-regular">atone </span>for those sins. <span class="gemarra-regular">Death and Yom Kippur atone </span>for sins when accompanied <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">repentance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Repentance </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">atones for minor transgressions, for</span> both <span class="gemarra-regular">positive </span>mitzvot <span class="gemarra-regular">and negative </span>mitzvot. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>repentance places punishment <span class="gemarra-regular">for severe </span>transgressions <span class="gemarra-regular">in abeyance until Yom Kippur comes and</span> completely <span class="gemarra-regular">atones </span>for the transgression. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who says: I will sin and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">I will repent, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I will sin and I will repent, </span>Heaven <span class="gemarra-regular">does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> provide him the opportunity to repent, </span>and he will remain a sinner all his days. With regard to one who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will sin and Yom Kippur </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">atone </span>for my sins, <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur does not atone </span>for his sins. Furthermore, for <span class="gemarra-regular">transgressions between a person and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> God, Yom Kippur atones; </span>however, for <span class="gemarra-regular">transgressions between a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">person and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur does not atone until </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he appeases </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>person. 
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya taught </span>that point from the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“From all your sins you shall be cleansed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before the Lord” </span>(Leviticus 16:30). For <span class="gemarra-regular">transgressions between a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">person and God, Yom Kippur atones; </span>however, for <span class="gemarra-regular">transgressions between</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a person and another, Yom Kippur does not atone until</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he appeases </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>person. In conclusion, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: How fortunate are you, Israel; before Whom are you purified</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and Who purifies you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">your Father in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Heaven, as it is stated: “And I will sprinkle purifying</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> water upon you, and you shall be purified” </span>(Ezekiel 36:25). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it says: “The ritual bath of Israel is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">God” </span>(Jeremiah 17:13). <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as a ritual bath purifies the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> impure, so too, the Holy One, Blessed be He, purifies</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Israel.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna says that a definite guilt-offering atones for sins. The Gemara analyzes this: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a definite guilt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, yes, </span>it does atone for sins. This implies that <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">guilt-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering</span> does <span class="gemarra-regular">not. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t atonement written with regard to it? </span>Why, then, doesn’t it atone? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Those, </span>the sin-offerings and definite guilt-offerings, <span class="gemarra-regular">facilitate complete atonement, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertain guilt-offering does not facilitate complete atonement. </span>Instead, this offering provides temporary atonement for an individual, to protect him from punishment until he becomes aware of his sin and brings the appropriate offering. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>there is this distinction: <span class="gemarra-regular">Nothing else facilitates the atonement of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>sin-offerings and definite guilt-offerings, whereas something <span class="gemarra-regular">else </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does facilitate the atonement of the uncertain guilt-offering, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur passed, those </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who are obligated to bring sin-offerings and definite guilt-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offerings are </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated </span>to bring their offerings; however, those obligated to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain guilt-offerings are exempt </span>because Yom Kippur atoned for them.
§ It was taught in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Yom Kippur atone </span>for sins when accompanied <span class="gemarra-regular">by repentance. </span>The Gemara analyzes this: <span class="gemarra-regular">With repentance, yes, </span>they do atone for sins; <span class="gemarra-regular">but by themselves, </span>without repentance, <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Let us say </span>that the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all transgressions in the Torah, whether one repented or did</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not repent, Yom Kippur atones, </span>with the <span class="gemarra-regular">exception </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">rejecting</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the yoke </span>of Torah and mitzvot; and denying the Holy One, Blessed be He; <span class="gemarra-regular">and interpreting the Torah falsely; and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> violating the covenant of the flesh, </span>i.e., circumcision. In these cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">if one repents Yom Kippur atones </span>for his sin, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if one does not repent Yom Kippur </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not atone </span>for his sin. 
The Gemara rejects this: This is no proof; <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, the mishna can be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Repentance </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">requires Yom Kippur </span>in order to complete the atonement, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">require repentance </span>but atones even without it. 
§ It was taught in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Repentance </span>itself <span class="gemarra-regular">atones for minor transgressions, for </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">a positive </span>mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">and for a negative </span>mitzva. The Gemara is surprised at this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>that it was stated that repentance <span class="gemarra-regular">atones for a negative </span>mitzva, which is severe and warrants lashes, is it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to also teach that it atones <span class="gemarra-regular">for a positive </span>mitzva, which is more lenient? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: This is </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">it said, </span>i.e., the mishna should be understood as follows: Repentance atones <span class="gemarra-regular">for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a positive </span>mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">and for a negative </span>mitzva whose violation <span class="gemarra-regular">can be rectified by a positive </span>mitzva. One is not punished by a court for violating a prohibition for which the Torah prescribes a positive act as a corrective measure and which thereby has the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> as a positive mitzva. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>does repentance <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>atone <span class="gemarra-regular">for a full</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-fledged negative </span>mitzva? The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from a separate source: It was taught that <span class="gemarra-regular">these are minor </span>transgressions: <span class="gemarra-regular">A positive </span>mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">and a negative </span>mitzva, 

Daf 86a

<span class="gemarra-regular">except</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for: “You shall not take </span>the name of the Lord, your God, in vain” (Exodus 20:6), about which the Torah states: “For God will not absolve him who takes His name in vain” (Exodus 20:6). The Gemara answers: It is not that this is the only negative mitzva that is not a minor transgression; rather, it is: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not take </span>the name of the Lord, your God, in vain” <span class="gemarra-regular">and any </span>prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to it, </span>meaning all severe prohibitions that carry punishment by a court. 
The Gemara proposes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>from that which was taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda says: </span>For <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>sin <span class="gemarra-regular">from “You shall not take </span>the name of the Lord, your God, in vain” <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> below, </span>i.e., prohibitions less severe than that, <span class="gemarra-regular">repentance atones</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>For any sin <span class="gemarra-regular">from “You shall not take </span>the name of the Lord, your God, in vain” <span class="gemarra-regular">and above, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">repentance suspends </span>punishment <span class="gemarra-regular">and Yom Kippur atones. </span>The Gemara rejects this: This does not constitute proof either, since one could say that it is referring to: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall not take</span> the name of the Lord, your God, in vain” <span class="gemarra-regular">and anything similar to it.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>from a different source that was taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since it was stated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">at Horeb </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">repentance: “Absolve,” </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the transgression of: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>the name of the Lord, your God, in vain” is included <span class="gemarra-regular">among them; </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verses states: “Will not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> absolve” </span>(Exodus 20:6). One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought this is <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>true <span class="gemarra-regular">for those who are liable </span>for violating <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">other prohibitions; </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “His name.” </span>God <span class="gemarra-regular">does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not absolve the one </span>who disrespects <span class="gemarra-regular">His name, but He</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> absolves those who are liable </span>for violating <span class="gemarra-regular">all other prohibitions</span> and repent. This is proof that those who violate all other prohibitions are not comparable to one who violates: “You shall not take the name of the Lord, your God, in vain.” 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">For what does repentance atone? </span>It atones <span class="gemarra-regular">for a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> positive </span>mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">and for a negative </span>mitzva that can be rectified <span class="gemarra-regular">through a positive mitzva. And for what does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">repentance suspend </span>punishment <span class="gemarra-regular">and Yom Kippur atone? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>sins punishable by <span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and for </span>sins punishable by the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>penalty from the earthly <span class="gemarra-regular">court, and for full-fledged </span><span class="gemarra-regular">negative </span>mitzvot. This indicates that there is a <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who distinguishes between prohibitions that warrant lashes and those that do not. Therefore, there is a tannaitic dispute as to whether or not prohibitions that warrant punishment by the courts can be rectified by repentance alone.
§ Since the Gemara cited this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, it now clarifies part of it. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said: Since it was stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at Horeb </span>with regard to repentance: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Absolve.” </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do we </span>derive this concept that repentance was mentioned there? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar says: It is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">possible to say “absolve” </span>(Exodus 34:7) about all transgressions, since <span class="gemarra-regular">“will not absolve” is already stated </span>(Exodus 34:7). <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is not possible to say “will not absolve,” </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">“absolve” is already stated. How so? </span>The Holy One, Blessed be He, <span class="gemarra-regular">absolves those who repent and does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">absolve those who do not repent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Therefore, both “repentance” and “absolve” were mentioned at Horeb.
Furthermore, with regard to the topic of repentance, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Matya ben Ḥarash asked Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya </span>when Rabbi Elazar was <span class="gemarra-regular">in Rome: Have you heard </span>the teaching that there are <span class="gemarra-regular">four distinctions </span>in the process <span class="gemarra-regular">of atonement that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yishmael would derive? He said to him: They </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>not four but <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>distinctions, <span class="gemarra-regular">and repentance </span>is necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">with each one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
These are the categories: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one violates</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a positive </span>mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">and repents, he is forgiven even before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he moves </span>from his place, i.e. immediately, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated: “Return, you backsliding children, </span>I will heal your backsliding” (Jeremiah 3:22), implying that when one repents he is immediately forgiven.If <span class="gemarra-regular">one violates a prohibition </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and repents, repentance suspends </span>his punishment <span class="gemarra-regular">and Yom Kippur atones </span>for his sin, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “For on this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> day shall atonement be made for you, </span>to purify you <span class="gemarra-regular">from all your sins” </span>(Leviticus 16:30). If <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">commits </span>a transgression that warrants <span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>a sin punishable by <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>from the earthly <span class="gemarra-regular">court and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">repents, repentance </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Yom Kippur suspend </span>his punishment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and suffering absolves </span>and completes the atonement, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Then will I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> strokes” </span>(Psalms 89:33).
<span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who has </span>caused <span class="gemarra-regular">desecration of</span> God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">name</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his repentance has no power to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> suspend </span>punishment, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor does Yom Kippur </span>have power <span class="gemarra-regular">to atone</span> for his sin, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor does suffering </span>alone have power <span class="gemarra-regular">to absolve </span>him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, all these suspend </span>punishment, <span class="gemarra-regular">and death</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> absolves </span>him, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And the Lord </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Hosts revealed Himself to my ears: This iniquity shall </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not be atoned for until you die” </span>(Isaiah 22:14).
§ The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>that cause <span class="gemarra-regular">desecration of </span>God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">name</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav said: For example, </span>in the case of someone like <span class="gemarra-regular">me, </span>since I am an important public figure, <span class="gemarra-regular">if I take meat from a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> butche</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and do not give him money immediately, </span>people are likely to think that I did not mean to pay at all. They would consider me a thief and learn from my behavior that one is permitted to steal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: They taught this </span>statement of Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">only in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a place where they do not ask </span>for the money, where it is not customary for the butcher himself to come and collect payment from the customer. When the customer does not pay immediately, people may suspect him of theft. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in a place where they ask </span>for the money from the customer some time later, <span class="gemarra-regular">we have no </span>problem <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>doing this. Since everyone understands he is buying on credit, he is not desecrating God’s name. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>My native <span class="gemarra-regular">city </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Meḥasya is a place </span><span class="gemarra-regular">where they ask </span>for and collect the money. The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Abaye bought meat from two partners, he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would give </span>half of <span class="gemarra-regular">the money to this one and</span> half of <span class="gemarra-regular">the money to this one, </span>so that each would know that he had paid. <span class="gemarra-regular">And afterward he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would bring them together and perform the calculation </span>to see whether he was owed any change.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>What is an example of desecration of God’s name? <span class="gemarra-regular">For example, </span>someone like <span class="gemarra-regular">me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, if </span>I would <span class="gemarra-regular">walk four cubits without Torah and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">without phylacteries, </span>and the onlookers did not know that it is only on account of my body’s weakness, that would be a desecration of God’s name. <span class="gemarra-regular">Yitzḥak from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the school of Rabbi Yannai said: Any </span>case when <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s friends are embarrassed on account of his reputation, </span>meaning his friends are embarrassed due to things they hear about him, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is a desecration of </span>God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">name. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>One creates a profanation of God’s name, <span class="gemarra-regular">for example, when people say </span>about him: <span class="gemarra-regular">May his Master forgiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so-and-so </span>for the sins he has done.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: As it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that it is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall love the Lord your God”</span> (Deuteronomy 6:5), which means <span class="gemarra-regular">that you shall make the name</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Heaven beloved</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> How should one do so? One should do so <span class="gemarra-regular">in that he </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">read </span>Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> learn </span>Mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">and serve Torah scholars, and he should be</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pleasant with people in his business transactions. What do people</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say about </span>such a person? <span class="gemarra-regular">Fortunate is his father </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who taught him Torah, fortunate is his teacher who taught </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him Torah, woe to the people who have not studied </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah. So-and-so, who taught him Torah, see how </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pleasant are his ways, how proper are his deeds. The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">verse states about him </span>and others like him: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> My servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified” </span>(Isaiah 49:3).
<span class="gemarra-regular">But one who reads </span>Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">and learns </span>Mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">and serves </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah scholars, but his business practices are not </span>done <span class="gemarra-regular">faithfully, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and he does not speak pleasantly with other people, what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">do people say about him? Woe to so-and-so </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who studied Torah, woe to his father who taught him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah, woe to his teacher who taught him Torah. So-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">and-so who studied Torah, see how destructive are his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">deeds, and how ugly are his ways. About him </span>and others like him <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states </span>that the gentiles will say: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Men said of them: These are the people of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Lord, yet they had to leave His land” </span>(Ezekiel 36:20). Through their sins and subsequent exile, such people have desecrated the name of God.
§ Further on the topic of repentance, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: Great is repentance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it brings healing to the world, as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> stated: “I will heal their backsliding, I will love them</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> freely” </span>(Hosea 14:5), which teaches that repentance from sin brings healing. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina raised a contradiction </span>between two verses. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is written </span>in one verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Return, you backsliding </span><span class="gemarra-regular">children” </span>(Jeremiah 3:22), implying that <span class="gemarra-regular">initially </span>when you sinned, it was only because <span class="gemarra-regular">you were backsliding, </span>i.e., rebelling. It was merely an act of immaturity and foolishness and could be ignored as if it had never happened. <span class="gemarra-regular">But it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is written: “I will heal your backsliding” </span>(Jeremiah 3:22), implying that He will heal the sin from this point onward, and that they are still sinners. He resolved this contradiction, explaining that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: Here, </span>where everything is forgiven as if the Jewish people never sinned, it is referring to repentance <span class="gemarra-regular">out of love; there, </span>where the sin is still remembered despite the forgiveness and repentance, it is referring to repentance <span class="gemarra-regular">out of fear. </span>
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda raised a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contradiction </span>between two verses. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is written: “Return, you backsliding </span><span class="gemarra-regular">children I will heal your backsliding” </span>(Jeremiah 3:22), implying that anyone can achieve healing, which is dependent only on repentance. But it also states: “Return, O backsliding children, says the Lord, <span class="gemarra-regular">for I am a lord to you, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I will take you one from a city, and two </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from a family” </span>(Jeremiah 3:14), implying that repentance is available only to certain individuals. He resolved the contradiction and explained that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: Here, </span>it is referring to repentance <span class="gemarra-regular">out of love or fear, </span>which few people achieve; <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>it referring is repentance <span class="gemarra-regular">through suffering, </span>as everyone has thoughts of repentance when they suffer. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Levi said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Great is repentance, as it reaches the heavenly throne, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is stated: “Return, Israel, to the Lord your God</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Hosea 14:2). This implies that repentance literally reaches to God. 

Daf 86b

§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Great is repentance, as</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">overrides </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">a prohibition of the Torah. </span>How so? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated </span>that God said: <span class="gemarra-regular">“…Saying: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If a man sends away his wife and she goes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from him and becomes another man’s, may he return </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to her again? Will not that land be greatly polluted? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">But you have committed adultery with many lovers; and would </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you yet return to Me, said the Lord” </span>(Jeremiah 3:1). Indeed, the Torah states: “Her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife after she has been made impure” (Deuteronomy 24:4). The relationship between the Jewish people and the Holy One, Blessed be He, is compared to that between a husband and wife. Just as it is prohibited for an adulterous wife to return to her husband, it should be prohibited for the Jewish people to return to God from their sins, yet repentance overrides this prohibition. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan said: Great is repentance, which hastens the redemption,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: “And a redeemer will come to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Zion, and to those who repent from transgression in Jacob</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Isaiah 59:20). <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a redeemer </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will come to Zion? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>there are <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who repent from transgression in Jacob.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: Great </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is repentance, as </span>the penitent’s <span class="gemarra-regular">intentional sins are counted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for him as unwitting transgressions, as it is stated: “Return, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Israel, to the Lord your God, for you have stumbled </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in your iniquity” </span>(Hosea 14:2). The Gemara analyzes this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’t “iniquity” </span>mean <span class="gemarra-regular">an intentional sin? Yet </span>the prophet <span class="gemarra-regular">calls</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it stumbling, </span>implying that one who repents is considered as though he only stumbled accidentally in his transgression. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? Didn’t Reish Lakish </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Great is repentance, as one’s intentional sins are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> counted for him as merits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “And when the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Ezekiel 33:19), and all his deeds, even his transgressions, will become praiseworthy? The Gemara reconciles: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>when one repents <span class="gemarra-regular">out of love, </span>his sins become like merits; <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>when one repents <span class="gemarra-regular">out of fear, </span>his sins are counted as unwitting transgressions.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Great is repentance, which lengthens </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">years of a person</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s </span>life, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “When the wicked </span><span class="gemarra-regular">man turns from his wickedness </span>that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, <span class="gemarra-regular">he will preserve</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his life” </span>(Ezekiel 18:27). 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak said: They say in the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rabba bar Mari: Come </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and see that the attribute of flesh and blood is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unlike the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He.</span> With <span class="gemarra-regular">flesh and blood </span>people, if one <span class="gemarra-regular">insults his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">friend with words, it is uncertain whether </span>the victim will <span class="gemarra-regular">be appeased by him or </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">not be appeased by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him. And if you say he will be appeased, it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain whether he </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">be appeased by words </span>alone <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">not be appeased by words </span>alone, and one must try to appease him in other ways.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy </span><span class="gemarra-regular">One, Blessed be He, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">a person commits a transgression </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in private, </span>God <span class="gemarra-regular">is appeased by words, as it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stated: “Take with you words and return to God” </span>(Hosea 14:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">And not only that, but </span>God <span class="gemarra-regular">considers it </span>as though he has done <span class="gemarra-regular">a favor </span>for God by repenting, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Accept that which is good” </span>(Hosea 14:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">And not only that, but the verse ascribes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>credit <span class="gemarra-regular">as though he had sacrificed bulls, as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is stated: “So we will render for bulls the offering </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of our lips” </span>(Hosea 14:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>he is considered only like one who offers <span class="gemarra-regular">obligatory bulls, </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verse states: “I will heal their backsliding, I will love</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> them freely” </span>(Hosea 14:5). Repentance is considered as though it were the sacrifice of a free-will offering. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir would say: Great is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">repentance because the entire world is forgiven on account of </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">individual who repents, as it is stated: “I will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for My </span><span class="gemarra-regular">anger has turned away from him” </span>(Hosea 14:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">It </span><span class="gemarra-regular">does not say: From them, </span>i.e., from the sinners, <span class="gemarra-regular">but “from him,” </span>i.e., from that individual. Because he repented, everyone will be healed.
§ With regard to repentance, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>that demonstrate that one <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>completely <span class="gemarra-regular">repented</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yehuda said: For example, the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited matter came to his hand a first time and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a second time, and he was saved from it, </span>thereby proving that he has completely repented. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda demonstrated </span>what he meant: If one has the opportunity to sin <span class="gemarra-regular">with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the same woman </span>he sinned with previously, <span class="gemarra-regular">at the same</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> tim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">the same place, </span>and everything is aligned as it was that first time when he sinned, but this time he overcomes his inclination, it proves his repentance is complete, and he is forgiven. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav raised a contradiction: It is written: “Fortunate is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is hidden” </span>(Psalms 32:1), implying that it is inappropriate for one to reveal his sins, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written: “He who hides </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his transgressions shall not prosper” </span>(Proverbs 28:13). He resolved the contradiction as follows: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. Here </span>it is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a publicized sin; </span>since his sin is public knowledge it is fitting for him to also publicize his repentance. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a sin that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not publicized, </span>in which case it is inappropriate to publicize one’s repentance. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Zutra bar Toviya </span>said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: Here, </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to sins a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person commits against another; </span>he must publicize his repentance so that those who hear him may persuade the other to forgive him. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to sins a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">person commits against God, </span>in which case he need not repent publicly.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: </span>When <span class="gemarra-regular">a person commits a transgression </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first time, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is forgiven; a second </span>time, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is forgiven; a third</span> time, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is forgiven; </span>but the <span class="gemarra-regular">fourth </span>time, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not forgiven, as it is stated: “Thus said the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Lord: For three transgressions of Israel, but for four I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will not reverse it” </span>(Amos 2:6). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “All these things does God do twice or three times</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with a man” </span>(Job 33:29). 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is: And it says? </span>Why did he need to bring an additional biblical proof when the first verse seems to suffice? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>statement that the Holy One, Blessed be He, forgives easily the first three times <span class="gemarra-regular">applies to a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">community but not to an individual, come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>proof from another verse that states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“All these things does God</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> do twice or three times with a man,” </span>implying that this so even for an individual. <span class="gemarra-regular">From this </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">onward, he is not forgiven, as it is stated: “For </span><span class="gemarra-regular">three transgressions of Israel, but for four I will not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reverse it.</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">transgressions that one confessed on this Yom Kippur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, he should not confess them on another Yom Kippur, </span>since he has already been forgiven. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he repeated </span><span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>same transgressions during the year, <span class="gemarra-regular">he must confess </span>them again <span class="gemarra-regular">on another Yom Kippur. And if he did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> repeat them but did confess them again, about him the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> verse states: “As a dog that returns to its vomit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, so is a fool who repeats his folly” </span>(Proverbs 26:11), since it is inappropriate to go back and mention one’s earlier sins. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>If one confesses in subsequent years, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more </span><span class="gemarra-regular">so is he praiseworthy, </span>as he remembers his earlier sins and is thereby humbled, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “For I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> know my transgressions; and my sin is ever before me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Psalms 51:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">But how do I establish the </span>meaning of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Like a dog that returns to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">its vomit”? </span>It may be established <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">opinion of Rav Huna, as Rav Huna said: When a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person commits a transgression and repeats it, it is permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him. </span>The Gemara is surprised at this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Can </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it enter your mind that it is permitted to him </span>because he has sinned twice? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say it becomes to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him as if </span>it were <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted.</span>
Furthermore, during confession, <span class="gemarra-regular">one must detail the si</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> he committed and not suffice with a general admission of sin, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>“And Moses returned to the Lord and said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Please,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this people have sinned a great sin, and have made</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> themselves a god of gold” </span>(Exodus 32:31); this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava. Rabbi Akiva says </span>that the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Fortunate is he whose transgression is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forgiven, whose sin is hidden” </span>(Psalms 32:1), which teaches that one need not detail his sins. <span class="gemarra-regular">But what is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Moses said: “And have made </span><span class="gemarra-regular">themselves a god of gold” </span>(Exodus 32:31)? It should be understood <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yannai, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Yannai said: Moses said before the Holy One, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Blessed be He: Master of the universe, </span>it is the <span class="gemarra-regular">silver and gold that you gave to the Jewish people</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in abundance, until they said: Enough, </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">caused them to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> make a god of gold. </span>Consequently, the phrase: “And have made themselves a god of gold,” is not a description of the sin but an explanation and justification of it. 
It is said that <span class="gemarra-regular">two good leaders arose for the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Jewish people: Moses and David. Moses said: Let my disgrace</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be written, </span>i.e., may the sin I committed be written explicitly, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Because you did not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> believe in Me, to sanctify Me” </span>(Numbers 20:12). In contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">David said: Let my disgrace not be written, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is stated: “Fortunate is he whose transgression is forgiven</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, whose sin is hidden” </span>(Psalms 32:1). 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">A parable </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses and David </span>shows <span class="gemarra-regular">to what this may be compared. </span>It may be compared <span class="gemarra-regular">to two women who were flogged in court </span>for their sins. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">sinned </span>by engaging in forbidden relations, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one ate unripe figs of the Sabbatical Year </span>although they are forbidden. <span class="gemarra-regular">The woman who ate the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unripe figs of the Sabbatical Year said to </span>the court: <span class="gemarra-regular">Please publicize </span>the sin <span class="gemarra-regular">for which </span>I am being <span class="gemarra-regular">flogged,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> so that </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">will not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">what that </span>woman <span class="gemarra-regular">is being flogged for is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">what this </span>woman <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> being flogged for. They brought unripe figs of the Sabbatical</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Year, and hung them around her neck, and announced before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> her, saying: She is receiving lashes on account of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Sabbatical Year. </span>Moses requested that his sin be publicized so that people would not think that he committed the same sins as the members of his generation, i.e., the Golden Calf and the report of the spies.
Furthermore, they said: <span class="gemarra-regular">One exposes the hypocrite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">desecration of </span>God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">name, </span>so others will not think that they are truly righteous and that their deeds bear imitating, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “When a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will lay a stumbling block before him” </span>(Ezekiel 3:20). That is, when people do not know that someone is wicked to the core, he causes other people to err and this desecrates the name of God when it is revealed. <span class="gemarra-regular">The repentance of utterly </span>wicked <span class="gemarra-regular">people prevents suffering </span>from coming upon them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And although the sentence of judgment has </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">been signed </span>against them <span class="gemarra-regular">for suffering, </span>their repentance prevents them from being punished.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tranquility of the wicked is ultimately their destruction, </span>as in their contentment they sit and think about forbidden matters. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-regular">authority buries one who owns it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He was naked </span><span class="gemarra-regular">when he entered </span>into power, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he will be naked</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when he leaves it, and if only his exit would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be like his entrance, </span>without sin and added iniquity. The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav would leave </span>his home <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>go to court to <span class="gemarra-regular">judge cases, he </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say this </span>of himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">Of his own will, he goes to die,</span> because a judge who misjudges a case is liable to death at the hand of Heaven; <span class="gemarra-regular">and he does not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fulfill the will of his household and he goes empty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">-handed to his household, </span>because a judge does not receive a salary; <span class="gemarra-regular">and if only his entrance would be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">like his exit, </span>without sin or transgression.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When Rava </span><span class="gemarra-regular">would go to judge, he would say this </span>of himself: 

Daf 87a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Of his own will, he goes to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> die; and he does not fulfill the will of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his household, and he goes empty-handed to his household</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; and if only his entrance would be like his exit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And when he saw a line of people [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ambuha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> following <span class="gemarra-regular">after him </span>out of respect for him, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: “Though his excellency ascends to the heavens, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his head reaches to the clouds, yet he shall perish </span><span class="gemarra-regular">forever like his own dung; they who have seen him </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will say: Where is he?” </span>(Job 20:6–7). This teaches that when one achieves power, it can lead to his downfall. <span class="gemarra-regular">When they would carry Rav Zutra on their shoulders during</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Shabbat of the Festival </span>when he taught, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> recite </span>the following to avoid becoming arrogant: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For power </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is not forever, and does the crown endure for all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">generations?” </span>(Proverbs 27:24).
§ It was further taught: <span class="gemarra-regular">“It is not good to respect </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the person of the wicked” </span>(Proverbs 18:5), meaning, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not good for wicked people when they are respected in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this world </span>and are not punished their sins. For example, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">not good for Ahab to be respected in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this world, as it is stated: “Because he humbled himself</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before Me, I will not bring the evil in his</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> days” </span>(I Kings 21:29), and Ahab thereby lost his share in the World-to-Come.
The opposite is also true. The complete verse states: “It is not good to respect the person of the wicked, <span class="gemarra-regular">to turn aside the righteous</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in judgment” </span>(Proverbs 18:5), meaning: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is good for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the righteous when they are not respected in this world</span> and are punished in this world for their sins. For example, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">good for Moses that he was not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> respected in this world, as it is stated: “Because you</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not believe in Me, to sanctify Me” </span>(Numbers 20:12). The Gemara analyzes this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Had you believed in Me, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your time still would not have come to depart the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">world.</span>
They said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Fortunate are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the righteous </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">not only do they </span>accumulate <span class="gemarra-regular">merit </span>for themselves, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they </span>accumulate <span class="gemarra-regular">merit for their children and their</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> children’s children until the end of all generations; as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there were several sons of Aaron who </span>essentially <span class="gemarra-regular">deserved to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> be burned like Nadav and Avihu, as it is stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span>“The sons of Aaron <span class="gemarra-regular">who were left” </span>(Leviticus 10:16), implying that others were left as well although they deserved to be burned with their brothers. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the merit of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> their father protected them, </span>and they and their descendants were priests for all time.
On the other hand: <span class="gemarra-regular">Woe to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the wicked, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">not only do they render themselves liable, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but they also render their children and children’s children </span><span class="gemarra-regular">liable until the end of all generations. </span>For example, <span class="gemarra-regular">Canaan </span><span class="gemarra-regular">had many children </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">deserved to be ordained </span>as rabbis and instructors of the public due to their great stature in Torah study, <span class="gemarra-regular">like Tavi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the servant of Rabban </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Gamliel, </span>who was famous for his wisdom; <span class="gemarra-regular">but their father</span><span class="gemarra-regular">’s liability caused them </span>to remain as slaves.
Furthermore: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whoever </span>accumulates <span class="gemarra-regular">merit for the public will not have sin </span><span class="gemarra-regular">come to his hand, </span>and God protects him from failing; <span class="gemarra-regular">but whoever causes the public to sin has almost no </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ability to repent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">whoever </span>accumulates <span class="gemarra-regular">merit for the public will not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have sin come to his hand? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he will not be in Gehenna while his students are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in the Garden of Eden, as it is stated: “For </span><span class="gemarra-regular">You will not abandon my soul to the nether-world; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">neither will You suffer Your godly one to see the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pit” </span>(Psalms 16:10). On the other hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">whoever causes the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> public to sin has almost no ability to repent, </span>so that <span class="gemarra-regular">he will not be in the Garden of Eden</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> while his students are in Gehenna, as it is stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “A man who is laden with the blood of any</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> person shall hasten his steps to the pit; none will</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> support him” </span>(Proverbs 28:17). Since he oppressed others and caused them to sin, he shall have no escape. 
§ The Gemara returns to interpreting the mishna. It states there that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: I will sin </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and I will repent, I will sin and I will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">repent, </span>is not given the opportunity to repent.The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span><span class="gemarra-regular">twice: I will sin and I will repent, I will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sin and repent? </span>The Gemara explains that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rav Huna </span>said that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: Once a person </span><span class="gemarra-regular">commits a transgression and repeats it, it becomes permitted to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him. </span>The Gemara is surprised at this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Can it enter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> your mind that it becomes permitted to him? Rather, </span>say that <span class="gemarra-regular">it becomes to him as </span>though it were <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. </span>Consequently, the sinner who repeats his sin has difficulty abandoning his sin, and the repetition of his sin is reflected in the repetition of the phrase.
It is stated in the mishna that if one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will sin and Yom </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Kippur</span> will <span class="gemarra-regular">atone </span>for my sins, <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur does not atone </span>for his sins. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that the mishna is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Yom Kippur atones for all transgressions of the Torah, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">whether one repented or did not repent. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is different </span>when it is <span class="gemarra-regular">on the basis </span>of being permitted to sin. Even Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi agrees that Yom Kippur does not atone for the transgressions one commits only because he knows that Yom Kippur will atone for them.
§ It was taught in the mishna: Yom Kippur atones for <span class="gemarra-regular">sins committed</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> against God </span>but does not atone for sins committed against another person. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef bar Ḥavu raised a contradiction before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Abbahu: </span>The mishna states that <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur does </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not atone for sins committed against a fellow person, but </span><span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it written: “If one man sin against another, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">God [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Elohim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] shall judge him [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ufilelo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(I Samuel 2:25). The word <span class="it-text">ufilelo</span>, which may also refer to prayer, implies that if he prays, God will grant the sinner forgiveness. He answered him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Elohim</span> mentioned in the verse? It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a judge [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">elohim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>and not to God, and the word <span class="it-text">ufilelo</span> in the verse indicates judgment. Atonement occurs only after justice has been done toward the injured party by means of a court ruling. 
Rav Yosef bar Ḥavu said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, say </span>the following with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But if a man</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sin against the Lord, who shall entreat [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yitpallel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him?” </span>(I Samuel 2:25). This is difficult, since it has been established that the root <span class="it-text">pll</span> is interpreted in this verse as indicating judgment, and therefore the latter clause of the verse implies that if one sins toward God there is no one to judge him. Rabbi Abbahu answered him: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>what the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: If one man</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sins against another, God [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Elohim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] shall forgive him [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ufilelo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]; </span>if the sinner appeases the person against whom he has sinned, he will be forgiven. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if a man </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sin against the Lord, who shall entreat [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yitpallel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Repentance and good deeds. </span>The root <span class="it-text">pll</span> is to be interpreted as indicating forgiveness rather than judgment. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak said: One who angers his friend, even</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">verbally</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must appease him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “My son, if you have become a guarantor for your</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> neighbor, if you have struck your hands for a stranger</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, you are snared by the words of your mouth…Do</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this now, my son, and deliver yourself, seeing you have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> come into the hand of your neighbor. Go, humble yourself</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hitrapes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] and urge [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">rehav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] your neighbor” </span>(Proverbs 6:1–3). This should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you have money </span>that you owe him, <span class="gemarra-regular">open the palm of [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hater</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">pisat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>your <span class="gemarra-regular">hand to </span>your neighbor and pay the money that you owe; <span class="gemarra-regular">and if not, </span>if you have sinned against him verbally, <span class="gemarra-regular">increase [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">harbe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] friends for him, </span>i.e., send many people as your messengers to ask him for forgiveness.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: And one must appease the </span>one he has insulted <span class="gemarra-regular">with three rows of three people, as it is stated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: “He comes [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yashor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] before men, and says: I have sinned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not” </span>(Job 33:27). Rav Ḥisda interprets the word <span class="it-text">yashor</span> as related to the word <span class="it-text">shura</span>, row. The verse mentions sin three times: I have sinned, and perverted, and it profited me not. This implies that one should make three rows before the person from whom he is asking forgiveness. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: Anyone who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> asks forgiveness of his friend should not ask more than</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> three times</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: “Please, please </span><span class="gemarra-regular">forgive </span>the transgression of your brothers and their sin, for they did evil to you. <span class="gemarra-regular">And now, please </span>forgive” (Genesis 50:17). The verse uses the word please three times, which shows that one need not ask more than three times, after which the insulted friend must be appeased and forgive. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the insulted friend <span class="gemarra-regular">dies </span>before he can be appeased, <span class="gemarra-regular">one brings ten people, and stands them at the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> grave </span>of the insulted friend, <span class="gemarra-regular">and says </span>in front of them: <span class="gemarra-regular">I have sinned against the Lord, the God </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of Israel, and against so-and-so whom I wounded</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya </span>insulted <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba, </span>causing the latter to <span class="gemarra-regular">have a complaint against him. </span>Rabbi Yirmeya <span class="gemarra-regular">went and sat at the threshold </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba’s</span> house to beg him for forgiveness. <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Rabbi Abba’s <span class="gemarra-regular">maid poured out the </span>dirty <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span>from the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">the stream of water landed on </span>Rabbi Yirmeya’s <span class="gemarra-regular">head. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He said </span>about himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">They have made me into a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">trash heap, </span>as they are pouring dirty water on me. <span class="gemarra-regular">He recited </span>this verse <span class="gemarra-regular">about himself: “Who lifts up</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the needy out of the trash heap” </span>(Psalms 113:7). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba hear</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> what happened <span class="gemarra-regular">and went out to greet</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him. </span>Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Now I must go</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> out to appease you </span>for this insult, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> written: “Go, humble yourself [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hitrapes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] and urge your neighbor” </span>(Proverbs 6:3).
It is related that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rabbi Zeira had a complaint against a person</span> who insulted him, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would </span>pace <span class="gemarra-regular">back and forth </span><span class="gemarra-regular">before him and present himself, so that </span>the person <span class="gemarra-regular">could </span><span class="gemarra-regular">come and appease him. </span>Rabbi Zeira made himself available so that it would be easy for the other person to apologize to him.
It is further related that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">had a complaint against a certain butcher </span>who insulted him.<span class="gemarra-regular">The butcher did not come before him </span>to apologize. <span class="gemarra-regular">On Yom Kippur eve, </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I will go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">appease him. He met </span>his student <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to him: Where is my Master going? He said to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him: </span>I am going <span class="gemarra-regular">to appease so-and-so. </span>Rav Huna called Rav by his name and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Abba is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> going to kill a person, </span>for surely that person’s end will not be good. Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">went and stood </span><span class="gemarra-regular">by him. </span>He found the butcher <span class="gemarra-regular">sitting and splitting the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">head </span>of an animal. The butcher <span class="gemarra-regular">raised his eyes and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">saw him. He said </span>to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are you Abba? Go, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I have nothing </span>to say <span class="gemarra-regular">to you. While he was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">splitting the head, one of the bones </span>of the head <span class="gemarra-regular">flew out and struck him in the throat and killed </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him, </span>thereby fulfilling Rav Huna’s prediction.
The Gemara further relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav was reciting the </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">portion before</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. 

Daf 87b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya, </span>Rav’s uncle and teacher, <span class="gemarra-regular">came in, </span>whereupon Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">returned to the beginning </span>of the portion and began to read it again. Afterward, <span class="gemarra-regular">bar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Kappara came in, </span>and Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">returned to the beginning </span>of the portion out of respect for bar Kappara. Then <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shimon, son of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">came in, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he returned </span>again <span class="gemarra-regular">to the beginning </span>of the portion. Then, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina bar Ḥama came in, </span>and Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall I go back </span>and read <span class="gemarra-regular">so many times</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? He did not return </span>but continued from where he was. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina was offended </span>because Rav showed that he was less important than the others. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav went before </span>Rabbi Ḥanina <span class="gemarra-regular">on Yom Kippur eve </span>every year for <span class="gemarra-regular">thirteen </span>years to appease him, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he would not be appeased.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How could </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">act this way? Didn’t Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosei bar Ḥanina say: Anyone who requests forgiveness from another </span><span class="gemarra-regular">should not ask more than three times? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav is different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since he was very pious and forced himself to act beyond the letter of the law. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how could Rabbi Ḥanina act this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> way </span>and refuse to forgive Rav, though he asked many times? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Rava say: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who suppresses his honor </span>and forgives someone for hurting him, God <span class="gemarra-regular">pardons all his sins? </span>
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this is what happened: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina saw in a dream </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was being hung on a palm tree, and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>as a tradition that <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone </span>about whom there is a dream in <span class="gemarra-regular">which he was being hung on a palm </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tree will become the head </span>of a yeshiva. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Learn from this that he wants to become the head</span> of the yeshiva. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not be appeased, so</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that he will have to go and study Torah in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Babylonia. </span>He was conscious of the principle that one kingdom cannot overlap with another, and he knew that once Rav was appointed leader, he, Rabbi Ḥanina, would have to abdicate his own position or die. Therefore, he delayed being appeased, so that Rav would go to Babylonia and be appointed there as head of the yeshiva. In this way, the dream would be fulfilled, as Rav would indeed be appointed as head of a yeshiva, but since he would be in Babylonia, Rabbi Ḥanina would not lose his own position.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: </span>The main <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of confession </span>is on <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur eve when darkness </span>falls. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Sages said: </span>One should also <span class="gemarra-regular">confess </span>on Yom Kippur eve <span class="gemarra-regular">before he eats and drinks </span>at his last meal before the fast <span class="gemarra-regular">lest he become confuse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">at the meal, </span>due to the abundance of food and drink, and be unable to confess afterward. <span class="gemarra-regular">And although </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one confessed before he ate and drank, he confesses </span>again <span class="gemarra-regular">after he eats and drinks, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he committed some </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sin during the meal </span>itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">And although one confessed </span>during <span class="gemarra-regular">the evening prayer </span>on the night of Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span> should <span class="gemarra-regular">confess </span>again during <span class="gemarra-regular">the morning prayer. </span>Likewise, although one confessed during the <span class="gemarra-regular">morning prayer, he </span>should still <span class="gemarra-regular">confess during</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">additional prayer. </span>Similarly, although one confessed <span class="gemarra-regular">during </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">additional prayer, he </span>should also <span class="gemarra-regular">confess during </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">afternoon prayer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>and although one confessed <span class="gemarra-regular">during </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">afternoon prayer, he </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">confess </span>again <span class="gemarra-regular">during </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">closing prayer [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ne’ila</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> where </span>in the Yom Kippur prayers <span class="gemarra-regular">does one say </span>the confession? <span class="gemarra-regular">An individual </span>says it <span class="gemarra-regular">after his </span><span class="it-text">Amida</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">prayer, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the prayer leader says it in the middle </span>of the <span class="it-text">Amida</span> prayer. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What does one say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>what is the liturgy of the confession? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>One says the prayer that begins: <span class="gemarra-regular">You know the mysteries </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the universe, </span>in accordance with the standard liturgy. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shmuel said </span>that the prayer begins with: <span class="gemarra-regular">From the depths</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the heart. And Levi said </span>that it begins: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in your Torah it is written, saying, </span>and one then recites the forgiveness achieved by Yom Kippur as stated in the Torah. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said </span>that it begins: <span class="gemarra-regular">Master </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of the Universe.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said </span>that one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">For our iniquities are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> too many to count and our sins are too great</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to number. Rav Hamnuna said: </span>This is the liturgy of the confession: <span class="gemarra-regular">My God, before I was formed I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was unworthy. Now that I have been formed, it is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as if I had not been formed. I am dust</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> while alive, how much more so when I am dead</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. See, I am before You like a vessel filled with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shame and disgrace. May it be Your will that I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may sin no more, and as for </span>the sins <span class="gemarra-regular">I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> have committed before You, erase </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">in Your compassion, but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> not by suffering. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> confession that Rava </span>used <span class="gemarra-regular">all year </span>long; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it was the confession <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rav Hamnuna Zuta </span>used <span class="gemarra-regular">on Yom Kippur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">We said only </span>that one must follow all these versions <span class="gemarra-regular">when he did not say </span>the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">But we have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sinned. However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span>the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">But we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have sinned, he need not </span>say <span class="gemarra-regular">anything further </span>because that is the essential part of the confession. <span class="gemarra-regular">As bar Hamdudei </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: I was standing before Shmuel and he was sitting; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and when the prayer leader reached </span>the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">But we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have sinned, </span>Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">stood. </span>Bar Hamdudei <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Learn from here</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that this is the main </span>part of <span class="gemarra-regular">the confession, </span>and Shmuel stood up to emphasize the significance of these words.

And these are </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">three times</span> in the year: <span class="gemarra-regular">During </span>communal <span class="gemarra-regular">fasts </span>for lack of rain, on which the <span class="it-text">ne’ila</span> prayer is recited; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">during </span>non-priestly <span class="gemarra-regular">watches [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ma’amadot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>when the Israelite members of the guard parallel to the priestly watch come and read the account of Creation (see <span class="it-text">Ta’anit</span> 26a); <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on Yom Kippur. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the closing of the gates, </span>i.e., the <span class="it-text">ne</span>’<span class="it-text">ila</span> prayer? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">an added</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prayer </span>of <span class="it-text">Amida</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: </span>It is not a full prayer but only a confession that begins with the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are we, what are our lives? </span>The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to this from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, as it was taught: On <span class="gemarra-regular">the night of Yom Kippur, one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prays seven </span>blessings in the <span class="it-text">Amida</span> prayer <span class="gemarra-regular">and confesses; during</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">morning prayer, one prays seven </span>blessings <span class="gemarra-regular">and confesses; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">during </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">additional prayer, one prays seven </span>blessings <span class="gemarra-regular">and confesses; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">during </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">afternoon prayer, one prays seven </span>blessings <span class="gemarra-regular">and confesses; </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">during </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">ne’ila</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prayer, one prays seven </span>blessings <span class="gemarra-regular">and confesses. </span>This concurs with Rav’s opinion that <span class="it-text">ne’</span><span class="it-text">ila</span> is an added prayer. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span> They all agree that <span class="it-text">ne’ila</span> is an added prayer but disagree about the obligation to confess at the <span class="it-text">ne</span><span class="it-text">’ila</span> prayer, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: At the end of <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur, as darkness </span>falls, <span class="gemarra-regular">one prays</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seven </span>blessings of the <span class="it-text">Amida</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and confesses and ends with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the confession; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Rabbis say: He prays seven </span>blessings of the <span class="it-text">Amida</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if he wishes to end </span>his prayer <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a confession, he ends </span>it in this way. The Gemara says: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is a refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, </span>since all agree that <span class="it-text">ne’ila</span> is a complete prayer. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span>conclusive <span class="gemarra-regular">refutation. </span>
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla bar Rav went down </span>to lead the <span class="it-text">ne’ila</span> prayer <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rava, </span>who was in the synagogue. <span class="gemarra-regular">He opened </span>the prayer <span class="gemarra-regular">with: You have</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> chosen us, and he concluded with: What are we, what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are our lives? And </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">praised him. Rav Huna, son</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav Natan, said: And an individual says it after</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his </span><span class="it-text">Amida</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">prayer. </span>The individual says the confession after his <span class="it-text">Amida</span> prayer, not within the <span class="it-text">Amida</span> prayer as the prayer leader does.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ne’ila</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prayer exempts </span>one from <span class="gemarra-regular">the evening prayer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since one recited an added prayer after the afternoon prayer, when darkness fell, it serves as the evening prayer. The Gemara comments that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning </span>above, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he said: It is an added prayer, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and since he has prayed it he needs no further </span>prayer in the evening.
The Gemara is surprised at this: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did Rav </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say this? Didn’t Rav say: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with the statement of the one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who says </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">evening prayer is optional? </span>If it is optional, why would Rav use the term exempt?One is exempt even if he does not pray the closing prayer. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He said this in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance with the statement of the one who says </span>that the evening prayer <span class="gemarra-regular">is mandatory. </span>Even according to the opinion that maintains that the evening prayer is mandatory, if one recites <span class="it-text">ne’ila</span>, he has fulfilled his obligation to recite the evening prayer. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an objection </span>from that which we learned in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: During the <span class="gemarra-regular">evening </span>after <span class="gemarra-regular">Yom Kippur, one prays seven </span>blessings in the <span class="it-text">Amida</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and confesses; </span>during the <span class="gemarra-regular">morning prayer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>one prays <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>blessings in the <span class="it-text">Amida</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and confesses; </span>during the <span class="gemarra-regular">additional prayer, </span>one prays <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>blessings in the <span class="it-text">Amida</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and confesses; during </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ne’ila</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one prays seven </span>blessings in the <span class="it-text">Amida</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and confesses; </span>and during <span class="gemarra-regular">the evening </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prayer, </span>one prays <span class="gemarra-regular">seven </span>blessings <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>an <span class="gemarra-regular">abridged </span>version of the <span class="gemarra-regular">eighteen </span>blessings of the weekday <span class="it-text">Amida</span> prayer. One recites the first three blessings, the final three, and a middle blessing that includes an abbreviated form of the other weekday blessings. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel </span>says <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his ancestors: One prays </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">full eighteen </span>blessings of the weekday <span class="it-text">Amida</span> prayer as usual, 

Daf 88a

<span class="gemarra-regular">because he must recite </span><span class="gemarra-italic">havdala</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>the blessing: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who graciously grants knowledge, </span>and there is nowhere to insert this prayer in the abridged <span class="it-text">Amida</span>. This indicates that these <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> maintained that <span class="it-text">ne’ila</span> does not exempt one from the evening prayer. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is</span> a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Anyone who requires immersion immerses in his </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner on Yom Kippur, </span>as this act does not violate the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">washing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> A menstruating woman and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a new mother, </span>who immerse at night, <span class="gemarra-regular">immerse in their </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner on the night of Yom Kippur. </span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who had a seminal emission </span>during Yom Kippur before the afternoon prayer may <span class="gemarra-regular">immerse at any point </span>in the day <span class="gemarra-regular">until the afternoon prayer, </span>in order to be able to recite it. Ezra decreed that a man who has had a seminal emission must immerse in order to pray and study Torah. If the emission occurred after the afternoon prayer, he should not immerse then but should wait until darkness falls. Since the time for <span class="it-text">ne’ila</span> is at night, this individual should wait and immerse after the fast has concluded, so as to avoid violation of the prohibition of washing on Yom Kippur, and then pray afterward. This indicates that <span class="it-text">ne’ila</span> is a nighttime prayer, and therefore its recitation exempts one from the weekday evening prayer. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span>He may immerse <span class="gemarra-regular">at any point in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the day. </span>According to his opinion, the <span class="it-text">ne’ila</span> prayer is recited while it is still daytime, and therefore the individual must immerse in the daytime in order to be able to recite it. Consequently, Rabbi Yosei holds that <span class="it-text">ne</span><span class="it-text">’ila</span> does not exempt one from the evening prayer.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>with regard to this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> from that which was taught: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zava</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, the male and female leper, and one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who had relations with a menstruating woman, and one who</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is ritually impure </span>through contact with <span class="gemarra-regular">a corpse, </span>if their time has come for purification, they <span class="gemarra-regular">immerse in their </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner on Yom Kippur. A menstruating woman and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woman after childbirth immerse in their </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner on the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">night of Yom Kippur. One who had a seminal emission </span><span class="gemarra-regular">immerses at any point in the day. Rabbi Yosei says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the time of <span class="gemarra-regular">the afternoon prayer onward he is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">not able to immerse. </span>This contradicts Rabbi Yosei’s statement in the previous <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. 
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This</span> statement, in which Rabbi Yosei says that one may not immerse during the day, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>had already <span class="gemarra-regular">prayed the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ne’ila</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> prayer </span>before he noticed his seminal emission. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>statement, in which Rabbi Yosei says that one may immerse during the day, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he had not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">prayed </span>the <span class="it-text">ne’ila</span> prayer when he noticed his seminal emission, and he therefore immerses in order to pray <span class="it-text">ne’ila</span>.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he had already prayed </span><span class="it-text">ne’ila</span> before he noticed his seminal emission, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reasoning</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Rabbis, </span>who permit him to immerse on Yom Kippur? The immersion seems to have no purpose. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Rabbis hold that immersion at its proper </span><span class="gemarra-regular">time </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> even when one does not need to immerse to pray. Therefore, if the time for immersion falls on Yom Kippur, the individual should immerse as usual.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">By inference, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei holds </span>that immersion at its proper time is <span class="gemarra-regular">not a mitzva. But wasn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">name is written </span>in ink on one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">flesh,he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not wash and he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not smear </span>it with oil lest he erase the name, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">not stand in a filthy place </span>out of respect for the name. <span class="gemarra-regular">If his time came </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for an immersion </span>that is <span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzva, </span>he must try to ensure that the name not be erased. He therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">wraps a reed around it and descends and immerses. Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Yosei says: He descends and immerses in his </span>usual <span class="gemarra-regular">manner</span> and need not worry about erasing the name, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not rub </span>the place where the name is written.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we maintain</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree as to </span>whether or not <span class="gemarra-regular">immersion at</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its </span>proper <span class="gemarra-regular">time is a mitzva. </span>According to the Rabbis, immersion at its proper time is not a mitzva. Therefore, if the individual has no reed, he should wait even until the following day rather than immerse without it. However, Rabbi Yosei maintains that immersion at its proper time is a mitzva. Therefore, it must be done at its proper time, even if that requires immersion without covering God’s name. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>Rabbi Yosei mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yosei bar Yehuda, </span>and this resolves the contradiction, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says: It is sufficient for the immersion to be at </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the end. </span>According to one opinion, if a menstruating woman is uncertain on which day to immerse, she immerses multiple times to ensure that the required immersion is at its proper time. However, according to Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda, it is sufficient for her to immerse once at a point when she is certainly pure. Consequently, according to his opinion, there is no mitzva to immerse at the proper time. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: One who sees </span>an emission of <span class="gemarra-regular">semen on Yom Kippur descends and immerses. And in</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the evening, he should rub </span>his skin to remove anything that might obstruct the immersion. The Gemara is surprised at this: Why should he do that <span class="gemarra-regular">in the evening</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? What was, was. </span>Since he has already immersed, how will removing interpositions afterward benefit the immersion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should rub </span>his skin <span class="gemarra-regular">from the evening </span>before Yom Kippur to remove any obstructions, in case it becomes necessary to immerse on Yom Kippur. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>Master <span class="gemarra-regular">holds</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a mitzva to rub.</span>
§ Apropos the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of immersion for one who has had a seminal emission on Yom Kippur, the Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Naḥman: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who sees </span>an emission of <span class="gemarra-regular">semen on Yom Kippur, his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sins are forgiven. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But wasn’t it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">His sins are arranged </span>before him? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">arranged? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">They are arranged </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">forgiven. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: One </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who sees </span>an emission of <span class="gemarra-regular">semen on Yom Kippur should </span><span class="gemarra-regular">worry the whole yea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> that perhaps he was given a sign that he and his fast were rejected. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">if he survives the year, he can be assured </span>that his good deeds protected him and ensured for him <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">share </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the World-to-Come. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: Know </span>that it is so, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the whole world </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is hungry </span>due to refraining from conjugal relations, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is satiate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> since he emitted semen and his lust was subdued. Since the issue was involuntary and not intentional, it is a sign that he has merited divine compassion. <span class="gemarra-regular">When</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Dimi came from Eretz Yisrael </span>to Babylonia he said: Seeing semen on Yom Kippur is a sign that <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will live a long life, grow, and raise others</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> An allusion to that is the verse: “That he might see his seed and prolong his days” (Isaiah 53:10).
