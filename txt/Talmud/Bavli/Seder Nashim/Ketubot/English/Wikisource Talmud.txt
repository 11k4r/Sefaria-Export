Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

[Mishnah]  A MAIDEN IS MARRIED ON THE FOURTH DAY [OF THE WEEK] AND A WIDOW ON THE FIFTH DAY, 
FOR TWICE IN THE WEEK THE COURTS OF JUSTICE SIT IN THE TOWNS, 
ON THE SECOND DAY [OF THE WEEK] AND ON THE FIFTH DAY, SO THAT IF HE [THE HUSBAND] HAD A CLAIM AS TO THE VIRGINITY [OF THE MAIDEN-BRIDE] HE COULD GO EARLY [ON THE MORNING OF THE FIFTH DAY OF THE WEEK] TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE. 
[Gemarah]  R. Joseph said: Rab Judah said [that] Samuel said: 
Why did they [the Rabbis] Say. A MAIDEN IS MARRIED ON THE FOURTH DAY? 
Because we have learned:  ‘If the time [appointed for the marriage] arrived and they were not married, they eat of his [food] and they eat of terumah’ 
— you might think that if the time arrived on the first day in the week he would have to supply her with food, therefore have we learned, 
A MAIDEN IS MARRIED ON THE FOURTH DAY. 
Said R. Joseph: 
Lord of Abraham! 
He [Samuel] attaches a Mishnah which was taught, to a Mishnah which was not taught! 
Which was taught and which was not taught? 
This was taught and this was taught! 
— But [put it this way]: 
he attaches a Mishnah, the reason of which was explained, to a Mishnah, the reason of which was not explained. 
But if it was said, it was said thus; Rab Judah said [that] Samuel said: 
Why did they say, A MAIDEN IS MARRIED ON THE FOURTH DAY? Because IF HE HAD A Claim AS TO THE VIRGINITY HE COULD GO EARLY [NEXT MORNING] TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE 
— well, let her be married on the first day in the week, so that if he had a claim as to virginity he could go early [on the morning of the second day of the week] to the court of justice! [The answer is:] The Sages watched over the interests of the daughters of Israel so that [the bridegroom] should prepare for the [wedding.] feast three days, 
[namely] on the first day in the week, the second day in the week, and the third day in the week, and on the fourth day he marries her. 
And now that we have learned ‘shakedu’, that [Mishnah] which we have learned: If the time arrived and they were not married, they eat of his [food] and they eat of terumah, [is to be understood as implying that if] the time arrived on the first day in the week, since he cannot marry [her, on the first day of the week, on account of the ordinance], he does not give her food [on the three days, from the first day of the week to the fourth day]. 
Therefore [R. Joseph concludes], if he became ill or she became ill, or she became menstruous, he does not give her food. 
Some [scholars] there are who put this as a question: 
If he became ill, what is [the law]? 
[Shall I say:] There. the reason [he need not support her,] is because he is forced, and here, he is also forced? 
Or shall I say perhaps, 
there he is forced by an ordinance which the Rabbis ordained, [but] here, [he is] not? 
And if you will say: If he became ill he supplies her with food, [then the question would still be:] if she became ill, what is [the law]? 
Can he say unto her, 
‘I am here ready to marry you’? Or, perhaps, she can say unto him, ‘His field has been flooded’? 
And if you will say [that] she can say to him [when she falls ill], ‘His field has been flooded.’ [then the question is,] if she became menstruous, what is [the law]? 
During her regular time there is no question
