Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

A virgin is married on the fourth day [of the week] and a widow on the fifth day, for
twice in the week the courts sit in the towns,
on the second day [of the week] and on the fifth day, so that if he [the husband] had a claim as to the virginity [of the bride] he could go early [on the morning of the fifth day of the week] to the court.
GEMARA. R. Joseph said: Rav Judah said [that] Shmuel said: 
Why did they [the rabbis] say: A virgin is married on the fourth day?
Because we have learned: If the time [determined for the marriage] arrived and they were not married, they eat of his [food] and they eat of terumah.”
You might have thought that if the time arrived on the first day of the week he would have to supply her with food, therefore have we learned, 
“A virgin is married on the fourth day.”
R. Joseph said:
Master of Abraham!
He [Shmuel] attaches a Mishnah which was taught, to a Mishnah which was not taught!
Which was taught and which was not taught?
This was taught and this was taught!
Rather 
he attaches a Mishnah, the reason of which was explained, to a Mishnah, the reason of which was not explained.
Rather if it was said, this is what was said: Rav Judah said [that] Shmuel said:
Why did they say, “A virgin is married on the fourth day of the week”? Because if he had a virginity claim he could go early the [next morning] to the court. 
Let her be married on the first day of the week, and if he has a virginity claim he could go early [on the morning of the second day of the week] to the court! The Sages watched over the interests of the daughters of Israel so that [the bridegroom] should prepare for the feast three days, 
on the first day in the week, the second day in the week, and the third day in the week, and on the fourth day he marries her.
And now that we have learned that the sages “watched over the interests” that which we have learned: If the time arrived and they were not married, they eat of his [food] and they eat of terumah, if the time arrived on the first day of the week, since he cannot marry her, he does not give her food.
Therefore, if he became ill or she became ill, or she began to menstruate, he does not give her food.
There are those who put this as a question:
If he became ill, what is [the law]? 
There the reason [he need not support her,] is because he is forced, and here too, he is also forced?
Or perhaps
there he was forced by an enactment which the Rabbis enacted, but here, he is not? 
And if you say:  If he became ill he provides her with food, [then the question would still be] if she became ill, what is [the law]? 
Can he say to her,
I am here? Or, perhaps, she can say to him, “His field has been flooded”?
And if you will say [that] she can say to him, “His field has been flooded” [then the question is,] if she began to menstruate, what is the law? 
During her regular time there is no question that she cannot say to him, 

Daf 2b

During her regular time there is no question that she cannot say to him, “His field has been flooded. 
When is the question asked? Not during her regular time, what is [the law]?
Since it is not during her regular time, she can say to him, “His field has been flooded”? Or, perhaps, since there are women who change their periods, it is as if it was her regular time?
R. Ahai answered: [The mishnah states]: 
“When the time came and they were not married, they eat of his food and they eat of terumah.”
It does not state: They [the men] did not marry them [the women], rather [it says] “They [the women] were not married.” What is the case? If they delayed [the marriage] why should they eat of his food and eat of the terumah? 
Therefore, you must say that they were forced as in this case, and it states
“they eat of his food and they eat of terumah”?
R. Ashi said:
Indeed I can say [that] 
in the case of any forced [delay] she does not eat [of his]. And [the mishnah refers to a case where] they [the men] delayed. And it should have stated, “They [the men] did not marry [the women].” But since the first clause refers to them [the women], the latter clause also speaks of them [the women].
Rava said: 
And with regard to divorce it is not so. 
thus Rava holds [that] 
“force” is not a claim in regard to divorce.
From where does Rava get this [rule]? 
If we say, from what we have learned: 
“Behold this is your get if I do not come back from now until twelve months,” and he died within twelve months, there is no divorce. 
[And we would conclude from this that only if] he died there is no divorce, but if he became ill there is a divorce. 
But perhaps I could say to you [that] 
if he became ill there would also be no divorce. And it teaches us that
 there is no divorce after death.
[That] there is no divorce after death, it taught us earlier: 
“Behold, this is your get if I die,” [or] “Behold, this is your get [if I die] from this illness,” [or] “Behold, this is your get after [my] death,” he has not said anything.
[But] perhaps [that mishnah] excludes from the opinion of our rabbis, 
for it has been taught:
Our rabbis allowed her to marry again. And we said:
Who are ‘our rabbis? 
Rav Judah said [that] Shmuel said:
The court that allowed the oil [of gentiles]. 
They hold like R. Yose who said,
“The date of the document attests to [when it is effective].
Rather [he derives it from the] later clause: 
This is your get]  from now if I do not come [back] from now [and] until twelve months,” and he died within the twelve months, it is a divorce.
[And we may deduce] “if he died,” and the same rule applies if he became ill. 
[But] perhaps [the divorce is effective] only when he died, because he did not want her to be liable to [marry] the levir (yavam).
But [rather deduce] from here: 
here was a certain [man] who said to them:  “If I do not come [back] from now until thirty days it shall be a divorce.” He came [back] at the end of thirty days but the ferry prevented him [from crossing]. He said to them,
“Look, I have come [back]; look, I have come [back]!”  
Shmuel said:
This is not regarded as having come back.
But perhaps a case of “force” which is frequent  is different, for since he ought to have stipulated it and he did not stipulate it, he caused himself a loss.
Rather [we must say] Rava stated his own opinion: On account of modest women and on account of loose women.  
On account of modest women, because if you will say that it should not be a divorce.  

Daf 3a

sometimes [it may happen] that he was not held back by an accident, and she would think that he was held back by an accident  and she would be an agunah, and sit waitng for him.
And on account of loose women, because if you will say [that] it should not be a divorce, sometimes [it may happen] that he was held back by force and she would say that he was not held back by force and she would go and get married, and the result would be [that] the divorce was invalid and her children [from the second marriage] would be mamzerim.
But is there anything that according to the law of the Torah it would not be a divorce   and on account of “chaste women” and on account of “loose women” we allow a married woman to the world?
Yes, everyone who betroths, does in accordance with the laws of the rabbis, and the rabbis have annulled his betrothal.
Ravina to R. Ashi:
This makes sense [if] he betrothed her with money, [but if] he betrothed [her] by act of marriage, what can one say [then]?
The rabbis have made his act of marriage [an act of] fornication.
There are those who say: Rava said: 
And so [also] with regard to divorce.
Therefore Rava holds
[that the plea of] force does apply to divorce.  They objected:
“Behold this is your get if I do not come [back] from now [and] until twelve months,” and he died within twelve months, there is no divorce.
If he dies there is no divorce, but if he became ill there would be a divorce
[That] there is no divorce after death a previous Mishnah teaches.
Indeed I might say that if he became sick there would be no divorce either, and [the Mishnah] teaches us this that there is no divorce after death.
Perhaps [that is] to exclude from that of our teachers.
Come and hear: 
“[This is your get] if from now if I have not come [back] from now [and] until twelve months,” and he died within the twelve months it is a divorce.
Would not the same rule apply if he became ill?
No, only if he died, because he did not want his wife to become subject to levirate marriage.
Come and hear:
A certain [man] said to them:
“If I do not come [back] from now [and] until thirty days it shall be a divorce.” He came [back] at the end of thirty days but the ferry prevented him [from crossing]. And he said to them,
“Look, I have come [back]; look, I have come [back]!”
And Shmuel said:
This is not regarded as having come back.
An accident which is frequent is different, for since he should have stipulated it and he did not stipulate it, he caused himself the loss.
Shmuel b. Yitzchak said:
They only taught this from the enactment of Ezra and after, [according to which] the courts sit only on the second day and on the fifth day [of the week].
But before the enactment of Ezra, when the courts sat every day, a woman could be married on any day.
Before the enactment of Ezra, what there was there was!
This is what 
he means: 
If there are courts that sit now as before the enactment of Ezra, a woman may be married on any day.
But what about the issue of “they watched diligently over…”?
This is in a case where he already prepared [for the feast].

Daf 3b

What does it mean “they watched diligently over”?
As it has been taught:
Why did they say that a virgin is married on the fourth day? So that if he has a virginity claim he could go early the [next morning] to the court.
But let her be married on the first day of the week and if he has a virginity claim he could go early [on the morning of the second day of the week] to the court?
The Sages watched diligently over the interests of the daughters of Israel so that [the man] should prepare for the feast three days,
the first day of the week, and the second day of the week, and the third day of the week, and on the fourth day he marries her.
And from [the time of] danger the people had a custom to marry on the third day and the sages did not stop them.
And on the second day [of the week] he shall not marry; and if on account of duress it is allowed.
And on the second day [of the week] he shall not marry; and if on account of duress it is allowed.
What [was the] danger?
If I say that they said, 
If I say that they said,  then why does it just say that “they made it a custom”? 
Let them abolish it entirely!
Rabbah said:
[That] they said: A virgin that gets married on the fourth day [of the week] shall first have sexual intercourse with the governor.
Is this danger?
This is duress!
Because there are chaste women who would rather surrender themselves to death and [thus] come to danger.
But teach them that [in a case of] duress [it] is allowed?
There are loose women and there are also priestesses.
But [then] let them abolish it?
A decree is likely to be annulled, and [therefore] we do not abolish an enactment of the rabbis on account of a decree.
If so, on the third day he [the governor] would also come and have intercourse [with the bride]?
Out of doubt he does not move himself.
“And on the second day [of the week] he should not marry; but if on account of duress it is permitted.”
What is “duress”?
If you say [that it is] that which we have said, there it is called “danger” and here it is called “duress”?
And further, there [it states], “they made a custom” but here, “it is allowed”!
Rava said:
They say: “A general has come to town.” 
What is the case?
If he comes and passes by, let it be delayed.
It is not necessary [to state this but] that he came and stayed.
Let him, [then], marry on the third day [of the week]!
His vanguard arrived on the third day.
And if you want I can say:
And if you want I can say:
If his bread was baked and his meat slaughtered and his wine mixed and the father of the bridegroom or the mother of the bride died, they bring the dead [person] into a room and the bridegroom and the bride into the huppah

Daf 4a

 and he has the mandated act of intercourse and then separates from her. And [then] he observes the seven days of the [wedding] feast and after that he keeps the seven days of mourning. 
And [during] all these days he sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women. 
And they do not withhold jewellery from the bride all the thirty days. 
[But this is] only [if] the father of the bridegroom or the mother of the bride [died], because there is [then] no one who should prepare for them [for the wedding], but not [in case of] the reverse.
Rafram b. Papa said [that] R. Hisda said: 
They taught [this] only when water had [already] been put on the meat, 
but if water had not [yet] been put on the meat, it is to be sold.
Rava said:
And in a city, although water had been put on the meat, it is sold.
Papa said:
And in a village, although water had not been put on the meat, it is not sold.
But where [then] will you find [the rule] of R. Hisda?
Ashi said:
For instance, [in] Mata Mehasia, which is neither a city nor a village.
It has been taught according to R. Hisda: 
If his bread was baked and his meat prepared and his wine mixed and water had been put on the meat and the father of the bridegroom or the mother of the bride died, they bring the dead [person] into a room and the bridegroom and the bride into the bridal chamber, and he has the mandated act of intercourse and [then] separates [himself from her]. And [then] he keeps the seven days of the [wedding-] feast and after that he keeps the seven days of mourning.
And all these days he sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women.
And so [also] if his wife became a menstruant he sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women.
And they do not withhold jewelry from the bride all the thirty days.
In any case he should not have relations with her on Friday night or Saturday night.
The master said [above]:
He sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women.
This supports R. Yohanan,
for R. Yohanan said:
Although they said [that] there is no mourning on a festival, he keeps [mourning] in private.
Joseph the son of Rava expounded in the name of Rava: 
They taught this only if he had not yet had intercourse with her but if he had [already] intercourse, his wife may sleep with him.
But here we are dealing with a case where he had intercourse, and it still it teaches [that]
 he sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women?
When did he say [this]? With regard to his wife becoming a menstruant.
But it teaches:

Daf 4b

And so [also if his wife became a menstruant].
This is what he means to say: And so [also], if his wife became a menstruant and he had not yet had intercourse [with her] he sleeps among the men and she sleeps among the women.
Is this [then] to say mourning is lighter in his eyes than menstruation? 
Did not R. Yitzchak the son of Hanina say that R. Huna said: 
All kinds of work which a wife performs for her husband, a menstruant may perform for her husband, except mixing the cup, making the bed and washing his face, his hands and his feet;
But with regard to mourning it has been taught: 
Although they said: 
A man may not force his wife to paint [her eyes] or rouge [her face], in truth they said:
 She may mix him a cup and make his bed and wash his face, his hands and his feet?
[This is] not difficult: Here [it speaks] of his mourning, there   [it speaks] of her mourning.  
But it says: “The father of the bridegroom or the mother of the bride [died]”? 
This refers to the rest.
But is there a difference between his mourning and her mourning?
Has it not been taught:
If a man’s father-in-law or mother-in-law died, he cannot force his wife to paint [her eyes] and to rouge [her face]. Rather he turns over his bed and keeps mourning with her.
And so [also] if a woman’s father-in-law or mother-in-law died she is not allowed to paint [her eyes] and to rouge [her face], but she turns over her bed and keeps mourning with him!
Teach with reference to his mourning:
He sleeps among the men and his wife sleeps among the women.
But it says: And so too?  
This refers to paint and rouge.
But it says with him! Does this not mean with him in one bed?
No, [it means] with him in one house, 
and as Rav said to his son Hiyya:
In her presence keep mourning, in her absence do not keep mourning. 
Ashi said:
Can you really compare this mourning with ordinary mourning?
Ordinary mourning is strict and he would not deal lightly with it.
[But] this mourning, since the rabbis were lenient [about it], he might come to deal lightly with it.
What is the leniency? 
 Shall I say because it teaches that he has the mandated act of sex and then separates [from her]?
 That is because he has not yet become obligated in mourning, if according to R. Eliezer, [the mourning does not begin] until the body has been taken out of the house, and if according to R. Joshua, [the mourning does not begin] until the rolling stone has been closed!
Rather [the leniency is this,] because it teaches: 
He keeps [first] the seven days of the [wedding] feast and after that he keeps the seven days of mourning.
The master said: 
 In any case he many not have first intercourse on the eve of Shabbat or in the night following Shabbat. 
It makes on the eve of Shabbat, because of a wound. But in the night following the Shabbat, why not?
Zera:

Daf 5a



Daf 5b

he should plug his finger into his ears
And this is the same thing that R. Elazar said:
Why do the fingers of man resemble pegs?
What is the reason?
 Shall I say because they are divided? [Surely] each one has been made for its own purpose! For the Master said: 
This one is zeret, this one is kemitzah, this one is amah, this one is etzba and this one is gudal.
Rather, [the question is] why [are the fingers] curved like pegs? 
That if one hears an unworthy thing he shall plug his fingers into his ears.
A tanna of the school of R. Ishmael taught:
Why is the whole ear hard and the ear-lap soft
[So] that if a person hears an unworthy thing he shall bend the ear-lap into it. 
Our Rabbis taught:
A man shall not let his ears hear idle things, because they are burned first of [all] the organs. 
The question was asked: 
Is it allowed to have sex for the first time on Shabbat? Is the blood [in the womb] stored up, or is it the result of a wound?
And if you will say [that] the blood is stored up [in the womb, then the question is:] does he need the blood, and it is allowed: or does he need the opening, and it is forbidden?
And if you will say [that] he needs the blood and the opening comes of itself, [then the question is:] Does the halakhah follow R. Shimon who says: A thing which is not intended is
allowed; or does the halakhah follow R. Judah who says: 
A thing which is not intended is forbidden?
And if you will say [that] the halakhah is according to R. Judah [then the question is], do damage in regard to the opening, or does he improve in regard to the opening? 
There are those who state the question this way:
And if you will say that the blood is the result of a wound [then the question is], does he need the blood and it is forbidden, or is he concerned with his own pleasure, and it is allowed?
And if you will say [that] he is concerned with his own pleasure and the blood comes out of itself, [then the question is] does the halakhah follow R. Judah or does the halakhah follow R. Shimon?
And if you will say [that] the halakhah follows R. Judah, [then the question is,] does he do damage by [making] the wound, or does he improve by [making] the wound?
And if you will say [that] he does damage by [making] the wound, [then the question is,] with regard to one who does damage, does the halakhah follow R. Judah? 

Daf 6a

Or does the halakhah follow R. Shimon?
It was stated: in the school of Rav they said:
Rav permitted and Shmuel forbade. 
In Nehardea they said:
Rav forbade and Shmuel permitted.
Nahman b. Yitzchak said: And your sign is:
These are lenient on themselves, and these are lenient on themselves.
But does Rav permit it?
Did not R. Shimi b. Hezekiah say in the name of Rav: 
[As regards] that stopper of the brewing vat, it is forbidden to squeeze it in on a festival day!
In that [case]  even R. Shimon admits [that it is forbidden], 
for Abaye and Rava, both of them say:
R. Shimon admits [that it is forbidden] in [a case of] “If he cuts off its head, will it not die.”
[But] R. Hiyya the son of Ashi said [that] Rav said:
The halakhah is according to R. Judah,   and R. Hanan the son of Ammi said that Shmuel said:
The halakhah is according to R. Shimon.
And R. Hiyya the son of Avin taught it without [naming the] men: 
Rav said the halakhah is according to R. Judah and Shmuel said
the halakhah is according to R. Shimon?
In any case Rav holds like R. Judah, according to the version that says, 
“the blood is stored up [in the womb],” he does damage to the opening,
[and] according to the version that says, “the blood is the result of a wound,” he does damage in [making] the wound.
Hisda objected:
If a young girl, whose age of menstruation has not arrived, married: Bet Shammai says:
she is allowed four nights; And Bet Hillel says: 
until the wound is healed.
If the age of her menstruation has arrived and she married: Bet Shammai says:
 she is allowed the first night;
And Bet Hillel says: 
four nights, until after Shabbat.

Daf 6b

[Now] does it not  mean that if he had not yet had intercourse [with his wife] he may have intercourse [with her] even on Shabbat?
Rava said:
No, except for Shabbat.
Abaye said to him:
But it says: “until the night following Shabbat, four nights!”
Rather Rava said:
Rather Rava said:
 If already had intercourse, what does it teach us?
It teaches us that it is permitted to have intercourse on Shabbat, as with the [statement] of Shmuel,
for Shmuel said:
One may enter into a narrow opening on Shabbat, although  he causes pebbles to break loose.
Joseph objected: 
A bridegroom is exempt from the reading the Shema in the first night until after Shabbat, if he has not performed the act.
Is it not because he is anxious to have intercourse?
Abaye said to him:
No; he is anxious because he has not had intercourse.
Rava said to him:
And on account of anxiety [only] he is exempt [from the Shema]?
If this were so, then if his ship sank in the sea, he would also be exempt!
And should you say that this is so, did not R. Abba b. Zabda say [that] Rav said: 
A mourner is obligated to observe all the mitzvot stated in the Torah except tefillin because it is said with regard to them an “ornament” (Ezekiel 24:17).
Rather Rava said: 
This is a dispute of tannaim,
for one teaches:
If he did not do the act on the first night, he is exempt [from the Shema] also in the second night;  in the second night, he is exempt [from the Shema] also in the third night.
And another teaches:
In the first and second night he is exempt, but in the third night he is obligated to read Shema.
And Abaye? 
He could hold that there they also differ with regard to anxiety.
And these tannaim [are] like those tannaim,
as it has been taught:
He who marries a virgin should not have first intercourse on Shabbat, but the Sages allow [it].
He who marries a virgin should not have first intercourse on Shabbat, but the Sages allow [it].
Rabbah said:
It is R. Shimon, who says:
A thing which is not intended is allowed.
Abaye to him:
But R. Shimon agrees [that it is forbidden] in a case of “If its head was cut off will it not die”!
He said to him:
Not like those Babylonians who are not skilled in moving to the side, rather there are some who are skilled in moving to the side.
If so, why would he be anxious?
This refers to one who is not skilled.
[Then] let them say: One who is skilled is allowed, one who is not skilled is forbidden?
Most [people] are skilled.
Rava the son of R. Hanan said to Abaye:
If this were so, then why have groomsmen,
why have a sheet?
He [Abaye] said to him
There perhaps he will see and destroy [the tokens of her virginity].
Ammi objected: 
He who pierces an abscess on Shabbat, if in order to make an opening for it, he is liable, but if [in order] to cause pus to come out of 

Daf 7a

There it is stored up and ready to be released, here it is stored up but not ready to be released.
There it is stored up and ready to be released, here it is stored up but not ready to be released.
Ammi permitted first intercourse on Shabbat.
The Rabbis said to him:
But her kethubah is not written yet!
He said to them:
Let her seize movable goods.
Zevid permitted to have first intercourse on Shabbat. 
Others say:
R. Zevid himself had first intercourse on Shabbat.
Rav Judah permitted first intercourse on a festival.
Papi said in the name of Rava:
Do not say that on a festival it is allowed, but on Shabbat it is forbidden, for it is also allowed on Shabbat, and the event that happened, happened in that way.
Papa said in the name of Rava:
On a festival it is allowed, on Shabbat it is forbidden.
Papi said to R. Papa: 
What is your opinion? Since a wound has been permitted for a necessity it should also be permitted when there is no necessity?
If that were so, it should be permitted to put incense on coals on a festival, for since the kindling of fire has been allowed on a festival for a necessity, it should be allowed also when there is no necessity!
He said to him: 
Concerning this the verse said, “Except for that which is eaten by every person,” something that is equally used by every person.
Aha, the son of Rava, said to R. Ashi:
If this were so, then if a deer happened to come to a person on a festival, since it is not of equal usefulness for every person, it would be forbidden to kill it?  
He said to him:
I say: a thing that is needed every person, [and] a deer is needed every person.
Jacob bar Idi said:
R. Yohanan instructed in Sidon:
It is forbidden to have first intercourse on Shabbat.
And is there instruction for a prohibition?
Yes
as we have learned in a Mishnah:
Bet Hillel instructed her that she should be a Nazirite for another seven years.
Alternatively like that which has been taught: 
If the cord of the spinal column is severed in its larger portion [the animal is trefa], the words of Rabbi.
R. Jacob says:
Even if it is only perforated [the animal is trefa].
Rabbi instructed according to R. Jacob.
Huna said:
The halakhah is not according to R. Jacob.
Nahman b. Isaac taught it thus:
R. Abahu said:  R. Ishmael b. Jacob from Tyre asked R. Yohanan in Sidon, and I heard: 
Is it allowed to have first intercourse on Shabbat?
And he said to him:
It is forbidden.
And the law is:
It is allowed to have first intercourse on Shabbat.
Helbo said in the name of R. Huna in the name of R. Abba bar Zavda, in the name of Rav: 
Both a virgin and a widow requires a blessing.
But did R. Huna say this? 
Did not R. Huna say:
A widow does not require a blessing?
It is not difficult:
Here it refers to a young man who marries a widow, there to a widower who marries a widow.
And when a widower marries a widow a blessing is not required?
Did not R. Nahman say: Huna b. Natan said to me: A tanna taught: 
From where do we know that the blessing of the bridegrooms requires the presence of ten? 
Because it is said, “And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said: ‘Sit down.’ And they sat down” (Ruth 4:2). And Boaz was a widower who married a widow! 
What is it that R. Huna meant, “she does not require a blessing”? She does not require a blessing during all the seven days but on one day she requires a blessing.
But that which has been taught:
The Sages were concerned for the welfare of the daughters of Israel that he may rejoice with her for three days: when does this occur?  
If [it speaks] of a young man, did you not say seven days;  If of a widower, did you not say one day?
If you want, you may say that  
it refers to a widower: One day is for the blessing and three days are for rejoicing. And if you wish, 
you may say that it refers to a young man: Seven days are for the blessing and three days for rejoicing.


Daf 7b

They objected:
They bless over a virgin for seven days and over a widow one day.
Is this not even [in the case of] a widow who marries a young man?
No [only when the widow marries] a widower.
But [if a widow is married to] a young man, what is the rule?
Seven days? If that is so, let it be taught: They say the blessing for a virgin for seven days, and for a widow who marries a young man seven [days], and for a widow [who marries a widower] one day?
It taught a decided thing: That there is no virgin who has less than seven days and there is no widow who has less than one day.
The above text says: R. Nahman say:
Huna b. Natan said to me: A tanna taught:
From where do we know that the blessing of the bridegrooms requires the presence of ten? Because it is said, “And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said: ‘Sit down.’ And they sat down” (Ruth 4:2).
But R. Abahu said from here:
“In assemblies you shall bless God, the Lord, from the fountain of Israel” (Psalms 68:27). And R. Nahman, what does he expound with verse used by R. Abahu?
He requires it for the following teaching:
R. Meir used to say:
From where do we know that even fetuses in the wombs of their mothers sang a song by the sea?
Because it is said, “In assemblies you shall bless God, the Lord, from the fountain of Israel” (Psalms 68:27).”
And the other one? If [that were] so, let the verse say, “From the womb.” Why “from the fountain”? Concerning the matters of the fountain.
And R. Abbahu how does he expound that verse of R. Nahman? He requires it for expounding:
An Ammonite, and not an Ammonitess, a Moabite, and not a Moabitess. 
For if you would think that he needed ten to recite the blessing, would it not have been sufficient for them not to be elders?
And the other one?
If you would think [that the verse was to be used] for that midrash, would it not have been sufficient if there had not been ten [persons]?
Yes, to publicize the matter,
and as Shmuel said to R. Hanna of Baghdad:
Go out and bring me ten and I will say to you in their presence;
If one assigns [property] to an embryo, it acquires it.
But the law is:
If one assigns [property] to an embryo, it does not acquire it.      
Our rabbis taught: 
The bridegrooms’ blessing is recited in the house of the bridegroom.  
Judah says:
Also in the house of the betrothal they bless it.
Abaye said:
And in Judah they taught [R. Judah’s opinion] because [in Judah] he is secluded with her.
Another [baraita] teaches:
The bridegrooms’ blessing is said in the house of the bridegrooms and the blessing over betrothal
in the house of betrothal. [As to] the blessing over betrothal, what does one bless?
Rabin b. R. Adda and Rabbah son of R. Adda both said in the name of Rav Judah:
 Blessed are You, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who has sanctified us by His commandments and has commanded us concerning the forbidden relations and has forbidden to us the betrothed   and has allowed to us the married through huppah and kiddushin.
Aha the son of Rava, concludes it in the name of Rav Judah: 
Blessed are You, O Lord, who sanctifies Israel through huppah and kiddushin.
He who does not conclude [holds that] it is like the blessing over deriving benefit and the blessing [said on performing] mitzvot. And he who concludes [holds that] it is like kiddush.
Our Rabbis taught:
They bless the bridegrooms’ blessing in the presence of ten persons all the seven days.
Rav Judah said:
And that is only if new guests come.
What does he bless?
Rav Yehudah said: Blessed are You, LORD, our God, sovereign of the universe,

Daf 8a

who created everything for His Glory. [Blessed are You, LORD, our God, sovereign of the universe,] who creates man. [Blessed are You, LORD, our God, sovereign of the universe,] who creates man in your image, fashioning perpetuated life. Blessed are You, LORD, creator of man. May the barren one exult and be glad as her children are joyfully gathered to her (in haste). Blessed are You, LORD, who gladden Zion with her Children. Grant perfect joy to these loving companions, as you did your creations in the Garden of Eden. Blessed are You, LORD, who grants the joy of groom and bride. Blessed are You, LORD, our God, sovereign of the universe, who created joy and gladness, groom and bride, mirth, song, delight and rejoicing, love and harmony and peace and companionship. Soon, LORD our God, may there ever be heard in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem voices of joy and gladness, voices of groom and bride, the jubilant voices of those joined in marriage under the bridal canopy, the voices of young people feasting and singing. Blessed are You, LORD, who causes the groom to rejoice with his bride. 
Levi came to the house of Rabbi at the wedding-feast of R. Shimon his son [and] said five blessings.  
Assi came to the house of R. Ashi at the wedding-feast of Mar his son [and] said six blessings.
Shall we say that they argue about this: One holds that there was one formation, and the other holds that 
there were two formations?
No. All agree that there was only one formation, [but they disagree over this:] 
One holds that we go according to the intention, and the other holds [that] 
we go according to the act,
as in the statement of Rav Judah who contrasted the following verses:
It is written, “And God created man in His own image,” (Genesis 1:27) and it is written, “Male and female He created He them” (Genesis 5:2). How is this [to be understood]?
In the beginning it was God’s intention to create two human beings, and in the end only one was created. 
Rav Ashi came to the house of Rav Kahana. The first day he said all the blessings. From then and on; if there were new guests he said all the blessings, but if not it is just a continuation of the same joy he blesses, “In whose dwelling there is joy” and “Who has formed.”
From the seventh day to the thirtieth day whether he said to them “Because of the wedding”   or whether he did not say to them “Because of the wedding,” one says the blessing “In whose dwelling there is joy.”
From then and on: If he said to them “Because of the wedding” he says the blessing “In whose dwelling there is joy,” but otherwise not.
And if he says to them “Because of the wedding,” until when [do they say the blessing]? 
Rav Papi in the name of Rava: 
Twelve months, a year.
And at the outset from when [do they recite the special blessing]? 
Rav Papa said:
From the time that they put barley into the mortar.
But is this so? 
Did not Rav Papa busy himself for his son Abba Mar and say the blessing from the time of the betrothal?
It was different [in the case of] Rav Papa, for all the preparations were made for him.
Ravina busied himself [preparing for the wedding] for his son in the house of Rav Habiba and said the blessing from the time of the betrothal. 
He said:
 I am sure with regard to them that they will not retract [the betrothal]. The matter was not successful and they did retract.
Rav Tahlifa of the West, came to Babylon [and] said six long blessings.  
But the law is not according to him.
Rav Habiba came into the house of a circumcision [and] said the blessing “In whose dwelling there is joy.” But the law does not follow him, since they are distressed because the child has pain.
Rav Nahman said in the name of Rav: 
Bridegrooms count in the minyan, and mourners do not count in the minyan.  
They objected:
Bridegrooms and mourners count in the minyan!
You cast a baraita against Rav? Rav is a Tanna and disagrees.
It was stated: R. Yitzhak said that R. Yohanan said:
Bridegrooms count in the minyan, but mourners to do not count in the minyan.
They objected:
Bridegrooms and mourners count in the minyan!

Daf 8b

That was taught with regard to birkat hamazon and R. Yohanan referred to the line [in which mourners are comforted].
But what about the statement of R. Yitzhak in the name of R. Yohanan: 
They say the blessing of the bridegrooms in the presence of ten and the bridegrooms count in the minyan, and they say the blessing of the mourners in the presence of ten and the mourners do not count in the minyan.
Is there a blessing said in the line of comforters? 
Rather, R. Yohanan made that statement with regard to the [blessing recited in the] plaza.
But what about the statement of R. Yitzhak in the name of R. Yohanan:
They say the blessing of the bridegrooms in the presence of ten all the seven [days] and the bridegrooms count in the minyan and they say the blessing of the mourners in the presence of ten all seven and the mourners do not count in the minyan. Is the blessing [recited in] the plaza? 
It is possible in the presence of new guests.
As in the case of R. Hiyya bar Abba, [who was] the teacher of written Torah to the son of Resh Lakish, or, as some say, the teacher of oral Torah to the son of Resh Lakish. 
 A child of his died.
The first day [of mourning] he [Resh Lakish] did not go to him. The next day he [Resh Lakish] took with him Judah the son of Nahmani, his meturgaman. He said to him:
Rise, say something about the child.
He began to speak:
“And the Lord saw and spurned, because of the provoking of His sons and His daughters” (Deuteronomy 32:19). A generation in which the fathers spurn the Holy One, blessed be He, He becomes angry with their sons and their daughters and they die when they are young.
And some say 
he was a young man and that this is what he said to him:
“Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall He have compassion on their fatherless and widows; for everyone is profane and an evil doer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this His anger is not turned away, but His hand is stretched out still” (Isaiah 9:16). What is the meaning of “but His hand is stretched out still”?
Rav Hanan bar Rav said:
All know why a bride goes into the bridal chamber, but whoever disgraces his mouth and lets a disgraceful word out of his mouth even if a decree of seventy years of happiness were sealed for him it is turned for him into evil.
He came to comfort, he caused him pain?
This is what he said to him:
You are important enough to be punished for the sins of the generation.
He said to him:
Rise, say something with regard to the praise of the Holy One, blessed be He.
He spoke and said:
The God, who is great in the abundance of His greatness, mighty and strong in an abundance of awesome deeds, who revives the dead with His word, who does great things that are beyond knowing and wondrous works without number. Blessed are you, O Lord, who revives the dead.
He said to him:
Rise, say something with regard to the mourners.
He spoke and said: 
Our brethren, who are worn out, who are crushed by this bereavement, set your heart to consider this:
This is what stands forever, it is a path from the six days of creation. Many have drunk, many will drink, as the drinking of the first ones, so will be that of the last ones. 
Our brethren, may the Lord of consolation comfort you. Blessed be He who comforts the mourners.
Abaye said:
Let him say, “Many have drunk” but “many will drink”  he should not say;
Let him say, “the drinking of the first ones,” but “the drinking of the last ones” he should not say, 
for R Shimon, the son of Lakish said, and so it was taught in the name of R. Yose: 
A person should never open his mouth to Satan.
Rav Joseph said:
What is the verse, “We would have been like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah” (Isaiah 1:9)? What did He reply unto him? “Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom” (Isaiah 1:10).
He said to him:
Rise, say something with regard to the comforters of the mourners.
He spoke and said:
Our brethren, performers of acts of loving kindness, children of performers of acts of loving kindness, who hold fast to the covenant of Abraham our father [as it is said, “For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children…” (Genesis 18:19)],
our brethren, may the Lord of reward pay you your reward.  Blessed are you who pays a reward.
He said to him:
Rise, say something with regard to the whole of Israel. 
He spoke and said:
Master of the world, redeem and save, deliver and help Your people Israel from pestilence,   and from the sword, and from plundering, and from the blast, and from the mildew, and from all kinds of calamities that come into the world. 
Before we call, You answer. Blessed are you who stops the plague.
Ulla said, and some say it was taught in a baraita:
The sages established ten cups of wine for the house of the mourner: 
Three before the meal in order to open up the stomach, three during the meal in order to soak the food in the stomach, and four after the meal: one corresponding to “who sustains,” one corresponding to the blessing over the land, one corresponding to “who rebuilds Jerusalem,” and one corresponding to “who is good and does good.”
They added to them four more cups:
ne in honor of the officers of the town, and one in honor of the leaders of the town, and one in honor of the Temple, and one in honor of Rabban Gamaliel.
They began to drink and to become intoxicated,
they restored the matter to its original state. 
What does it mean “Rabban Gamaliel?”
As it has been taught:
At first the carrying out of the dead was harder for his relatives than his death, so much so that they would leave him and run away,
until Rabban Gamaliel came and treated himself lightly, and they carried him out in garments of linen,
and then all the people followed his example and carried out the dead in garments of linen. Rav Papa said: 
And now the common practice to carry out the dead even in rough cloth worth only a zuz.
Rabbi Elazar said:

Daf 9a

He who says: I have found an “open opening” is trusted to make her forbidden for him. Why?
 It is a double doubt:
It is a doubt [whether she had the intercourse with the other man while] married to him, or before married to him. And if you say that [she had that intercourse] while married to him, there is still a doubt [whether she had intercourse] by violence or according to her own free will!
It was necessary [to state this rule] in the case of the wife of a priest. 
And if you want, you may say [that it speaks of] the wife of an Israelite, and for instance when her father received the betrothal for her when she was less than three years and one day old. 
What does teach us?
We have already learned:
One who says to a woman, "I have betrothed you [to myself]” and she says, "You did not betroth me," she is permitted to his relatives, but he is forbidden to her relatives.
What you might have said? 
There he is certain, but here he is not certain. Therefore he teaches us [this rule].
But did R. Elazar really say this? 
Did not R. Elazar say:
A woman does not become forbidden to her husband
except with warning and seclusion, as we find in the occurrence that happened?
But is this reasonable?  Was the occurrence that happened accompanied by warning and seclusion?
And furthermore,
did they prohibit her to him?
This is not a difficulty,
for thus he means to say:
A wife does not become forbidden to her husband except in the case of warning and seclusion, [and this we learn] from the occurrence that happened, where there was no warning and seclusion and therefore she was not prohibited.
But in any case, there is still a difficulty. 
Where there was warning and seclusion [she is prohibited to him] but if [he said, “I found] an open opening” she is not prohibited! 
But according to your argument you could deduce:  [In the case of] warning and seclusion, yes, [and in the case of] witnesses, no!
Rather this is what he means:
The wife does not become forbidden for her husband through one witness but through two witnesses; but in the case of warning and seclusion, even through one witness, and “an open opening” is like two witnesses.
And if you will say: 
[In the case of] the occurrence that happened why did they not declare her forbidden? There it was rape.
And if you wish you can say like that of R. Shmuel the son of Nahmani said in the name of R. Yonatan: 

Daf 9b

Everyone who goes out into the battle of the House of David writes for his wife a bill of divorce, for it is written, “And to your brethren bring greetings, and take their pledge” (I Samuel 17:18). 
What does it mean “and take their pledge”? Rav Joseph taught:
Things which are mixed between him and her.
Abaye said: 
We have also taught this: A virgin is married on the fourth day of the week.
On the fourth day, but not the fifth day. What is the reason? On account of the cooling of his temper.
With regard to what [do we care if he cools off]?
If with regard to giving her the ketubah, let him give it to her. Rather it is with regard to making her forbidden to him.
And when he claims a claim is it not that he claims the claim of “an open opening”?
No, [it is a case where] he claims the claim of blood.
Rav Judah said [that] Shmuel said:
If any one says: “I have found an open opening,” he is believed to cause her to lose her ketubah.
Rav Joseph: 
What does he teach us?
We have already learned this:
He who eats at his father-in-law’s [between the time of betrothal and the time of marriage] in Judaea, without witnesses, cannot [after the marriage] make a virginity, because he was secluded with her.  
In Judaea he cannot make a claim, but in Galilee he can make it.
Now in which respect? 
If to make her forbidden for him, why should he not be able to make this claim in Judaea?
 Rather it is to cause her to lose her ketubah.
And when he claims a claim, is it not that he claims the claim of “an open opening”?
No, when he claims the claim of blood.

Daf 10a

It was stated: Rav Nahman said in the name of Shmuel who said in the name of R. Shimon ben Elazar:
The rabbis enacted for the daughters of Israel, for a virgin two hundred zuz and for a widow a maneh [one hundred zuz]. 
And they believed him, so that if he said, “I have found an open opening,” he is believed.
If so, what have the Sages accomplished with their enactment?
Rava said:
The presumption is [that] no one will take the trouble of preparing a wedding feast and will then spoil it.
It was taught:
Since it is a fine instituted by the sages she collects only from the worst land  [of the husband’s estate].
A fine!
Why is it a fine? 
Rather say:
Since it is an enactment of the sages, she collects only from the worst land [of the husband’s estate].
Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel says:
A woman’s ketubah is from the Torah.
But did Rabban Shimon ben Gamaliel really say this?
But it has been taught:
[It is written in the Torah] “He shall pay money according to the bride-price of virgins” (Exodus 22:16); that this is as much as the dowry of the virgins and the dowry of the virgins is as much as this.
 From here the Sages found a support for [the rule that] a woman’s ketubah is from the Torah. 
Rabban Shimon b. Gamaliel says:
A woman’s ketubah is not from the words of the Torah, but from the words of the scribes.
Reverse it.
And what did you see to reverse the latter? 
Reverse the former!
We have heard that R. Shimon ben Gamaliel said that the ketubah is from the Torah, for we learned: 
Rabban Shimon b. Gamaliel says: 
He gives her [the ketubah] in Cappadocian coins.
And if you wish, you may say:
The whole of it follows Rabban Shimon b. Gamaliel and it is defective and it teaches thus:
From here the sages found a support from the Torah for a woman’s ketubah.
The ketubah of a widow is not from the Torah but from the words of the scribes, for Rabban Shimon b. Gamaliel says:
The ketubah of a widow is not from the words of the Torah but from the words of the scribes.
A certain man came before R. Nahman and said to him:
I have found an open opening.  
Nahman answered:
Lash him with palm branches; prostitutes were available to him.
But it is R. Nahman who said that he [the husband] is believed!
He is believed, but they also lash him with palm-branches.
Ahai answered:
Here [it refers] to a young man, there [it refers] to one was married before.
A certain came before Rabban Gamaliel [and] said to him,
I have found an “open opening”.
He [Rabban Gamaliel] answered him:
Perhaps you moved aside.
I will give you a parable: To what is this like? To a man who was walking in the deep darkness of the night [and came to his house and found the door locked]. If he moves aside [the bolt of the door] he finds it open, if he does not move aside [the bolt of the door] he finds it locked.
There are those who say [that] he [R. Gamaliel] answered him thus:
Perhaps you moved aside intentionally and you tore away the door and the bar.
 I will give you a parable: To what is this like? To a man who was walking in the deep darkness of the night [and came to his house and found the door locked];
if he moves aside [the bolt of the door] intentionally he finds it open,
if he does not move aside [the bolt of the door] intentionally he finds it locked.
A certain man came before Rabban Gamaliel the son of Rabbi [and] said to him:
My master, I have had intercourse and I have not found any blood.
She said to him: 
My master, I was a virgin.
He said to them:
Bring me that cloth. 
They brought him the cloth, and he soaked it in water and he washed it and he found on it a some drops of blood. 
He [Rabban Gamaliel] said to him [the husband]:
Go, be happy with your acquisition.
Huna Mar the son of Rava of Parazikia said to R. Ashi:
We should also do this?  
He answered him: 

Daf 10b

Our  laundry work is like their  washing.
And if you will say let us do laundry work, [my answer is] the smoothing stone will remove it. 
A certain man came before Rabban Gamaliel the son of Rabbi [and] said to him:
My master, l have had intercourse and I have not found any blood.
She [the wife] said to him:
My master, I am still a virgin.
He said to them:
Bring me two handmaids, one who is a virgin and one who was not a virgin.
They brought them to him, and he placed them upon a cask of wine.
The one who was not a virgin, the smell wafted through; the virgin, the smell did not waft through.
He [then] placed this one [the wife] also [on a cask of wine] and the smell did not waft through. He said to him:
Go, be happy with your acquisition.
But he should have examined her from the very beginning!
He had heard a tradition, but he had not seen it done in practice. And he thought, lest the matter might not be certain and it would not be proper to deal lightly with daughters of Israel.
A certain man came before Rabban Gamaliel the elder [and] said to him: My master,
I have had intercourse and I have not found any blood.
She [the wife] said to him:
My master, I am of the family of Dorkati, [the women of] which have neither blood of menstruation nor blood of virginity.
Rabban Gamaliel investigated among her women relatives and he found in accordance with her words.
He [then] said to him: 
Go, be happy with your acquisition. Happy are you that you merited a woman of the family of Dorkati.
What is [the meaning of] Dorkati? A cut-off generation. 
Hanina said:
Empty consolation Rabban Gamaliel offered that man,
for R. Hiyya taught:
As the leaven is good for the dough, so is blood good for a woman.
And one has [also] taught in the name of R. Meir: 
Every woman who has abundant blood has many children.
It was said: R. Jeremiah b. Abba said:
He [Rabban Gamaliel] said to him [the husband]: Be happy with your acquisition.
But R. Jose b. Avin said: He said to him: You have been made liable with your acquisition.  It is understandable for the one who says, You have been made liable with your acquisition,  this follows the view of R. Hanina. But according to the one who says, “Be happy”, what is the merit [of such a marriage]?
He [the husband] does not come to any doubt regarding menstruation.
Someone came to Rabbi [and] said:
My master, I have had intercourse and I have not found any blood.
She said:
My master, I was [and am] still a virgin, and it was during years of famine. 
Rabbi saw that their faces were black, [and] he gave some orders concerning them, and they brought them to a bath and gave them to eat and to drink and brought them to the bridal chamber, and he (the husband) had intercourse with her and found blood.
He  said to him:
Go, be happy with your acquisition.
Rabbi applied to them the verse:
“Their skin is shriveled upon their bodies, it is withered, it is become like a stick” (Lamentations 4:8).
1) A virgin — her kethubah is two hundred [zuz], and a widow — a maneh (100 zuz).
2) A virgin, who is a widow, [or] divorced, or a halutzah from betrothal — her kethubah  is two hundred [zuz], and there is upon her a claim of non-virginity.
GEMARA. Why [is a widow called] “almanah”? 
R. Hana of Baghdad said:
Because of the maneh (al shum maneh).
But what can be said with regard to a widow from the betrothal?
Because that one is called “almanah” this one is also called “almanah.” 
What can be said with regard to [the word] “almanah,” that is written in the Bible? 
That the Rabbis will in future enact for her a maneh.
But does the Bible speak of a thing which will be in the future?
Yes, for it is written:  “And the name of the third river is Hiddekel, that is it which goes towards the east of Ashur” (Genesis 2:14), and R. Joseph taught:
Ashur, that is Seleucia.
But was [Seleucia] already then in existence?
But because it will exist in the future. Here too because it will exist in the future. 
And R. Hana of Baghdad also said:
“Rain” (matar)—waters, saturates and enriches [the earth] and refreshes and enlarges [the fruits].
Rava the son of R. Ishmael, and some say R. Yemar the son of Shelemyah, said: 
What is the verse?   “Saturating its furrows, leveling its ridges. You soften it with showers, You bless its growth” (Psalms 65:11). 
Elazar said:
The altar removes and feeds, makes beloved, atones.
“Atones” is the same as “removes” the same meaning?  
It removes [evil decrees] and atones for sins.
Hana of Baghdad also said:
Dates warm, satisfy, act as a laxative, satisfy and do not make [one] delicate.
Rav said:
If one has eaten dates, he should not give a legal decision.
They objected:
Dates in the morning and evening are wholesome, in the afternoon they are bad, at noon there is nothing like them
and they remove three things:
evil thought, gastrointestinal disorders, and bowel disorders!
Did we say that they are no good? 
They are indeed good, only for the moment [they cause] unsteadiness.
Just like wine, for the Master said: He who has drunk one-fourth [of a log] of wine shall not give a legal decision. 
And if you wish you may say:
There is no difficulty: 
This is before a meal and that is after a meal,
for Abaye said: Mother told me:
Dates before a meal are as an axe to the palmtree, after a meal as a bar to the door.
Dasha [door]: Rava explained:
Derekh sham  [that is the way].  
Darga [stairs, ladder]: Raba explained:
Derekh gag [by way of the roof].  
Puria [bed]: R. Papa explained:
Sheparin verabin aleha [because one is fruitful and multiplies on it].
Nahman b. Isaac said: 


Daf 11a

We also teach
“aylonit”—a “duchranit” for she cannot give birth.
A female proselyte, a woman captive, and a woman slave, who have been redeemed, converted, or freed [when they were] less than three years and one day old — their kethubah is two hundred [zuz] there is upon them a claim of non-virginity.
GEMARA. R. Huna said:
A minor convert is immersed on the consent of the court.
What you might have said? That it is an advantage to him and one may act for a person in his absence to his advantage? We have learned this already: 
One may act for a person in his absence to his advantage, but one may not act for a person in his absence to his disadvantage!
What you might have said?
A non-Jew prefers a life without restraint because it is established for us that a slave certainly prefers a life without restraint, therefore, he teaches us
that this is said only in the case of an adult who has already tasted sin,
but [in the case of] a minor, it is an advantage to him.
Should we say that [this Mishnah] supports him: 
A female proselyte, a woman captive, and a woman slave, who have been redeemed, converted, or freed [when they were] less than three years and one day old?
Is it not that they immersed them on the consent of the court?
No. What are we dealing with here? A proselyte whose sons and daughters were converted with him, that it is comfortable for them to do what their father does.
Joseph said: 
When they become of age they can protest [against their conversion].
Abaye raised a difficulty: 
 A female proselyte, a woman captive, and a woman slave, who have been redeemed, converted, or freed [when they were] less than three years and one day old — their kethubah is two hundred [zuz] there is upon them a claim of non-virginity.
Now if you indeed think that when they have become of age they can protest [against their conversion], would we give her the ketubah that she may go and consume [it] in her Gentile state?
When she has become of age.  
When she has become of age, she can protest and go out [of her marriage]! 
As soon as she was of age one hour and did not protest she cannot protest any more.
Rava objected:
 These young girls receive the fine:
If a man has intercourse with mamzeret, a netinah, a Samaritan, a convert, a captive or a slave, who have been redeemed, converted, or freed [when they were] less than three years and one day old–they have to be paid the fine. 
Now if you say [that] when they have become of age they can protest, would we give her the fine that she may go and consume it in her Gentile state?
When she has become of age.
When she has become of age she can protest and go out!
As soon as she was of age one hour and did not protest she cannot protest any more.
Abaye did not say as Rava [said] because there, with regard to the fine, the reason might be that the sinner should not have any benefit.  
Rava did not say as Abaye said because in the case of the ketubah the reason might be that it   should not easy for him to send her away.
When an adult has had sexual intercourse with a young girl, or when a small boy has had intercourse with an adult woman, or a girl who was injured by a piece of wood   — [in all these cases] their kethubah is two hundred [zuz], the words of Rabbi Meir.
But the Sages say:
a girl who was injured by a piece of wood — her kethubah is a maneh.
1. A virgin, who was a widow, a divorcee, or a halutzah from marriage— her kethubah is a maneh,

Daf 11b

and there is no claim of non-virginity upon her.
A female proselyte, a woman captive and a woman slave, who have been redeemed, converted, or freed [when they were] more than three years and one day old — their kethubah is a maneh, and there is no claim of non-virginity upon her.
GEMARA. Rav Judah said that Rav said: 
A young boy who has intercourse with an adult woman makes her [as though she were] injured by a piece of wood. 
When I said this before Shmuel he said: 
There is no such thing as “injured by a piece of wood” when done by flesh.
Some teach this teaching on its own:
[As to] a young boy who has intercourse with an adult woman: Rav said:
He makes her [as though she were] injured by a piece of wood; whereas Shmuel said: 
There is no such thing as “injured by a piece of wood” when done by flesh.
Oshaia objected: 
When an adult has had sexual intercourse with a young girl, or when a small boy has had intercourse with an adult woman, or a girl who was injured by a piece of wood — [in all these cases] their kethubah is two hundred [zuz], the words of Rabbi Meir.
But the Sages say: 
a girl who was injured by a piece of wood — her kethubah is a maneh
Rava said.
It means this: When adult man has intercourse with a young girl it is nothing, for when the girl is less than this, it is like putting a finger into the eye.
But when a young boy has intercourse with an adult woman he makes her as “a girl who is injured by a piece of wood.” And “a girl injured by a piece of wood” is a dispute between R. Meir and the Sages.
Rami b. Hama said:
The dispute is only when he knew that she was [a mukat etz],
for R. Meir compares her to a mature girl, and the Sages compare her to a woman who had intercourse with a man.  
But if he did not know that she was a [mukat etz] , all agree that she receives nothing.
And why does R. Meir compare her to a mature girl? 
Let him compare her to a woman who had intercourse with a man!
[In the case of] a woman who had intercourse with a man, something had been done to her by a man; but in the case of a mukat etz, nothing had been done to her by a man.
And why do the Rabbis compare her to a woman who had intercourse with a man? Let them compare her to a mature girl!
[In the case of] a mature girl nothing whatsoever has been done to her, but in the case of a mukat etz something has been done to her. “But if he did not recognize that she was a mukat etz, all agree that she receives nothing.”
Nahman objected: 
If she says: “I was injured by a piece of wood,” and he says. ‘No, you had intercourse with a man,”
Rabban Gamaliel and R. Eliezer say [that]
she is believed.
Rather Rava said: 
Whether he knew that she was a mukat etz or did not know according to R. Meir [her ketubah is] two hundred [zuz]. 
According to the Rabbis, if he knew that she was a mukat etz, [her ketubah is] a maneh, [if] he did not know, she gets nothing. 
Rava changed his opinion, for it has been taught: 
How does the bringing out of an evil name take place? 
 He comes to court and says,
“I, So-and-so, have not found your daughter to be a virgin.”
If there are witnesses that she fornicated while betrothed to him, she gets a ketubah of a maneh. 
If there are witnesses that she fornicated while betrothed to him,
she is to be stoned! 
It means this: 
 If there are witnesses that she fornicated while betrothed to him, she is to be stoned; if she fornicated before the betrothal, she gets a ketubah of a maneh.
And R. Hiyya b. Abin said that R. Sheshet said: 
This means: If he married her in the presumption that she is a virgin and she was found to have had intercourse with a man, she gets a ketubah of a maneh.
And R. Nahman objected:
One who marries a woman and does not find her to be a virgin, and she says, “After you betrothed me I was raped and your field has been flooded,” and he says, “No, before I betrothed you, you had intercourse with a man and my acquisition was a mistake”–and she gets nothing!
And R. Hiyya b. Abin said to them: 
Is it possible! R. Amram and all the great ones of the generation sat when R. Shesheth said that teaching and they found it difficult and he   answered: 
What does it mean that it is a mistaken acquisition? In respect of two hundred [zuz], but she does receive a maneh. 
And you say that she receives nothing!
And Rava said:
He who asked [this question] has asked well, for a “mistaken acquisition” means entirely.
But [then] that [other teaching] presents a difficulty.  
Resolve it and say it this:
If there are witnesses that she fornicated while betrothed to him she is to be stoned, if she fornicated before [the betrothal], she gets nothing. If she was found to be injured by a piece of wood, she has a ketubah of a maneh.
But it was Rava who said [above that], according to the Rabbis, if he did not know that she was a mukat etz, she gets nothing!
Rather you must conclude from this that
Rava retracted that opinion.
Our Rabbis taught: 
If the first husband brought her [the bride] into his home for the sake of marriage and she has witnesses that she was not secluded with him,
or even if she was secluded with him, she did not stay with him as much time as is needed for intercourse, the second husband cannot make a virginity claim for the first [husband] had taken her into his home for the purpose of marriage. 

Daf 12a

Rabbah said:
This means that
if he married her in the presumption that she was a virgin and she was found to have had intercourse she gets a ketubah of a maneh. 
Ashi said:
In general I could say to you that she receives nothing; but it is different here, because the first one had married her.
But let us be concerned that she fornicated while betrothed to him!
Sheravia said:
For instance he betrothed her and immediately had intercourse with her.
There are those who teach this in reference to our Mishnah:
 A virgin, who was a widow, a divorcee, or a halutzah from marriage— her kethubah is a maneh, and there is no claim of non-virginity upon her.
A virgin from marriage- how is it possible?
When she was brought into the bridal chamber and no intercourse took place.
Rabbah said: This means that if he married her in the presumption that she was a virgin and she was found to have had intercourse she gets a ketubah of a maneh.
Ashi said:
In general I could say to you that she receives nothing; but it is different here, because the first one had married her.
But let us be concerned that she fornicated while betrothed to him!
Sheravia said:
For instance he betrothed her and immediately had intercourse with her.
He who teachs this in reference to the baraita, how much more [could he teach it in reference] to our Mishnah.  But he who teaches this in reference to our Mishnah might not teach it in reference to the baraita, because he could say to her,
“I have relied on the witnesses.”
He who eats with his father-in-law in Judea without the presence of witnesses cannot raise a virginity claim against his wife because he has been alone with her.
GEMARA. Since it says in the Mishnah “one who eats”, it follows that there are places also in Judea where one does not eat.  
Abaye said:
Conclude from this that in Judea, too, there are different places [with different customs].
As it was taught: R. Judah said:
In earlier times in Judea they used to leave the bridegroom and the bride alone one hour before their entry into the bridal chamber, so that he may become intimate with her,
but in Galilee they did not do so.
In earlier times in Judea they used to set up two groomsmen, one for him and one for her, in order to examine the bridegroom and the bride when they enter the bridal chamber, and in Galilee they did not do so.
In earlier times in Judea the groomsmen used to sleep in the house in which the bridegroom and the bride slept, and in Galilee they did not do so.
And anyone who did not act according to this custom could not make a virginity claim.
To which [does this refer]?
If I say [that it refers] to the first clause?  [If so,] It should have read, “He who acted [according to this custom]!”
And [if you will say that it refers] to the last clause, it should have read, “He who was not examined.”
Abaye said:
Indeed [it refers] to the first clause, and recite it [thus]:
“He who acted [according to this custom].
Rava said to him:
But it reads, “He who did not act [in this way]!”
Rather Rava said this is what it says: 
He who did not act according to the custom of Galilee in Galilee but [acted] according to the custom of Judea in Galilee cannot make a virginity claim.
R. Ashi said:
Indeed [it refers] to the last clause, and read it this way,
“He who was not examined.”
It is the same whether [the woman is] an Israelite widow or a priestly widow  — her kethubah is a maneh.
The court of the priests collected for a virgin four hundred zuz, and the sages did not protest.
GEMARA. A Tanna taught:
And the widow of a priest -her ketubah is two hundred.
But we have taught in our Mishnah:
 It is the same whether [the woman is] an Israelite widow or a priestly widow  — her kethubah is a maneh.
Ashi said: 
There were two enactments.
 At first they enacted for a virgin four hundred zuz and for a widow a maneh.

Daf 12b

When they saw that the treated them  lightly, they enacted for them two hundred zuz.
When they saw again that they stayed away from them, saying,
“Instead of marrying a priestly widow, we will rather marry the virgin Israelite,” they restored their [former] enactment.
The court of the priests, etc.: Judah said that Shmuel said: 
They did not say this only regarding the court of the priests, but even families of good lineage in Israel, if they want to do as the priests do, they may do so.
They objected:
If one wants to do as the priests do, for instance [if] the daughter of an Israelite [gets] married to a priest or the daughter of a priest [gets married] to an Israelite, one may do [so].
A daughter of an Israelite to a priest or a daughter of a priest to an Israelite [can do this] because one side belongs to the priesthood, but if the daughter of an Israelite [gets married] to an Israelite, it is not allowed!
It is a case of “not only”;
not only [is it allowed in the case of] the daughter of an Israelite [getting married] to an Israelite, who cannot say to her, “I am raising you up [to a higher social status”]; but [in the case of] the daughter of an Israelite [getting married] to a priest who can say to her, “I am raising you up [to a higher social status]” I might say that it is not allowed, therefore he teaches us that it is permitted.
If a man marries a woman and does not find her to be a virgin: She says,
 “After you betrothed me I was raped, and so your field has been washed away”
And he says,
“No, rather [it occurred] before I betrothed you and my acquisition was a mistaken acquisition” —
Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer say:
she is believed. Rabbi Joshua says:
We do not live by her mouth, rather she is in the presumption of having had intercourse before she was betrothed and having deceived him, until she brings proof for her statement.
GEMARA. It was stated: [One who says to another], “I have a maneh in your hand,” and the latter responds, “I do not know”:
Rav Judah and Rav Huna say: 
He is liable [to pay]. And R. Nahman and R. Yohanan say: 
He is exempt [from paying].  
Huna and R. Judah say:
He is liable [to pay]–in the case of “certain” and “perhaps” “certain is preferable.
Nahman and R. Yohanan say:
He is exempt [from paying]–leave the money in the possession of its present owner.
Abaye said to R. Joseph:
The opinion of R. Huna and Rav Judah corresponds with that of Shmuel,
for we have learned:
She was pregnant and they said to her,
“What is the nature of this fetus?’
[And she answered, “It is] from so-and-so and he is a priest.”
Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer say:
she is believed. 
And R. Judah said in the name of Shmuel:
The halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel.
And R. Shmuel b. Judah said to Rav Judah:
Toothy one! You said to us in the name of Shmuel [that] the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel even in the first Mishnah.
[Now what does it mean]: “Even in the first [Mishnah]”? 
Even though one could say, “Leave the money in the possession of its [present] owner” [still] Rabban Gamaliel would say: “certain” is preferable.
Shall we then say that R. Judah and R. Huna follow the opinion of Rabban Gamaliel, and R. Nahman and R. Yohanan follow the opinion of R. Joshua?
Nahman could say to you:
I follow even the opinion of Rabban Gamaliel; 
only Rabban Gamaliel says it there because there is “migo”. But what “migo” is there here?
Alternatively: Rabban Gamaliel says it only there, because we say: “Leave her in her presumptive state,” but here what presumptive state has he got?
It is also reasonable, as we have answered, that R. Nahman follows the opinion of Rabban Gamaliel,

Daf 13a

 for if it were [not] so, there would be a difficulty between one halakhah and another halakhah, for we hold [that] in civil matters the halakhah follows R. Nahman, whereas in this [case] R. Judah [said] in the name of Shmuel [that] the halakhah follows Rabban Gamaliel.
Rather, it is as we resolved, conclude [so] from this.
She says,
“I was struck by a piece of wood”,  And he says,
“No, you, rather you have been trampled by a man:”
Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer say:
she is believed, And Rabbi Joshua says:
We do not live by her mouth, rather she is in the presumption of having been trampled by a man, until she brings proof for her statement.
GEMARA. What are their claims?
Yohanan says:
Two hundred zuz and a maneh. Elazar says:
A maneh and nothing.
Yohanan says:
Two hundred zuz and a maneh, he holds like R. Meir who says 
that whether he knew or did not know [she was a mukat etz] she gets as her kethubah two hundred zuz.
And R. Elazar says:
A maneh or nothing, because he holds like the Rabbis who say that
whether he knew of her or did not [she was a mukat etz], she gets a maneh.
It is understandable why R. Elazar does not say as R. Yohanan says because he interprets it  according to the Rabbis.But why does R. Yohanan not say as R. Elazar?
He holds that if he married her in the presumption of her being a virgin and she is found to have had intercourse, she has a ketubah of a maneh.
If so, here he would say “a maneh,” and she would say “a maneh,” and what difference would there be between his claim and her claim?
It is understandable, why, according to R. Elazar we have taught two cases [in the Mishnah]
one to exclude the opinion of Rami b. Hama, and one to exclude the opinion of R. Hiyya b. Abin in the name of R. Sheshet.
But according to R. Yohanan why are two cases necessary?
One to show you the strength of Rabban Gamaliel, and one to show you the strength of R. Joshua.
The first case to show you the strength of R. Joshua, that, although one could say there migo, she is not believed. The second case to show you the strength of Rabban Gamaliel, that, although one cannot say there migo, she is believed.
They saw her talking with someone in the marketplace, and they said to her,
“What sort of a man is he?”
And she answered, “He is so-and-so and he is a priest” —
Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer say: she is believed, 
And Rabbi Joshua says: we do not live by her mouth, rather she is in the presumption of having had relations with a natin or a mamzer, until she brings proof for her statement.
She was pregnant and they said to her,
“What is the nature of this fetus?’  
And she answered, “It is from so-and-so and he is a priest.” —
Rabban Gamaliel and Rabbi Eliezer say:
she is believed, And Rabbi Joshua says:
we do not live by her mouth, rather she is in the presumption of having had relations with a natin or a mamzer, until she brings proof for her statement.
GEMARA. What is the meaning of “talking”?
Ze’iri said:
She was secluded. R. Assi said:
She had intercourse.
It is understandable according to Ze’iri, for that is why it says, “talking.” But according to R.Assi why does it say “talking”?
It is a euphemism, as it is written: “She eats, and wipes her mouth, and says, ‘I have done no wickedness’” (Proverbs 30:20).
It is understandable according to Ze’iri that it teaches in the Mishnah two cases: “talking” and “pregnant,”
but according to R. Assi, why does the Mishnah teach two cases?
One case to declare her fit and one case to declare her daughter fit.
This goes well according to him who says that
he who declares her fit declares also her daughter fit. But according to him who says that
he who declares her fit declares her daughter unfit, what is there to say?
Assi holds like the one who says that he who declares her fit declares also her daughter fit.
1. Papa said to Abaye: 
According to Ze’iri who said: What is “talking”? She was secluded, and R. Joshua said that she is not believed, did not Rav say: 
We punish with lashes for seclusion but we do not prohibit on account of seclusion? Should we say that this does not follow R. Joshua?
You may even say that it follows R. Joshua, for they set a higher standard in matters of priestly lineage.
They objected:
If they saw her go in with someone into a hidden place

Daf 13b

or into a ruin, and they said to her,
“What sort of a man is he?”
and she answered, “He is a priest and he is the son of the brother of my father”:
Rabban Gamaliel and R. Eliezer say:
She is believed.
R. Joshua says:
We do not live by her mouth, rather she is in the presumption of having had intercourse with a natin or a mamzer, until she brings proof for her words.
It goes well according to Ze’iri, that it teaches two cases: into a hidden place or into a ruin.
But according to R. Assi who said: “she had intercourse,” why does it teach two cases?
It teaches only one case: Into the hidden place of a ruin.
But it teaches: Into a hidden place or into a ruin! 
Rather say one refers to the ruin of a town and one refers to the ruin of a field.
And they are both necessary. For if it had taught us only concerning a ruin of a town, I might have said that in this case Rabban Gamaliel declares her fit because most of the men of the town are fit with regard to her,
but in the case of  a ruin of a field, where most of the men are unfit with regard to her, I might say that he agrees with R. Joshua.
And if it  had told us only this case, I might have said that only in this case did R. Joshua say that she is not believed, but in that case I might say that he agrees with Rabban Gamaliel; therefore it was necessary to state both cases.
They objected:
This is testimony which a woman is fit to give. But R. Joshua says: 
She is not believed.
Joshua said to them:
Do you not agree that in the case of a woman who was captured, and there are witnesses that she was captured, and she says, “I am pure,” that she is not believed?
They said to him:
Yes, but
what a difference there is between this case and that case.
 In that case there are witnesses, and in this case there are no witnesses.
He said to them:
In this case too there are witnesses, for her stomach reaches up to her teeth.
They said to him:
Most non-Jews are unrestrained in sexual matters.
He said to them:
There is no guardian in sexual matters.
This applies only in the case of the testimony of the woman with regard to herself but in the case of the testimony of the woman with regard to her daughter all agree that the child is a shetuki.
What did he say to them and what did they answer him?
This they said to him:
You have answered us with regard to the pregnant woman, what will you answer us with regard to the woman whom they saw talking to a man? 
He said to them:
The woman whom they saw talking to a man is the same as the captive woman.
They said to him:
The captive woman is different, for most of the idolators are unrestrained in sexual matters.
He said to them: 
Here also, since she hid herself, there is no guardian in sexual matters.
Now in any case it teaches two cases: he woman whom they saw talking to a man and the pregnant woman! This is a refutation of R. Assi,
 this is indeed a refutation.
But let him note this difference–there most of the men are unfit with regard to her, but here most of the men are fit with regard to her!
This supports R. Joshua b. Levi, for R. Joshua b. Levi said:
He who declares her fit declares her fit even when most of the men are unfit, and he who declares her unfit declares her unfit even when most of the men are fit.
Yohanan says:
He who declares her fit declares also her daughter fit, and he who declares her unfit declares also her daughter unfit.
And R. Elazar says:
He who declares her fit declares her daughter unfit.
Rabbah said:
What is the reason of R. Elazar?
It is understandable with regard to her, she has the presumption of fitness, but her daughter has no presumption of fitness.
Elazar raised an objection to R. Yohanan:
This only applies to the testimony of the woman with regard to herself, but in the case of the testimony of the woman with regard to her daughter, all agree that the child is a shetuki.
Does this not mean a shetuki and unfit?
No, a shethuki and fit.
But is there such a thing as a shetuki who is fit?
Yes, according to Shmuel, for Shmuel said
If ten priests are standing together and one of them goes away and has intercourse with a woman, the child is a shetuki.
Now what does shetuki mean here?
Is it to say that he is “silenced” from the property of his father? This is obvious! Do we even know who his father is?
Rather it means that he is silenced from the rights of being a priest, for it is written: “And it shall be for him and for his seed after him the covenant of an everlasting priesthood” (Numbers 2513): ne whose seed legitimately descends from him, excluding this one, whose seed does not descend from him.
A betrothed couple once came before R. Joseph. She said, 
“It is from him.”  And he said: 


Daf 14a

“Yes. It is from me.”
Joseph said:
What should we be concerned about?
First, he admits, and moreover,
Rav Judah said that Shmuel said:
The halakhah is according to Rabban Gamaliel.
Abaye said to him:
And in this case, if he did not admit [that it was his], would Rabban Gamaliel declare fit?
Did not Shmuel say to Rav Judah:
Toothy one!
The halakhah is according to Rabban Gamaliel, but you should not act on it, unless most men are fit for her,
whereas here most men are unfit for her!
And according to your reasoning is not this statement in itself difficult? First he says 
‘The halackah is…” and then “do not act on it”!
Hence you must say:
The one ruling applies ab initio, the other ex post facto, and in this case it is ex post facto.
Abaye asked Rava:
Did R. Joshua say: She is not believed?
But this contradicts the following:
R. Joshua and R. Judah b. Batera testified concerning the widow [of one who was] of a mixed family that she is fit to marry a priest.
He said to him:
Now is this so?
There the woman marries, and she examines [his lineage] and [then] marries; but here the woman who is licentious; does she first examine and then act licentiously?
Rava said:
One statement of R. Joshua and the other statement of R. Joshua contradict each other, but one statement of Rabban Gamaliel does not contradict the other statement? 
But does not the concluding clause teach: Rabban Gamaliel said to them: 
We accept your testimony, but what can we do, since Rabban Yohanan b. Zakkai decreed that no court be set up for this purpose because the priests will obey you to distance but not to bring near?
Rather Rava said:
There is no contradiction between the statement of Rabban Gamaliel and the other statement of Rabban Gamaliel,
because there it is “certain” and here it is “perhaps.”
Neither is there a contradiction between the one statement of R. Joshua and the other statement of R. Joshua,
because in that case there is one doubt and here there is a double doubt.
Therefore, according to Rabban Gamaliel the “the certain” is so strong that even where there is only one doubt he declares her fit,
and the “perhaps” is so weak that even where there is a double doubt he declares her unfit.
And according to R. Joshua one doubt   is so strong that even in the case where she stakes a “certain” claim he declares her unfit, and a double doubt is so light that even in the case where she stakes a “perhaps” claim he declares her fit.
Our Rabbis taught:
Which is the widow of one of a mixed family? Anyone about whom there is no doubt on account of mamzerut, natinut or on account of slaves of the kings.
Meir said:

Daf 14b

I have heard that when there is none of these defects in the family, they may marry her into the priesthood.
Shimon b. Elazar said in the name of R. Meir and R. Shimon the son of Menasia also said it: 
Which is the widow of one of a mixed family? When a doubtful halal was mixed up in it,
for the Israelites know the mamzerim who are among them, but they do not know the halalim who are among them.
The Master said: 
Which is the widow of one of a mixed family? Anyone about whom there is no doubt on account of mamzerut, natinut or on account of slaves of the kings.
[By implication] if there is a doubt on account of a halal in the family she is fit. 
Why should these be different? Because these are Biblical? A halal is also Biblical.
And further: R. Meir said: 
I have heard that when there is none of these defects in the family they may marry her into the priesthood. This is the same as that which the first Tanna taught!
And further: R. Shimon b. Elazar said in the name of R. Meir and R. Shimon b. Menasia also said like him: 
Which is the widow of one of a mixed family? When a halal was mixed up in [his lineage], for the Israelites know the mamzerim who are among them, but they do not know the halalim who are among them. But it says in the first clause [that if there is a doubt regarding] a halal [in the family], she is fit to marry into the priesthood!
Yohanan said: 
There is a difference between them concerning a person who when he is called a mamzer protests and when he is called a halal is silent.
The first Tanna holds that every person who when called “unfit” is silent is considered unfit, and thus the first Tanna said:
Which is the widow of one of a mixed family? When with regard to her there is no one who is silent if he is called mamzer or natin, or slave of the king, or halal.
Our Rabbis taught: 
Which is the widow of one of a mixed family? Anyone about whom there is no doubt on account of mamzerut, natinut or on account of slaves of the kings.  
Meir said:
I have heard that when there is none of these defects in the family, they may marry her into the priesthood.
Shimon b. Elazar said in the name of R. Meir and R. Shimon the son of Menasia also said it:
Which is the widow of one of a mixed family? When a doubtful halal was mixed up in it, for the Israelites know the mamzerim who are among them, but they do not know the halalim who are among them.
The Master said: Which is the widow of one of a mixed family? Anyone about whom there is no doubt on account of mamzerut, natinut or on account of slaves of the kings.
And R. Shimon b. Elazar said to the first Tanna of R. Meir: 
If you have heard that R. Meir declares the person fit in the case of silence, this is not when he is called halal and is silent, but when he is called mamzer and is silent. And why is he silent? Because he says to himself. a mamzer is well-known.  
But if he is called mamzer and he protests or he is called halal and is silent he is unfit, for the reason he is silent is because he thinks,
it is enough if he is not excluded from the congregation.
One baraita taught: 
R. Yose says:If he is called mamzer and is silent, he is fit, and if he is called halal and is silent, he is unfit.
And another baraita taught: 
If he is called halal and is silent he is fit, but if he is called mamzer and is silent, he is unfit.
Rabbi Yose said:
it happened that a young girl went down to draw water from a spring and she was raped.
Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri said:
if most of the inhabitants of the town marry [their daughters] into the priesthood, this [girl] may [also] marry into the priesthood.
GEMARA. Rava said to R. Nahman:
According to whom did R. Yohanan b. Nuri say [his statement in the Mishnah]?
If according to Rabban Gamaliel, he declares her fit even when there is a majority of unfit!  And if it is according to R. Joshua, he declares her unfit even when there is a majority of fit! 
He said to him:
Rav Judah said that Rav said:

Daf 15a

The incident happened in the marketplaces of Tzippori, and this follows R. Ammi, 
for R. Ammi said:
And that is when a company of fit men passed by there, and it also follows R. Yannai
for R. Yannai said:
If she had intercourse in the marketplaces she is fit for the priesthood.
In the marketplaces, does that make sense?
Rather say:
If she had intercourse at the time of [the wagons arriving at] the marketplaces she is fit for the priesthood.
But if someone went out from Tzippori and had intercourse with her, the offspring is a shetuki.
Like the following: When R. Dimi came he said in the name of Ze’iri who said in the name of R. Hanina, and some say: Ze’iri said in the name of R. Hanina:
We go after the majority of the town and we do not go after the majority of the passing company.
Just the reverse!
These move about and these are stationary!
Rather
we go after the majority of the inhabitants of the town, but only when there is also the majority of the passing company with it,
but only when there is also the majority of the passing company with it, of the town alone, nor after the majority of the passing company alone.
What is the reason? It is a decree not to go after the majority of the passing company in order to prevent going after the majority of the inhabitants of the town.
But even in the case of the majority of the inhabitants of the town, if he, went to her, he who separates himself separates himself from the majority?  
It is only necessary when she went to him so that he was stationary, and R. Zera said:
All that is stationary is considered as half to half. 
But do we require two majorities?
Has it not been taught:
Nine [butcher] shops, all of them  sell ritually slaughtered meat and one sells meat not ritually slaughtered and he bought from one of them and he does not know from which one he bought it is prohibited because of the doubt.
But if [meat] was found, follow the majority?
And if you will say that this refers to a case when the gates of the city are not closed, so that a majority came also from outside, did not R. Zera say:
Even when the gates of the city are closed?
They added an extra degree of stringency in matters of lineage.
The text says: R. Zera said:
All that is stationary is considered as half to half. Whether this results in a leniency or in a stringency.
From where does R. Zera derive this?
If I say from [the following baraita]: nine butcher shops, all of them sell ritually slaughtered meat and one sells meat not ritually slaughtered and he bought in one of them and he does not know in which of them he bought, it is prohibited because of the doubt; But if [meat] was found, one goes after the majority? There it leads to a stringency!
Rather [he derives it] from [the following]: If there were nine frogs and one sheretz and he touches one of them and he does not know which of them he touched he is unclean because of the doubt?
There it also leads to a stringency.
But [rather] from [the following]: If there were nine sheratzim and one frog and he touches one of them and he does not know which of them he touched: In the private domain he is unclean because of the doubt; in a public domain, he is clean because of the doubt.
And how do we know this from the Torah?
The verse says: “And if he lie in wait for him and rise up against him.” [He is not guilty of murder] until he intended [to kill] him.
 And the Rabbis?
they said in the school of R. Yannai:
This excludes one who throws a stone into [a group of people].
What was the exact case?
What was the exact case? If you say there were nine non-Jews and one Israelite? Let it be sufficient for him that the majority are non-Jews.
Alternatively, if it was half and half, [the rule is that] when there is a doubt in capital cases one takes a lenient view!
Rather it is necessary when there were nine Israelites and one non-Jew, so that the non-Jew is stationary, and whatever is stationary is considered as half and half.
It was stated: R. Hiyya b. Ashi said in the name of Rav:
The halakhah follows R. Yose. And R. Hanan b. Rava said in the name of Rav:
It was a temporary decision.
Yirmiyah raised an objection: 
 And for matters of lineage we do not require two majorities?
Have we not learned: 

Daf 15b

If one found in it an abandoned child — if the majority were non-Jews [the child is] a non-Jew, if the majority are Jews [the child is] a Jew, half and half, [the child is] a Jew. 
And Rav said:
They have taught this only with regard to sustaining it, but not with regard to lineage. And Shmuel said:
[They have taught this only] with regard to removing stones from on top of it.
That which R. Judah said in the name of Rav, 
that the incident happened at the springs of Tzippori, escaped his attention.
But according to R. Hanan b. Rava who said [that] 
it was a temporary decision, it is difficult!   
He who taught this did not teach that.
The above text said: If one found in it an abandoned child — if the majority were non-Jews [the child is] a non-Jew, if the majority are Jews [the child is] a Jew, half and half, [the child is] a Jew. And Rav said: 
They have taught this only with regard to sustaining it, but not with regard to lineage. And Shmuel said: 
[They have taught this only] with regard to removing stones from on top of it.
But did Shmuel really say this?
Did not R. Joseph say that R. Judah said in the name of Shmuel:
We do not follow the majority when it comes to saving a life?
Rather when Shmuel said it, it referred to the first clause:
If the majority [of the inhabitants of the town are] non-Jews [the child is] a non-Jew. [On this] Shmuel said:
And with regard to removing stones from on top of it.
If the majority [of the inhabitants of the town consist of] non-Jews [the child is] a non-Jew: For what practical purpose [was this taught]?
Papa said:
To feed him meat not ritually slaughtered.
If the majority [of the inhabitants of the town are] Jews [the child is] a Jew: For what practical purpose [is this taught]?
Papa said:
That one returns to him a lost object.
If [the inhabitants of the town are] half and half [the child is] Jewish: For what practical purpose [is this taught]?
Resh Lakish said:
With regard to damages.  
What is the exact case?
If it was an ox of ours that gored an ox of his?  
[In this case] let him say to him: “Bring evidence that you are an Israelite — and take!”
Rather it is necessary when an ox of his gored an ox of ours:
One half he pays, and with regard to the other half he says to them:
“Bring evidence that I am not an Israelite and I will pay you.”
May we return to you “A virgin is wedded.”
A woman became a widow or was divorced. She says, 
“I was a virgin when you married me” and he says, 
“Not so, rather you were a widow when I married you”, —
If there are witnesses that she went out with a hinuma, and with her head uncovered, her ketubah is two hundred [zuz.]  
Rabbi Yohanan ben Beroka says:
the distribution of roasted ears of corn is also evidence.
And Rabbi Joshua admits that, if one says to his fellow,
“This field belonged to your father and I bought it from him”, he is believed,

Daf 16a

for the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permitted.
But if there are witnesses that it belonged to his father and he says,
“I bought it from him”, he is not believed.
GEMARA. The reason is that there are witnesses, but if there are no witnesses the husband is believed.
Shall we say that it is taught anonymously not according to Rabban Gamaliel? For if it were according to Rabban Gamaliel, did not he say that she is believed?
You may even say [that it accords with] Rabban Gamaliel: for Rabban Gamaliel says [it]  only there in a case of “certain” and “perhaps.” But here where they are both “certain” he did not say it.
But now that you have said that, why did you say that?
Clearly this is a case where they are both “certain”! 
Since most women get married as virgins [you might say that] it is like “certain and perhaps.”
This is also reasonable from that which it teaches
“and Rabbi Joshua agrees.”    
If you say that it refers to Rabban Gamaliel with whom he agrees, then it is understandable. But if you say it does not refer to Rabban Gamaliel with whom he agrees, then with whom does R. Joshua agree?
Do you think [that] R. Joshua refers to this chapter?
He refers to a “miggo” in the first chapter.
To which [does he refer]?
If you [that he refers] to this:
If she was pregnant, and they said to her:
What is the nature of this fetus?
[And she answered: It is] from So-and-so and he is a priest. 
Rabban Gamaliel and R. Eliezer say:
She is believed, [and] R. Joshua says:
We do not live from her mouth! What miggo is there in that case?
 Behold, her stomach reaches up to her teeth!  
Rather, it [might] refer to this:
They saw her talking with someone 
and they said to her: “What is the nature of this man?”
[And she answered, “He is] So-and-so and he is a priest.”
Rabban Gamaliel and R. Eliezer say:
She is believed. And R. Joshua says:
We do not live from her mouth. 
What miggo is there in that case?
This works for Ze’iri, who says
[that] “she was talking” means “she was secluded [with a man].” [In which case she has] a miggo, for if she wished she could say, “I did not have intercourse” and [still] she said, “I had intercourse,” [therefore] she is believed.
But according to R. Assi,
who says that
“she was talking” means “she had intercourse,” what miggo is there?
Rather, he might refer to this:
She says,
“I was injured by [a piece of] wood,” and he says. 
“Not so, rather you were trampled [i.e. had sex] with a man.” 
Rabban Gamaliel and R. Eliezer say:
She is believed, and R. Joshua says:
We do not live from her mouth.  
What miggo is there?
This works according to R. Eliezer, who says that [the dispute between the husband and the wife is] with regard to a maneh and nothing. She has] a miggo, for if she wished she could have said, “I was injured by a piece of wood under you [after betrothal],”  and she would get two hundred [zuz], and [still] she said [that she was injured] earlier, [therefore] she is believed.
But according to R. Yohanan who says that
[the dispute between the husband and the wife is] with regard to two hundred and a maneh, what miggo is there? 
Rather he refers to this:
If one has married a woman and has not found her to be a virgin [and] she says, 
“After you betrothed me I was raped and your field was flooded,”
and he says,
‘Not so, but rather it happened before I betrothed you.”
Rabban Gamaliel and R. Eliezer say:
She is believed, and R. Joshua says:
 We do not live from her mouth.
For [here there is] a miggo, because if she wished she could say, “I was injured by a piece of wood after betrothal,” and [by saying this] she would not make herself unfit for the priesthood and [still] she said, “I have been raped,” and she makes herself unfit for the priesthood; therefore Rabban Gamaliel said that she is believed.
And R. Joshua said to Rabban Gamaliel: 
With regard to this miggo here, I agree with you, but with regard to that miggo there, I disagree with you.
Now, this is a miggo and that is a miggo, what difference is there between this miggo and that miggo?
Here there is no slaughtered ox before you, there, there is a slaughtered ox before you.
But since most women get married as virgins, [even] if no witnesses came, why is that important?
Ravina said:
Because one could say, most women are married as virgins and a minority as widows.
And whenever a virgin gets married, it has a voice, 

Daf 16b

and since this one does not have a voice, [the presumption that she belonged to] the majority has been undermined.
But if [you maintain that] whenever a virgin gets married she has a voice, [then even] when witnesses come, what of it?
They are false witnesses!
Rather Ravina said:
Most marriages of virgins have a voice, and [in the case of] this one, since there is no voice, [the presumption that she belonged to] the majority has been undermined.
If there are witnesses that she went out with a veil (himuna), etc.
But let us be concerned that she might produce witnesses before this court and collect her ketubah and then later produce the ketubah before another court and collect [a second time] by that [document]!
Abbahu said:
That is to say
they write a receipt.
Rav Papa said:
We are dealing with a place where they do not write a ketubah.
Some teach this with regard to the following baraita:
If she lost her ketubah document, or she hid it, or it was burned: If they danced before her, played before her, passed before her the cup of [glad] tidings, or the cloth of virginity, if she has witnesses with regard to one of these, her ketubah is two hundred [zuz].
But let us be concerned that perhaps she might produce witnesses before this court and collect her ketubah and then later produce the ketubah before another court and collect [a second time] by that [document]!
Abbahu said:
That is to say
they write a receipt.
Rav Papa said:
We are dealing with a place where they do not write a ketubah.
But does it not say “If she lost her ketubah document”?
He wrote her [one].
But in the end, she will still produce it and collect [her kethubah a second time] with it!
What does it mean “she lost [it]”? [It means:] “she lost [it] in fire.”  
If so, it is the same as “it was burned!”
Furthermore,
what can you say with regard to “she hid [it]?”  
And furthermore,
why [mention] “she lost [it]”?
Rather [this is what the baraita means]:
If she lost it, it is as if she had hidden it before us, and we do not give her [the ketubah money] until witnesses say [that] her ketubah document has been burned.
He who teaches this in reference to the baraita, all the more [does he refer it] to the Mishnah. But he who teaches this in reference to our Mishnah [does] not [teach it] in reference to the baraita, because of the difficulty.
If there are witnesses, etc. But let us be concerned that perhaps she might produce witnesses of the veil before this court and collect [her ketubah] and [later] she might produce [other] witnesses of the veil before another court and collect [her ketubah a second time]!
In a case where it is not possible otherwise, we certainly write a receipt.
“[If] they passed before her the cup of glad tidings.”
What is the cup of [glad] tidings?
Rav Adda the son of Ahava said:
They pass before her a cup of wine of terumah, as if to say,
“This one is worthy of eating terumah.”
Rav Papa raised an objection:
Does not a widow eat terumah?  
Rather Rav Papa said [as if to say]:
This one is “first” just as terumah is “first”. 
It has been taught: R. Judah says:
They pass before her a cask of wine.
Rav Adda the son of Ahava said:
[If she was] a virgin they pass before her a closed one, [and if] she had had intercourse with a man they pass before her an open one.
Why?
Let us pass [a cask of wine] before a virgin and let us not pass [a cask of wine] at all before one who had intercourse?
[It could happen] some times that she would seize two hundred [zuz] and [then] say,
“I was a virgin and they did not pass [a cask of wine] before me because they were prevented by an accident.”
Our rabbis taught:
How does one dance before the bride?
Bet Shammai say:

Daf 17a

The bride as she is. And Bet Hillel say:
“A beautiful and graceful bride”!
Bet Shammai said to Bet Hillel:
If she was lame or blind, does one say of her, “Beautiful and graceful bride”?
Whereas the Torah said, “Keep away from a lie” (Exodus 23:7).
Bet Hillel said to Bet Shammai:
According to your words, if one has made a bad purchase in the market, should one praise it in front of him or denigrate it?
Surely, one should praise it in front of him.
Therefore, the sages said:
One should always have a pleasing disposition in front of other people.
When Rav Dimi came, he said:
Thus they sing before the bride in the West:
No blue makeup and no rouge and no braiding [of the hair], and still a graceful gazelle.
When the Rabbis ordained R. Zera they sang before him:
No blue makeup and no rouge and no braiding [of the hair], and still a graceful gazelle.
When the Rabbis ordained R. Ammi and R. Assi they sang before them thus:
All such as this, and all such as this ordain for us, but do not ordain for us of those who garble or babble,
and some say: of the one-fifth scholars or one-third-scholars. 
When R. Abbahu came from the Yeshiva to the court of the Emperor, handmaids from the Emperor’s house went out towards him and sang before him thus:
“Prince of his people, leader of his nation, shining light, blessed be your coming in peace!”
They tell of R. Judah b. Ilai that he used to take a myrtle twig and dance before the bride and say:
“Beautiful and graceful bride.”
Rav Shmuel the son of Rav Yitzchak danced with three [twigs].  
Zera said:
The old man is putting us to shame.
When he died, a pillar of fire came between him and the rest of the world. And we have a tradition that a pillar of fire has made such a separation only either for one in a generation or for two in a generation only. 
Zera said:
His twig (shotiteh) [benefited] the old man, and some say:
His craziness (shtuteh) [benefited] the old man, and some say:
his method (shitateh) [benefited] the old man
Rav Aha took her on his shoulder and danced [with her].
The Rabbis said to him:
Can we also do this?
He said to them:
If they are like a beam to you, [then it is] permitted and if not, [you may] not.
Shmuel b. Nahmani said [that] R. Yonatan said:
It is permitted to look at the face of the bride all the seven days in order to make her beloved to her husband.
But the halakhah is not according to him.
Our Rabbis taught:
They move aside a funeral procession to make way for a bridal procession, and both of them for the King of Israel. 
They said of King Agrippa that he made way for a bride, and the sages praised him.
They praised him, from this we can conclude that what he did was appropriate.
But did not R. Ashi say:
Even according to he who says [that] if a prince forgoes his honor, his honor is forgone, if a king forgoes his honor, his honor is not forgone
for a Master said:
You shall set over yourself a king” (Deuteronomy 17:15) [this means] that his awe shall be over your? 
It was [at] a crossroads.
Our Rabbis taught:
One interrupts the study of the Torah for the sake of a funeral procession and bringing the bride [into the huppah].
They said about R. Judah b. Ila’i that he would interrupt the study of Torah for the sake of a funeral procession and bringing the bride [into the huppah].
When is this so? When there are not sufficient people at the funeral procession,   but if there are sufficient people one does not interrupt [the study of the Torah].
And how many are sufficient?
R. Shmuel the son of Ini said in the name of Rav:
Twelve thousand men and six thousand trumpets.
And some say:
Thirteen thousand men and among them six thousand trumpets.
Ulla said:
For instance when people form a line from the city-gate to the burial place.
Sheshet, and some say R. Yohanan said: 
Its taking away is like its giving. Just as its giving was in [the presence of] sixty myriads of people, so its taking away should be in [the presence of] sixty myriads of people.
And this is the case only with regard to one who read [the Bible] and recited [the oral Torah.]  

Daf 17b

But there is no measure for one who teaches [the oral Torah].
And if there are witnesses that she went out with a hinuma etc. What is hinuma?
Surhab b. Papa said in the name of Ze’iri:
A myrtle-canopy. Yohanan said:
 A veil under which the bride naps.
Yohanan ben Beroka says, etc.
It was taught:
This was [regarded as] a proof in Judaea.
What is the proof in Babylonia?
Rav said:
The dripping of oil on the heads of the scholars. 
Papa said to Abaye:
Did the master refer to oil [used] for cleaning [the head]?
He said to him:
You orphan, did your mother not do the dripping of the oil on the heads of the scholars at the time of the event?
As that [case when] one of the scholars was occupied with the wedding of his son in the house of Rabbah b. Ulla,
and some say, Rabbah b. Ulla was occupied with the wedding of his son in the house of one of the scholars, and he dripped oil on the heads of the scholars at the time of the event.
What [sign is there at the wedding of] a widow?
Joseph taught: 
A widow has no roasted ears of grain [distributed at her wedding].
And R. Joshua agrees that if one says to his fellow etc.
But let him teach:
R. Joshua agrees that if one says to his fellow, “This field belonged to you and I have bought it from you” [he is believed]?
Because he would have to teach [in] the last clause:
If there are witnesses that it was his and he says,
“I have bought it from you” he is not believed.
[And] what was this case?
If he ate [the produce of] it [during the] years of hazakah why should he not be believed?
And if he did not eat [the produce of] it [during the] years of hazakah it is obvious that he is not believed!
If so, with regard to his father also [one could argue]: If he ate [the produce of] it [during the] years of hazakah
why should he not be believed?   And if he did not eat [the produce of] it [during the] years of hazakah, it is obvious that he is not believed!
It works with regard to [the field belonging to] his father, [because] it could happens for instance, when he ate [the produce of] it two [years] during the life of the father and one [year] during the life of his son. And [this would be] according to R. Huna, 
for R. Huna said:
One does not acquire the ownership of the property of a minor through hazakah even if [he continued in the possession after] the minor had become of age.
But does R. Huna comes to teach [what is already taught In] our Mishnah!
If you wish you may say,
R. Huna says what is to be derived from our Mishnah by implication.
And if you wish, you may say,
 “He teaches us, even if he had become of age.”
But let him teach with regard to himself and stand the case where he ate [the fruits of] it two [years] in his presence and one [year] in his absence, and, for instance, when he fled?
Because of what did he flee? 
If he fled because of [danger to his] life, it is obvious that he is not believed. since he cannot protest!
And if he fled because of money [matters] he ought to have protested because we hold [that] a protest in his absence is a [valid] protest! 
For we have learned: 
There are three regions with regard to hazakah: Judea, Trans-Jordan and Galilee. 
[If] he was in Judea and someone took possession [of his land] in Galilee, [or he was] in Galilee and someone took possession [of his land] in Judea, it is not a hazakah until he is with him in the [same] province.
And we asked concerning this, 
what does he hold?
If he holds that a protest in his absence is a [valid] protest, this should apply also to Judaea and Galilee.  
And if he holds [that] a protest in his absence is not a [valid] protest, it should not he [a valid protest] even if they are both in Judaea?
Abba bar Mamel says: 
He always holds that a protest in his absence is a valid protest,
but our Mishnah refers to a time of emergency.
And why are Judea and the Galilee different such that he mentions them?

Daf 18a

For in general Judea and the Galilee are like a time of emergency.
But let it teach:
R. Joshua admits that when one says to his fellow,
“I borrowed from you a maneh and paid it back to you” he is believed!
Because he would have to teach in the last clause:
“If there are witnesses that he borrowed from him [a maneh] and he says ‘I have paid it back,’ he is not believed.”
But we hold the principle that if one lends money to his fellow in front of witnesses, he need not pay it back to him before witnesses.
But let him teach:
R. Joshua admits that if one says to his fellow,
“I owed to your father a maneh and I returned to him half,” he is believed! 
According to whose opinion?
 If according to the opinion of the Rabbis. surely they say [that he is regarded as] one who returns a lost thing, [and] if according to R. Eliezer b. Yaakov.  Surely he says that he must take an oath! 
For it has been taught: R. Eliezer b. Yaakov says:
Sometimes a person has to take an oath because of his own statement.
How so? 
[If one says to his fellow], ‘I owed your father a maneh and I returned to him half,” he must take an oath. And this is [a case] where one takes an oath because of his own statement. 
But the Sages say: 
He is only as one who returns a lost thing and he is exempt.
And does R. Eliezer b. Jacob not hold [that] one who returns a lost thing is exempt [from an oath]? 
Rav said: 
[It speaks here of a case] when a minor claimed from him.
But did not a Master say:
One does not take an oath because of a claim by a deaf-mute, a person lacking sound senses, or a minor? 
What is [meant by] “minor”? An adult, and why does he call him a “minor”? Because with regard to the affairs of his father he is [regarded as] a minor.
If so, [it is not] “his own statement?” 
It is a claim made by others!
It is a claim [made] by others and [also] his own admission.
But all claims are really a claim made by others and one’s own admission!
They differ here with regard to [an opinion of] Rabbah, 
for Rabbah said: 
Why did the Torah say that he who admits a part of the claim must take an oath? [Because] it is assumed that no man is brazen in the face of his creditor. 
He would indeed like to deny the whole debt. But he does not deny the whole debt because no one is so brazen.

Daf 18b

He would like to admit that he owes the whole debt, and the reason he does not admit, is that he would like to elude him [for the time being]. And he thinks,
“as soon as I will have money I will pay it,”
and [therefore] the Torah said: 
Impose an oath on him, so that he should admit the whole of it.
Eliezer b. Jacob holds [that]
he is not brazen against him nor against his son, and therefore he is not like one who returns a lost thing.
And the Rabbis hold [that] 
against him he is not brazen, but against his son he might be brazen, and since he is not brazen, he is like one who returns a lost thing.
 If witnesses said,
“This is our handwriting, but we were forced, [or] we were minors, [or] we were disqualified witnesses” they are believed.  
But if there are witnesses that it is their handwriting, or their handwriting comes out from another place, they are not believed. 
GEMARA. Rami b. Hama said:
They taught this only when they said: We were forced by threats with regard to money. But if they said we were forced [by threats] to our life, they are believed.
Rava said to him: 
Does he really have this power?
Once he has once testified he cannot again testify!
And if you will say [that]
this applies only to oral testimony but not to testimony in a document, did not Resh Lakish say:
If witnesses are signed on a document it is as if their testimony had been examined in court?
Rather, if it has been said, it has been said with regard to the first clause:
they are believed. Rami b. Hama said: 
They taught this only when they said,
“We were forced [by threats] to [our] life.” But if they said,
We were forced [by threats] with regard to money” they are not believed because no one makes himself out to be wicked.
Our rabbis taught:
They are not believed to disqualify it, the words of R. Meir.
But the Sages say [that]
they are believed.
This goes well according to the rabbis, who follow their reasoning, “the mouth that prohibits is the mouth that permits,”
but what is the reason of R. Meir?
It works [with regard to] those disqualified from testifying [because] the creditor himself checks beforehand and [then] he signs.
With regard to] “minors” also [it can be explained] according to R. Shimon ben Lakish. for Resh Lakish said:

Daf 19a

It is a presumption that the witnesses do not sign a document unless [everything] was done by adults.
But when it comes to “we were under duress” what is his reasoning?
Hisda said:
R. Meir holds that
if one said to witnesses, “sign a falsehood and you will not be killed,” they should rather be killed and not sign a falsehood.
Rava said to him:
Now. if they would come to us to ask advice, we would say to them:
Go [and] sign and do not be killed,
for a Master said:
“There is nothing that comes before the saving of life except idolatry, fornication and murder.” 
Now that they have signed, can we say to them: why have you signed? 
Rather the reason of R. Meir is in accordance with what R. Huna that Rav said:
for R. Huna said that Rav said:
If he  admits that he has written the document, there is no need  to confirm it.
[To revert to] the main text: R. Huna said that Rav said:
If he admits that he has written the document, there is no need to confirm it.
Nahman said to him: 
Why do you say this in a sneaky way? 
If you hold with R. Meir, say:
the halakhah is according to R. Meir.
He said to him:
And how does the Master [you], hold? 
He said to him:
When they come before us in court, we say to them:
go [and] confirm your documents and [then] come to court.
Rav Judah said that Rav said:
If one said: This is a loan document of trust he is not believed.
Who said it?
If the debtor said it, it is obvious; why should he be believed?
If the creditor said it, may a blessing come upon him!
Rather, the witnesses said it.
If their handwriting comes out from another place, it is obvious that they are not believed,
and if their handwriting does not come out from another place, why should they not be believed?
Mnemonic: BASH)  Rava said: 
Indeed, the debtor said [it], and [it is] follows R. Huna,
for R. Huna said that Rav said:
If he admits that he has written the document, there is no need to confirm it.
Abaye said:
Indeed, the creditor said it, and it is a case where he would cause a debt to others.
And it follows R. Natan, for it has been taught: R. Nathan says:
From where [do we learn that], if one has a claim of a maneh against his fellow and that fellow against another fellow, we take from this one and give it to that one? Scripture says, “And he shall give to whom he owes” (Numbers 5:7).
Ashi said:
Indeed, the witnesses said it, and [it is in a case] where their handwriting does not come out from another place;
and when you asked why should they not be believed, it is as stated by R. Kahana, for R. Kahana said:
It is forbidden for a man to keep a loan deed of trust in his house, because it is said: “Let not unrighteousness dwell in your tents” (Job 11:14).

Daf 19b

And R. Sheshet the son of R. Idi said:
From [the words of] R. Kahana we can learn [the following]: Witnesses who said,
“Our words were [regarding a matter of] trust,” they are not believed,
or this reason: Since it is “unrighteousness,” [we say that] on unrighteousness they would not have signed.
Joshua b. Levi. said:
It is forbidden for a man to keep a paid bill of debt in his house, because it is said: “Let not unrighteousness dwell in your tents.”
In the West they said in the name of Rav: [It is said]:
“If iniquity be in your hand, put it far away” (Job 11:14) this refers to a loan deed of trust and a deed of sale for accommodation; [and it is said]: “And let not unrighteousness dwell in your tents” (ibid). This is a paid bill of debt.
He who says [that it applies to] a paid bill of debt, how much more [does it apply to] a loan deed of trust. But he, who says [that it applies to] a loan deed of trust, [would hold that it does not apply to] a paid bill of debt, because sometimes they keep it on account of the scribe’s fees.
It was stated: A scroll that has not been corrected: Ami said:
For thirty days one is allowed to hold on to it, from that point and onward, it is forbidden to hold on to it, because it is said: “Let not unrighteousness dwell in your tents.”
Nahman said:
Witnesses who said, “Our words were [regarding a matter of] trust” are not believed. [If they said], “Our words were [accompanied by a] declaration,” they are [also] not believed.
Mar the son of R. Ashi said:
[If witnesses said] “Our words were [regarding a matter of] trust,” they are not believed; [But if they said], “Our words were [accompanied by] a declaration,” they are believed.
What is the reason? 
This one was allowed to be written and that one was not allowed to be written.
Rava asked of R. Nahman:
[If witnesses say], “Our words were [accompanied by] a condition,” what is the law?
 “A declaration” and “trust” are not believed because they overturn [the validity] of the document, and this overturns [the validity] of the document?
Or perhaps
“condition” is a different situation?
He said to him:
When they come before us in court, we say to them:
go fulfill your conditions and then come to court.
If one witness says [that there was]
a condition, and one witness says
[that there was] no condition: R. Papa said:
They both testify to a valid document and only one says [that there was] a condition, and the words of one [witness] have no value where there are two witnesses.
Huna the son of R. Joshua objected:
If so, even if they both say [that there was a condition] [their words should] also [have no value]!
Rather we say [that]
they have come to uproot their testimony, and this one also comes to uproot his testimony.
And the law is according to R. Huna the son of R. Joshua.
Our rabbis taught:
If two [witnesses] were signed on a document and died, and two [other witnesses] came from the street and said,
“We know that it is their handwriting, but they were forced, they were minors, or they were disqualified witnesses,” they are believed.
But if there are other witnesses that this is their handwriting or their handwriting comes out from another place, from a document which was challenged and then confirmed in a court of law, they are not believed.
And we collect with it as with a valid document? 
Why?
They are two and two!
Sheshet:
This teaches [that] contradiction is the beginning of rebuttal, 

Daf 20a

and just as witnesses can be rebutted only in their presence, so too they can be contradicted only in their presence.
Nahman said to him:
If they had been before us and [the other two witnesses] had contradicted them, it  would have been a contradiction,  and we would not have paid any attention to them, because it  is a contradicted testimony.
Now that they are not here, and perhaps if they had been before us, they might [even] have admitted to them, why should they be believed?
Rather R. Nahman said;
set the two [witnesses] against the two [witnesses] and leave the property in the possession of its master.
This is like the case of the property of a certain lunatic.
A certain lunatic sold property.
Two came and said that
he sold [the property] when he was insane, and two came and said that
he sold [the property] when he was sane.
R. Ashi said:
Set the two [witnesses] against the two [witnesses] and leave the property in the possession of the lunatic.
And we say this only when he has the presumption of ownership from his ancestors, but if he does not have the presumption of ownership of his ancestors, we say that
he bought [the property] when he was insane and that he sold [it] when he was insane. 
Abbahu said:
They rebut witnesses only in their presence, but they contradict them also in not in their presence.
And a rebuttal in their absence — granted that it does not count as rebuttal, but it does count as contradiction.
The Master said [above]:
If there are witnesses that this is their handwriting, or their handwriting came out from another place, [namely] from a document which was contested and was confirmed in court, they are not believed.”
If it was contested, but not if it was not contested.  This is a support for R. Assi, for R. Assi said: 
They uphold a document only from a document which was contested and was confirmed in court.
The Nehardeans say:
A document is confirmed only from two ketubot or from two fields, and [only] when their owners used them for three years, and in comfort.
Shimi b. Ashi said:
And only when it is produced by another person, but not [if it is produced] by himself.
What is the difference if he himself produces it? Because he may have forged [the signatures of the witnesses]. [If so] even when produced by another person also, perhaps he went and saw [the signatures] and forged [them]?
All of this, it is too difficult to direct [his handwriting].
Our Rabbis taught:
A person may write [down] his testimony in a document and may through it give evidence even after some years.
Huna said:
Only when he remembers it by himself.Only when he remembers it by himself.
Yohanan said: 
Even if he does not remember it by himself.
Rabbah said:
Learn from [the words of] R. Yohanan [the following]:
These two people who know evidence and one of them has forgotten it, the other one may remind him of it.
They asked:
In the case of the litigant himself what is the law? 
Haviva said:
Even he himself may do so.
Mar b. R. Ashi said: 
He himself may not.
And the law is:
He himself may not.

Daf 20b

But if he is a scholar even he himself may remind the witness. 
As that case of R. Ashi who knew evidence for R. Kahana,
and he (R. Kahana) said to him (R. Ashi):
Does the master remember that evidence? 
And he said to him:
No. 
But was it not so and so?
He replied:
I do not know.
In the end, R. Ashi remember, and he testified for him. 
He saw that R. Kahana was surprised,
so he said to him:
Do you think that I relied upon you? I took it on myself and I remembered it.
We taught elsewhere: 
Those mounds which are near, whether to a town or a road, both new and old, are unclean. Those which are distant: If they are new, they are clean,
 and if they are old, they are unclean.  
What is near?
Fifty cubits. And what is old?
Sixty years,
the words of R. Meir.
Judah says:
“Near”—when there is none nearer; “old,” when no one remembers it.
What is a town and what is a road?
If I say: A town actually means a town, and a road is actually a road, do we presume uncleanness out of doubt?
Did not Resh Lakish say:
They found some pretext and purified the land of Israel?
Zera:
A town—this is a town which is near a burial place, 
and a road—this is a road [leading] to a burial place.
This makes sense [in the case of] a road [leading] to a burial place, because sometimes it might happen [that a funeral took place] at twilight, and that they buried it in the mound.
But [in the case of] a town which is near a burial place, all go to the burial place!   
Hanina said:
Because women bring there their abortions and lepers their arms. [And it is assumed that] to a distance of fifty cubits she goes alone, but for a longer distance she takes a man with her and [then] she goes to the burial place.
Therefore, we do not presume uncleanness in Eretz Israel.
Hisda said:
Learn from [the words of] R. Meir:
This testimony, for sixty years one will remember it, for longer one does not remember.
But this is not so:
There [he does not remember the evidence after sixty years] because it is not his concern, but here, since it has been given to him [as a responsibility], even for a longer [period he] also [remembers the evidence].
1) [If] one witness says,
“This is my handwriting and that is the handwriting of my fellow”, and the other [witness] says,
“This is my handwriting and that is the handwriting of my fellow”, they are believed.
2) [If] one says,
“This is my handwriting” and the other says,
“This is my handwriting” they must join to themselves another [person], the words of Rabbi [Judah Hanasi].
But the Sages say:
They need not join to themselves another [person], rather a person is believed to say,
“this is my handwriting.
When you think about it, according to Rabbi [Judah Hanasi]  

Daf 21a

they give evidence with regard to their handwriting, according to the Sages they give evidence with regard to the maneh in the deed.
This is obvious!
You might have said 
that Rebbe was in doubt whether they testified to their signature or to the maneh in the deed.
And the ramification would be
when one of them died. [Here] we would need two witnesses from the street to testify regarding it, because otherwise the [whole of the money] less a quarter would go out by the mouth of one witness, 
and both here and there the stricter rule would prevail.
Therefore, he teaches that it is clear to Rebbe, whether the result is lenient or strict.
For Rav Judah said that Rav said:
If two [witnesses] are signed on a document and one of them died, two from the street must give evidence with regard to him. In this case Rebbe would be lenient and the Rabbis would be strict.
And if there are not two, but there is only one, what [then]?
Abaye said:
He [the second witness] writes his signature on a piece of clay and places it before the court, and the court confirms it, and he need not testify to his own signature, and he goes with that one and they testify to [the signature of] the other [witness].
And specifically only on a piece of clay but not a scroll, lest a person of bad character find it and write on it whatever he likes, and we have learned: 
If one person produces the handwriting   of another person that he owes him [money], he collects [the debt] from unencumbered property.
Rav Judah said [that] Shmuel said.
The halakhah is according to the sages  
This is obvious! A singular sage and the many–the halakhah follows the many.
What might you have thought:
Since the halakhah follows Rebbe as against one of his fellow-scholars, it is also against many of his fellow-scholars, that is why he teaches us.
(Mnemonic: Nah, Nad, Had)
R. Hinena b. Hiyya said to R. Judah, and some say R. Huna b. Judah said to Rav Judah, and some say R. Hiyya b. Judah said to Rav Judah:
Did Shmuel really say this?
Surely there once was a document that came out of the court of Mar Shmuel and there was written in it: 
When R. Anan b. Hiyya came and testified to his own signature and to that of his fellow-witness, namely, R. Hanan b. Rabbah, and when R. Hanan b. Rabbah came and testified to his own signature and to that of his fellow-witness, namely R. Anan b. Hiyya, we verified it, and we have confirmed it, as it is proper!
He said to him:
That deed belonged to orphans, and Shmuel was concerned of an errant court,
and Shmuel thought:
Lest there be someone who held that the halakhah is [generally] according to Rebbe against one fellow-scholar, and not against many of his fellow-scholars but [that] in this [the halakhah is according to Rebbe] even against many of his fellow-scholars,
I will leave some room, so that the orphans should not suffer any loss.
Rav Judah said that Shmuel said:
A witness and judge can be joined together [to create one set of witnesses].
Rami b. Hama said: 
How excellent is this tradition!
Rava said:
What is the excellence?
What the witness testifies to the judge does not testify to, and what the judge testifies to the witness does not testify to?.
Rather, when Rami b. Ezekiel came he said:
Do not listen to those rules which my brother Judah laid down in the name of Shmuel.

Daf 21b

Rabbanai, the brother of R. Hiyya b. Abba, came to buy sesame and he said:
Thus Shmuel said:
Witness and judge are joined together.
Amemar said:
How excellent is this tradition!
Ashi said to Amemar: 
Because the father of your mother praised it, you also praise it!
Rava has already refuted it.
Safra said that R. Abba said that R. Isaac b. Shmuel b. Martha said that R. Huna said, and some say that R. Huna said that Rav said: 
Three that sat together to uphold a document, and two of them know the signatures of the witnesses and one does not know, before they sign, they may testify before him, and he  then signs  with them; after they have signed, they may not testify before him and he may not sign.  
But do we write the attestation [to such a document]? 
Did not R. Papi say in the name of Rava:
The judge’s attestation which is written before the witnesses give evidence as to their signatures is invalid, because it looks like a lie? 
And here also it looks like a lie!
Rather say:
Before they have written the attestation they may testify before him and he then signs with them; after they have written the attestation, they may not testify before him and he may not sign.
Learn from this three things:
Learn from this that
a witness may be  a judge;
Learn from this that
if the judges know the signatures of the witnesses, here is no need to testify before them;
and learn from this that 
if the judges do not know the signatures of the witnesses, it is necessary to testify before every one
Ashi raised a difficulty on this:
It makes sense that we learn from this that a witness may be a judge, 
but [how can we learn that] if the judges know the signatures of the witnesses, there is no need to testify before them? Perhaps I could say to you
that this is [generally] necessary, but it is different here, because the telling has been fulfilled before one.
And [how can we learn that] if the judges do not know the signatures of the witnesses, it is necessary to give evidence before every one?  Perhaps I could say to you
that this is not necessary, but it is different here, because the telling would not have been fulfilled at all.
Abba sat and said this tradition, that a witness may be a judge.
Safra objected to R. Abba:
If three saw it and they are the court, two shall stand up and seat two of their colleagues beside the one, and they shall testify before them, and [then] they say: Sanctified is the new moon, sanctified; for one person is not believed by himself.
Now, if you should think that a witness may be a judge, why go through all this?
Let them sit in their places and sanctify [the new moon]!
He said to him:
That was also difficult to me, and I asked R. Yitzchak b. Shmuel b. Martha. and R. Yitzchak [asked] R. Huna, and R. Huna [asked] Hiyya b. Rav, and Hiyya b. Rav [asked] Rav, and he said to them:
Leave alone the testimony as to the new moon, [for it is] biblical, and the upholding of documents is rabbinic.
Abba said [that] R. Huna said [that] Rav said:
If three sit to uphold a document and an objection was raised against one of them: If before they have signed [the attestation], they may give evidence regarding him, and he may [then] sign; after they have signed, they may not give evidence regarding him and he may not sign.
What was the nature of the protest?
If the protest was on the grounds of robbery, 

Daf 22a

they are two and two. [And] if it is a protest regarding family blemish, then it just a matter of revealing the truth.
In any case, I can tell you,
it is a protest regarding robbery, and these say:
We know of him that he has repented.
Zera said:
This matter I have heard from R. Abba, and if not for R. Abba of Acco, I would have forgotten it:
If three sit to confirm a document and one of them dies, they must write,
“We were in a session of three, and one is no more.”
Nahman b. Yitzchak said:
And if it is written in it: This document has been produced before us [as] a court of law, they need not do anymore
But perhaps it was an arrogant court, and it follows Shmuel,
for Shmuel said:
If two have judged, their judgment is a judgment, only they are called an arrogant court?
When it is written in it,
“The court of our Master Ashi.”  
But perhaps the scholars of the school of R. Ashi hold like Shmuel?
When it is written in it,
“And our Master Ashi told us.”
If a woman says,
“I was married and I am divorced”, she is believed, for the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permitted.
But if there are witnesses that she was married, and she says,
“I am divorced”, she is not believed.
If she says,
“I was taken captive but I have remained clean”, she is believed, for the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permitted.
But if there are witnesses that she was taken captive and she says,
“I have remained clean” she is not believed.
But if the witnesses came after she had married, she shall not go out.
Assi said:
From where in the Torah is [the principle of] “the mouth that forbade is the mouth that permits”?
Because it is said: “My daughter I gave to this man as a wife” (Deuteronomy 22:16): “To a man” he made her forbidden, “This,” he made her permitted.
Why do I need a verse?
It is logic—
he made her forbidden, and he made her permitted!
Rather, the verse is required according to what R. Huna said in the name of Rav,
or R. Huna said in the name of Rav: 
From where do we know from the Bible that the father is believed to make his daughter forbidden? Because it is said: “My daughter I gave to [this] man as his wife.”
Why do I need the word “this”? It is required for what R. Jonah taught, for R. Jonah taught:
“My daughter I gave to this man”: “To this”, and not to the brother-in-law.
Our Rabbis taught:
If a woman says,
“I am married,”and then she says,
“I am unmarried,” she is believed.
But she made herself forbidden!
Rava the son of R. Huna said:
When she has given a plausible reason for her words.
It was also taught in a baraita:
If she says,
I am married’, and then she says,
‘I am unmarried’, she is not believed, but if she gives a plausible reason for her words, she is believed. And so it once happened with a great woman, who was great in beauty, and men were eager   to betroth her, and she said to them,
“I am betrothed.”
After some time she betrothed herself. 
The Sages said to her:
Why did you do this?
She answered them,
“At first, when unworthy men came to me, I said, “I am betrothed”; now that worthy men come to me, I betrothed myself.”
And this law R. Aha, the officer of the castle, brought before the Sages in Usha, and they said:
If she gives a plausible reason for her words she is believed.
Shmuel asked Rav: 
If [a woman] says,
“I am unclean,”and then she says,
“I am clean,” what is [the law]?  
He answered him: 
Also in this case if she gives a plausible reason for her words she is believed.

Daf 22b

Also in this case if she gives a plausible reason for her words she is believed.
He learned it from him forty times, and still Shmuel did not act accordingly with regard to himself.
Our Rabbis taught:
Two [witnesses] say [that the husband of the woman]
has died, and two [witnesses] say [that]
he has not died, or two [witnesses] say
[that] she has been divorced, and two [witnesses] say [that]
she has not been divorced, she shall not marry [again],ut if she has married [again], she need not go out.
R. Menahem b. Yose says:
She must go out.
Menahem b. Yose said:
When do I say [that] she must go out [of the second marriage]? — When witnesses came and then she married, but if she married and then witnesses came, she need not go out.
Now, they are two and two, [and] he who has intercourse with her should be liable to bring a doubtful guilt-offering! 
Sheshet said:
For instance, when she was married to one of her witnesses.
She herself should bring a doubtful guilt offering!
When she says,
“I am sure.”
Yohanan said:
Two [witnesses] say [that the husband]
has died, and two [witnesses] say 
he has not died, she shall not remarry, but if she has remarried, she need not go out [of the second marriage].
two [witnesses] say [that] 
she has been divorced, and two [witnesses] say [that] 
she has not been divorced, she shall not remarry and if she has married, she must go out.
What is the difference between the first case and the second case?
Abaye said
Interpret it [that it speaks] of one witness.
One witness says [that]
he has died, the rabbis believe him as two [witnesses], and [this is] according to Ulla,
for Ulla said:
Wherever the Torah believes one witness, [it is as if] there are two, 
whereas he who said that he has not died is one, and the words of one have no strength against the [words of] two.
If so, [she should be allowed to marry again] ab initio!
Because of R. Assi,
for R. Assi said
“Turn away from yourself a twisted mouth, and keep away from perverse lips” (Proverbs 4:24).
In the second case [however] one witness says [that] she has been divorced, and one witness says [that] she has not been divorced, they [therefore] both testify that she was a married woman, and he who says [that] she has been divorced is one, and the words of one have no validity against two.
Rava said:
Indeed, they are two and two, and R. Yohanan agreed with the words of R. Menahem b. Yose in [the case of] divorce, but not in [the case of] death.
Why?
In the case of death, she cannot contradict him, [but] in the case of divorce, she can contradict him.
But would she really have so much chutzpah?  
Did not R. Hamnuna say: 
f a woman says to her husband, “You have divorced me,” she is believed, for it is a presumption [that] a woman would not be so bold before her husband?
This is the case only when there are no witnesses who support her; but when there are witnesses who support her, she is indeed bold.
Assi says:
This is a case where the witnesses say,
He has died now,” [or] “He has divorced her now.”
Death one cannot prove, divorce one can prove, 
for we say to her,
If it is so, show us your get.”
Our rabbis taught: 
Two [witnesses] say that
he has been betrothed, and two [witnesses] say [that] 
she has not been betrothed, she may not marry, and if she has married, she need not go out.
Two [witnesses] say [that] 
she has been divorced, and two [witnesses] say [that] 
she has not been divorced, she may not marry, and if she has married, she must go out.

Daf 23a

What is the difference between the first case and the second case?
Abaye said: 
Interpret it [as referring] to one witness. 
One witness says [that] she has been betrothed and one witness says [that] she has not been betrothed, they both testify to an unmarried woman, and he who says [that] she has been betrothed is one, and the words of one have no validity against two.
In the second case, one witness says [that] she has been divorced and one witness says [that] she has not been divorced, they both testify to a married woman, and he who says that she has been divorced is one, and the words of one have no validity against two.
Ashi said:
Indeed, they are two and two, and reverse it. Two say, “We have seen that she has been betrothed,” and two say, “We have not seen that she has been betrothed,” she shall not marry [another man], and if she has married she must go out.
[But] this is obvious!
“We have not seen” is no evidence!
It is necessary for the case when they dwelt in one courtyard;
one might say,
“If she had been betrothed it would have been known,”
therefore it teaches us there are people who get betrothed in private.
In the second case, when two say, “We have seen that she has been divorced,” and two say, “We have not seen that she has been divorced,” she shall not marry again, and if she has married she need not go out.”
What does it teach us?  Although they live in the same courtyard!
[But then] this teaches the same thing as the first case!
What might you have said?
That with regard to betrothal it happens that people get betrothed quietly, but with regard to divorce, if she had been divorced, it would have been known, so it teaches us that there are people who get betrothed and get divorced in private.
And if witnesses come after she got married she need not go out [of the marriage].
Oshaia teaches it in reference to the first clause. Rabbah b. Avin teaches it in reference to the second clause.
He who teaches it in reference to the first clause, how much more [does he refer it] to the second clause, for in the case of a captive woman they ruled leniently.  
But he who teaches it in reference to the second clause does not refer it to the first clause.
Shall we say that they disagree concerning the view of R. Hamnuna: that he who teaches it in reference to the first clause holds the view of R. Hamnuna, and he who teaches it in reference [only] to the second clause does not hold the View of R. Hamnuna?
No, they all hold the view of R. Hamnuna
and here they differ in this.
One reasons:
when R. Hamnuna’s statement was made, it referred to a case [where she said so] in his presence, but in his absence she is bold [enough to lie], and one reasons [that]
even in his absence she is not bold.
And if witnesses came after she got married etc.
Avuha DeShmuel said:
“She got married,” does not mean she actually got married. Rather as soon as they allowed her to get married even if she did not get married yet.
But it says: “She shall not go out”! 
[This means] she shall not go out from her first permission.
Our rabbis taught: 
If she says, “I was taken captive and I am pure, and I have witnesses that I am pure”
they do not say
“Let’s wait until the witnesses come,” Rather they allow her at once [to marry].
If they allowed her to marry and then the witnesses came and said, “We do not know,” then she need not go out [of the marriage].
But if witnesses of defilement came, even if she has many children she must go out.
Certain women captives once came to Nehardea.
Avuha DeShmuel placed watchmen over them. 
Shmuel said to him:
And who watched them till now? 
He said back to him:
If they had been you daughters would you have treated them so cheaply?
It was, “As an error which proceeds from before the ruler” (Ecclesiastes 10:5) and the daughters of Mar Samuel were taken captive. And they were brought to the Land of Israel.
They had their captors stand outside and they went in into the school of R. Hanina.
This one said,
“I was taken captive and I am pure,” and that one said.
“I was taken captive and I am pure,” 
and they allowed them [to marry a priest].
In the end the captors entered.
R. Hanina said:
They are the children of a teacher [of Torah].
It [then] became known that they were the daughters of Mar Shmuel.
R. Hanina said to R. Shaman b. Abba: 
Go and take care of your relatives.
He said to R. Hanina:
But there are witnesses in the country beyond the sea!
Now, however they are not before us. Witnesses are in the north, and [therefore] she shall be forbidden [to marry]?
[Now] the reason is because no witnesses came, but if witnesses came she is forbidden!
But did not Avuha DeShmuel say: 
As soon as they allowed her to get married, even if she did not get married?  
Ashi said: 
Witnesses of defilement were referred to here.

Daf 23b

Two women were taken captive: one says, 
“I was taken captive and I am pure”, and the other one says, 
“I was taken captive and I am pure”– they are not believed.
But when they testify regarding one another, they are believed. 
GEMARA. Our Rabbis taught:
[If she says], “I am impure and my friend is pure,” she is believed; “I am pure and my friend is impure,” she is not believed; “I and my friend are impure,” she is believed as to herself and she is not believed as to her friend; 
“I and my friend are pure,” she is believed as to her friend and she is not believed as to herself.
The Master said:
“[If she says] “I am pure and my friend is impure” she is not believed.
What was the actual case?
If there are no witnesses, why is she not believed as to herself? She says,
“I was taken captive and I am pure!”
Hence it is obvious that there are witnesses. 
[Now] say the middle clause:
“I and my friend are impure”; she is believed as to herself and she is not believed as to her friend.”
But if there are witnesses, why is she not believed? 
Hence it is obvious that there are no witnesses.
[Now] read the last clause:
I and my friend are pure,” she is believed as to her friend and she is not believed as to herself.”
But if there are no witnesses, why is she not believed as to herself?
Rather it is obvious that there are witnesses.
The first clause and the last clause refer to a case when there are witnesses, [and] the middle clause when there are no witnesses?
Abaye said: 
Yes, the first clause and the last clause refer to a case when there are witnesses, [and] the middle clause when there are no witnesses?
Papa said:
All of it refers to where there are witnesses, but there is one witness who states the opposite.
[If] she says, “I am impure and my friend is pure,” and the one witness says to her, “You are pure and your friend is impure,”
she has declared herself forbidden, [and] her friend becomes permitted through her testimony.
If [she says], “I am pure and my friend is impure,” and the one witness says to her, 
“You are impure and your friend is pure’, since there are witnesses, she is not believed [as to herself], [and] her friend becomes permitted through the testimony of the [one] witness.
[If she says], “I and my friend are impure” and the one witness says to her, “You and your friend are pure,” she has declared herself forbidden, [and] her friend becomes permitted through the testimony of the [one] witness.
Why do I need this again? 
It is the same 
as the first clause!
You might have said [that] they are both pure and the reason she says so is “Let me die with the Philistines,” so he teaches us [that this is not s
[If she says] “I and my friend are pure,” and the one witness says to her, “You and your friend are impure,” since there are witnesses, she is not believed, [and] her friend becomes permitted through her testimony.  
What need is there again for this? 
It is the same as in the very first clause! 
What might you have said?
She is believed only when she declares herself unfit, but when she declares herself fit I might say that she is not believed, so he teaches us [that this is not so].
And likewise two men, [if] one says, “I am a priest”, and the other says, “I am a priest”, they are not believed. But when they testify about one another, they are believed.
Rabbi Judah says: 
one does not raise [a person] to the priesthood through the testimony of one witness.
Rabbi Elazar says:
When is this true? When there are people who object;
but when there are no people who object, one raises [a person] to the priesthood through the testimony of one witness.
Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says in the name of Rabbi Shimon the son of the assistant chief of priests:
one raises [a person] to the priesthood through the testimony of one witness.
GEMARA. Why do I need all of these [cases]?
They are needed.
For if he had stated [only the case of] “R. Joshua admits”: [I might have said that only in that case is that principle invoked] because there is a possible loss of money but [in the case of] witnesses where there is no possible loss of money, I would not say so.
And if he had stated [the case of] witnesses, for [their statement concerns] other people but where it concerns himself I would not say so.

Daf 24a

I would not say so.
And if he would let us hear these two [cases I might have said] because [both cases deal with] money matters but [in the case of] “a married woman” which is a matter of [sexual] prohibition I would say no.
Why do I need [the case of] “I was taken captive and I am pure”?  
Because he wants to teach, “But if witnesses came after she got married, she shall not go out.”
This goes well according to him who teaches this in reference to the second clause, but according to him who teaches it in reference to the first clause, what is there to say?
Because he wants to teach [the case of], “If two women were taken captive.”
And why do I need [the case of] “If two women were taken captive”?
What might you have said?
Let us be concerned lest they collude, therefore he teaches us [that we are not concerned].
And also why do I need the case of “and also two men”? 
Because he wants to teach the dispute between R. Judah and the rabbis.
Our rabbis taught:
[One who says:] I am a priest and my friend is a priest, he is believed in order that others may allow him to eat terumah, but he is not believed that he would be allowed to marry a woman until there are three, [and] two testify to one and two testify to the other.
R. Judah says:
He is not believed even with regard to allowing him to eat terumah until there are three, [and] two testify to one and two testify to the other.
That is to say that R. Judah is concerned about collusion,  and the rabbis are not concerned about collusion?
But we have heard the opposite, as it is taught: 
Donkey-drivers who come to a town and one of them says,
“Mine is new and my friend’s is old” [or] “Mine has not had tithes removed and my friends has tithes removed”; he is not believed. R. Judah says: He is believed!
Ada b. Ahava, in the name of Rav: 
The statement must be reversed.
Abaye said: 
Indeed, do not reverse it; 
they were lenient with regard to demai, for most ammei haaretz separate tithes.
Rava said: 
Is the question [only] of R. Judah against R. Judah? Are the rabbis against the rabbis not a difficulty? 
Rather, R. Judah against R. Judah is not a difficulty 
as we have [just] explained, [and] the rabbis against the rabbis is not a difficulty for it is as R. Hama b. Ukba said that [it speaks of]
when he has his trade-tools in his hand;  

Daf 24b

so too here it refers to a case when he  has his trade-tools in his hand
And in what context was that of R. Hama. b. Ukba said? 
On this which we have learned: If a potter left his pots  and went down to drink [water from the river,]  the inner ones are pure and the outer ones are impure. 
But it has been taught
that these and those are impure?
Hama b. Ukba said:
[It refers to a case] when he had his trade-tools in his hand, so that everyone’s hand touches them.
But [then] the case that we have learned, “The inner ones are pure and the outer ones are impure,” where would it be found? 
These and those are pure?
Hama b. Ukba said: 
When his trade-tools are not in his hand.
But [then] the case that we have learned, 
“The inner ones are pure and the outer ones are impure,”  
where would it be found?
When they are near the public road and [they are impure] because of border stones of the public road.
When they are near the public road and [they are impure] because of border stones of the public road.
R. Judah and the rabbis differ as to whether one raises [a person] from terumah to the status of a kohen.
It was asked of them:
Does one raise [a person] from documents to [the full status of a priest] with regard to lineage? 
What is this case?
If we say that it is written in it: “I, So-and-so, a priest have signed as witness,” who has testified about him?
Rather, it is necessary when it is written in it: “I, So-and-so, a priest, have borrowed a maneh from so-and-so,” and witnesses have signed [the document]. What [then] is [the law]? 
Do they testify [only] to the maneh [mentioned] in the document, or do they testify to the whole matter? 
Huna and R. Hisda
One says:
They raise [him] and one says:
They do not raise [him].
It was asked of them: 
Do they raise [a person] from the lifting up of the hands to the status of a priest with regard to lineage?
Ask this according to him who says [that] they raise [a person] from terumah to the status of a priest and ask it according to him who says [that] they do not raise [a person from terumah to the status of a priest].  
Ask it according to him who says [that] they raise: 
This is said in the case of terumah, which [if eaten by one who is not a kohen] is punishable with death; 
but [in the case of] “lifting up the hands,” which is only the prohibition of a positive commandment, [I would say] no.  Or perhaps there is no difference.
And ask it according to him who says [that] they do not raise [from eating terumah to being a priest]:
This is in the case of terumah, which is eaten in privacy; but “lifting up the hands,” which [is done] in public [I might say that] if he were not a priest he would not have the chutzpah [to do so]. Or perhaps there is no difference?
Hisda and Rabbi Avina: 
One says they raise,
and one says
they do not raise.
Nahman b. Yitzhak said to Rava:
Do they raise [a person] from “lifting up the hands” to the full status of a priest for matters of lineage?
He said to him:
This is a dispute between R. Hisda and R. Avina.
What is the halakhah?
He said to him:
I know a baraita: 
For it has been taught:R. Yose said:
Great is presumption, for it is said: “And of the children of the priests: the children of Havayah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name. 
These sought their register of those that were reckoned by genealogy, and they were not found, therefore were they deemed polluted and sent away from the priesthood.
And the Tirshatha said to them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Tummim” (Ezra 2:61-63).  
He said to them:
You remain in your presumptive state; what have you eaten in exile? The holy things eaten outside of Jerusalem. So too here also [you may eat] the holy things eaten outside of Jerusalem.
Now if we were to assume [that] one raises [a person] from “lifting up the hands” to the state of full priesthood, since these spread out their hands, they might come to raise them?
It is different here, for their presumption has been damaged. 
For if you do not say so [then] according to him who says [that] they raise [a person] from terumah to being a priest, since they eat terumah they might come raise them!
Rather it is because their presumption has been damaged.

Daf 25a

If so, what is so great about presumption?
Until now they ate [only] rabbinical terumah [and] now they ate toraitic terumah.
And if you wish you may say:
Now also they ate [only] rabbinic terumah [and] did not eat toraitic terumah,
and when they raise [a person] from terumah to the status of a priest, it is only in the case of toraitic terumah, but in the case of rabbinic terumah they do not raise.
If so, what [is the meaning of the words] “Great is presumption?”
Although one might have forbidden them [from eating rabbinic terumah] because of toraitic terumah, they did not forbid them.
But did they not eat toraitic terumah?
Surely it is written: “That they should not eat of the most holy things” (Ezra 2:63) of “the most holy things” they did not eat, but toraitic terumah they did eat!
Rather this is what he says:
They did not [eat] anything that is called a “holy thing” as it is written: “And no stranger shall eat of the holy thing” (Leviticus 22:10), nor anything which is called “holy thing” for it is written: “And if a priest’s daughter be married to a stranger she shall not eat of that which is separated from the holy things” (Leviticus 22:12) and 
a Master said:
That which has been set aside from the holy things she shall not eat.
Come and hear:
A presumption for the priesthood: The “lifting up of the hands” in Babylonia, and the eating of the hallah in Syria, and taking a share in [the priestly] gifts in large cities.
In any case he teaches the “lifting up of the hands,” is it not with regard to the full status of the priest? 
No, with regard to terumah.
But he teaches it as similar to the eating of hallah, just as the eating of hallah [is sufficient to prove that he has] the full status of a priest, so does the lifting up of the hands [prove that he has] the full status of a priest?
No the eating of the hallah itself merely [serves as evidence] regarding terumah,
[for] he holds that
hallah in our days is of rabbinical status and terumah is Biblical and one raises [a person] from rabbinic hallah to Biblical terumah
and [it is] as R. Huna the son of R. Joshua reversed [the words of] the rabbis.
Come and hear:
[The following constitutes a] presumption for the priesthood: the lifting up of the hands and [taking a share] at the distribution at the threshing floors in the Land of Israel;  in Syria and in all places to which the messengers of the New Moon come the lifting up of the hands is evidence, but not [taking a share] at the distribution at the threshing floors.
Babylonia is like Syria. R. Shimon b. Gamaliel says: 
Also Alexandria in Egypt in earlier times because there was there a permanent court of law. 
In any case he teaches the lifting up of the hands. Is this not with regard to the full status of the priest?
No, with regard to hallah. 
But he teaches [the rule regarding the lifting up of the hands] as similar to taking a share at the threshing floors: just as taking a share at the threshing floors [serves as evidence] in respect of the full status of a priest, so does the lifting up of the hands [serve as evidence] in respect of the full status of a priest!
No, taking a share at the threshing floor itself [serves as evidence only as] to hallah, 
for he holds that 
terumah in our days is rabbinical and hallah is biblical and one raises [a person] from rabbinical terumah to biblical hallah.
As the rabbis found by R. Huna the son of R. Joshua. 
For R. Huna the son of R. Joshua said:
 I found the rabbis in the Bet Rav sitting and saying: 
Even according to him who says that terumah in these days is rabbinical, hallah is biblical, for during the seven [years] that they conquered [the Land] and during the seven [years] that they distributed [it] they were obligated in hallah and not obligated in terumah.
Even according to him who says that terumah in these days is rabbinical, hallah is biblical, for during the seven [years] that they conquered [the Land] and during the seven [years] that they distributed [it] they were obligated in hallah and not obligated in terumah.
On the contrary, even according to him who says [that] terumah in these days is biblical, hallah is rabbinical,
for it has been taught: [It is written:] “In your coming into the land:” If “in your coming” you might think as soon as two or three spies had entered it? [Therefore] it is said “in your coming” (Numbers 15:18). I have spoken of the coming of all of you and not of the coming of a portion of you.
Now when Ezra brought them up

Daf 25b

not all of them went up.
Come and hear:
A presumption for the priesthood [is constituted by] the “lifting up of the hands” and taking a share at the threshing floors and testimony. 
Now is testimony a presumption? 
Rather this is what he means:
 The “lifting up of the hands is like a testimony:” Just as testimony [raises one] to the status of a priest, so too the “lifting up of the hands’ [raises one] to the status of a priest!
No. Testimony that comes on the strength of a presumption is like a presumption.
Like that man who came before R. Ammi [and] said to him: 
I am convinced that he is a priest. 
He said to him: 
What have you seen? 
And he answered him: 
He read first in the synagogue.
 [He responded] As a priest or as a great man?
After him a Levite read.
And R. Ammi raised him to the priesthood on the strength of his testimony.
Someone came before R. Joshua b. Levi, [and] said to him:
I am convinced that he is a Levite.
He said to him:
 What have you seen?
He answered him:
He read second in the Synagogue. 
As a Levite or as a prominent man?
A priest read before him. 
And R. Joshua b. Levi raised him to the status of Levite on the strength of his testimony.
Someone once came before Resh Lakish [and] said to him: 
I am convinced that he is a priest. 
He said to him:
What have you seen? 
[He answered him:]
 He asked him:
He read first in the Synagogue. 
Have you seen him take a share at the threshing floors?
 R. Elazar said to him: 
And if there is no threshing floor, is the priesthood annulled?
Once they were sitting before R. Yohanan [and] there came such a case before them.
Resh Lakish asked him:
Have you seen him take a share at the threshing floor? 
R. Yohanan said to him: 
And if there is no threshing floor, is the priesthood annulled?
He turned round and looked at R. Elazar with displeasure. He said:
You have heard something from the smith’s son and you did not say it to us in his name.
Rabbi and R. Hiyya: one raised a son to the priesthood on the testimony of his father, and one raised a brother to the state of Levite on the testimony of his brother.
Conclude that it was Rabbi who raised the son to the priesthood on the testimony of his father, for it has been taught:
If one comes and says: “This is my son and he is a priest,” he is believed with regard to allowing him to eat terumah, but he is not believed with regard to allowing him to marry a woman, the words of Rabbi.
R. Hiyya said to him:
If you believe him to allow him to eat terumah, believe him to allow him to marry a woman, and if you do not believe him so as to allow him to marry a woman, do not believe him also as to allow him to eat terumah. 
He answered him:
I believed him to allow him to eat terumah because it is in his hands to let him eat terumah, but I do not believe him so as to allow him to marry a woman because it is not in his hands to let him marry a woman. 
 Conclude [that this opinion belongs to Rabbi].
And since it was Rabbi who raised the son to the priesthood on the testimony of his father, [it must have been] R. Hiyya who raised the brother to the status of Levite on the testimony of his brother.
But [according to] R. Hiyya, why is the son different that [he is] not [raised]? Because he is related to his father. A brother too is related to his brother! 

Daf 26a

When he was innocently talking. 
As that which Rav Judah said in the name of Shmuel:
 It happened that a man was talking innocently and said: 
“I remember when I was a child and riding on my father’s shoulder, they took me out from school and stripped me of my shirt and immersed me  so that I could eat terumah in the evening.”
And R. Hiyya added: 
And my friends kept away from me 
and called me ‘Yohanan the hallot-eater.” And Rabbi raised him to the priesthood on his testimony.
It was taught R. Shimon b. Elazar says:
Just as terumah is a presumption for the priesthood, so is the first tithe a presumption for the priesthood, but he who takes a share through the court, [this] is not a presumption.
The first tithe belongs to the Levite?!
[This] follows R. Elazar ben Azariah,
for it has been taught:
Terumah belongs to the priest, the first tithe to the Levite, the words of R. Akiva.
Elazar ben Azariah says: 
The first tithe belongs also to the priest.
Say that R. Elazar ben Azariah says: “Also to the priest” does he say: to the priest and not to the Levite?
Yes. after Ezra had punished them.
But perhaps it happened that they gave it to him?
Hisda said: 
What are we dealing with here? A case where we know that his father was a priest and a rumor came out concerning him that he was the son of a divorced woman or a halutzah and [yet] they gave him tithe at the threshing floor.
[He could not be regarded as] a Levite, because he was not a Levite. What then could you say? That he was the son of a divorced woman or the son of a halutzah? Even so there is no question, for according to the one who says [that] the first tithe is forbidden to strangers they would not have given [it] to him. And even according to the one who says that the first tithe is permitted to strangers, this refers only to give to them but as part of the distribution, they would not give it to him.
But he who takes a share through the court, [this] is not a presumption.
If through the court it is not a presumption, what is presumption?
Sheshet said: This is what he means: 
One who shares with his brother’s at the court terumah that was part of his father’s property, it is not a presumption.
This is obvious!
What might you have said?
Since these [get their share of terumah] in order to eat it, so too this one also [gets his share of terumah] in order to eat it. So he teaches us [that]
those [get the terumah] for eating and this one for selling. 
Judah says: 
One does not raise [a person] to the priesthood on the testimony of one witness, etc… [ Rabbi Shimon ben Gamaliel says in the name of Rabbi Shimon the son of the assistant chief of priests: [a person] to the priesthood through the testimony of one witness.]
Shimon b. Gamaliel is the same as R. Eliezer?
 And if you will say [that]
they differ with regard to an objection raised by one person [in] that
R. Eliezer holds that an objection
[can be accepted from] one [person] and R. Shimon b. Gamaliel holds that
 an objection [must come from at least] two [people], 
did not R. Yohanan say:
All agree that an objection [must come from] at least two persons?
Rather here we are dealing with a case where we have a presumption that the father of this [person] is a priest and a rumor came out concerning him that he is the son of a divorced woman or the son of a halutzah and they demoted him from the priesthood, and one witness came and said,
“I know that he is a priest” and they raised him [again]

Daf 26b

and they raised him [again]
and [then] came two [other witnesses]
and said [that] he is the son of a divorced woman or the son of a halutzah and they demoted him [again]
and [then] one witness came and said,
“I know that he is a priest.
All agree that the [two witnesses] are joined into one testimony, but they differ as to whether we are afraid of disgracing the court.
The first Tanna holds: 
Since we demoted him we do not raise him, [again] because we are afraid of disgracing the court. 
And R. Shimon b. Gamaliel holds: 
We have demoted him and we can raise him and we are not concerned of bringing disgrace on the court.
Ashi asked against this: 
If so, even [when there are] two and two also?
Rather R. Ashi said 
they differ as to whether they are joined into one testimony. And they are arguing about the same issue as the following tannaim, 
for it has been taught:
Their testimonies are not joined together unless they have both seen [the event] at the same time. Joshua b. Korha says: 
Even when [they have seen] one after another.
And their testimonies cannot be upheld in court until they both testify at the same time Natan says: 
 We hear the evidence of one today and when the other one comes tomorrow we hear his evidence.
A woman was imprisoned by non-Jews: If for the sake of money, she is permitted to her husband, And if in order to take her life, she is forbidden to her husband..
GEMARA. R. Shmuel b. Yitzchak said in the name of Rav: 
They have taught [this] only when the hand of Israel is strong over the non-Jews but when the hand of the non-Jews is strong over themselves, even if for the sake of money, she is forbidden to her husband.
Rava objected:
R. Yose the priest and R. Zechariah b. HaKatzav testified regarding an Israelite woman, who had been taken as collateral in Ashkelon and her family distanced her and her witnesses testified that she had not been secluded [with a man] and that she was not defiled [by a man].
And the Sages said to them:
If you believe [the witnesses] that she had been taken as collateral, believe [them also] that she was not secluded and that she was not defiled, and if you do not believe [them] that she was not secluded and that she was not defiled, do not believe [them] that she was pledged.
Now Ashkelon [was a town in which] the hand of the non-Jews was strong over themselves

Daf 27a

and he teaches when she was taken as collateral” but not “when she was imprisoned”?
[No] the same applies also to [the case if] she had been imprisoned, and the case just happened this way.
There are those who say: Rav said:
We have also learned this [in a Mishnah]:
R. Yose the priest and R. Zechariah b. HaKatzav testified regarding an Israelite woman, who had been taken as collateral in Ashkelon and her family distanced her and her witnesses testified that she had not been secluded [with a man] and that she was not defiled [by a man].
And the Sages said to them:
If you believe [the witnesses] that she had been taken as collateral, believe [them also] that she was not secluded and that she was not defiled, and if you do not believe [them] that she was not secluded and that she was not defiled, do not believe [them] that she was pledged.
Now Ashkelon where [it happened] for the sake of money, and [yet] the reason [why she was permitted her to her husband was] because witnesses testified concerning her, but if witnesses did not testify concerning her [she would] not [have been permitted]; and is it not [also to be supposed] that there is no difference whether she was pledged or imprisoned?
No, when she was pledged it is different.
Some put in the form of a contradiction. We have learned:
if for the sake of money she is permitted to her husband.
But they raise a contradiction: 
R. Yose testified etc. [Now] in Ashkelon [it happened] for the sake of money and [yet] the reason [why she is permitted to her husband] is because witnesses testify concerning her, but if no witnesses testify concerning her, [she would] not [have been permitted].
And they resolve:
R. Shmuel b. Yitzhak said:
It is no contradiction; here  [it speaks] when the hand of Israel is strong over the non-Jews, [and] there when the hand of the non-Jews is strong over themselves.
If for the purpose of [taking her] life she is forbidden [to her husband].
Rav said:
As for instance the wives of thieves.
Levi said:
As for instance, the wife of Ben Dunai.
Hezekiah said: 
This is only when they have [already] been sentenced to death.
Yohanan says:
Even if they have not yet been sentenced to death.
A town that has been conquered by a besieging troop: all the priests’ wives who are in it are prohibited [from their husbands].  
If they have witnesses, even a slave, even a female slave, they are believed.
A person is not believe about themselves. 
GEMARA. They raised a contradiction against this: 
If a reconnoitring troop comes to a town 
in time of peace the open casks [of wine] are forbidden and the closed ones are permitted.  
In times of war both are permitted, because they have no time to offer libations.
Mari answered: 
To have intercourse they have time, to offer libations they have no time.
Yitzchak b. Elazar said in the name of Hezekiah:
Here [it speaks] of a besieging troop of the same kingdom here [it speaks] of a besieging troop of another kingdom. [Even in the case of a besieging troop] of the same kingdom, it is not possible that at least one of them did not run away [from the rest of the troop]!
Rav Judah said in the name of Shmuel:
When they guard one another.  
[But still] it is not possible that one does not sleep a little! 
Levi answered:
When they placed round the town, chains, wooden sticks and geese.
Abba b. Zavda said: 
With regard to this R. Judah Nesiah and the rabbis argued about this: One said: 
there [it speaks] of a besieging troop of the same kingdom and here of a besieging troop of another kingdom, and he found no difficulties,
Whereas one raised all those difficulties and he resolved [them by saying] 
when they placed round the town chains, dogs, sticks, and geese.
Idi b. Abin said in the name of R. Yitzchak b. Ashian: 
If there is there one hiding place, it protects all of the priestly women.
Yirmiyah asked: 
What is [the law] if [the hiding place] holds only one? 
Do we say 
of each one was the one [who hid there] or do we not say this?
But why is this different from the case of two paths, one clean and one unclean, and someone walked in one of them and [then] prepared clean things and another person came and walked in the second path and [then] prepared clean things. Judah says:
If each one comes to ask separately, they are [declared] clean; [but] if they both come together, they are [declared] unclean.
Yose says: 
In both cases they are [declared] unclean.
And Rava said, and some say R. Yohanan:
[If they come to ask] at the same time, all agree that they are [declared] unclean, if they come one after another, all agree that they are [declared] clean;
they differ only when one comes to ask for himself and for the other one; one treats this as [if it were] at the same time, and the other regards this as [if it were] one after another.
Now here also, since all [ the women] were permitted, it is like [the case where they came] at the same time? 
How now! 
In that case, there is certainly an impurity, [but] here who says that any one has been defiled?
Ashi asked:
If she said, “I have not hidden myself and I have not been defiled,” what is [the law]?
 Do we say

Daf 27b

why would she lie” or do we not say it?
But why should this be different from the following case of someone who hired out a donkey to a person, and he said to him,
“Do not go the way of Nehar Pekod. where there is water, go the way of Naresh, where there is no water.”
But he went the way of Nehar Pekod and the donkey died.
He [then] came before Rava
and said to him:
‘Indeed, I went the way of Nehar Pekod, but there was no water.
Rava:
“Why should he lie?
If he wished he could have said,
“I went the way of Naresh.”
And Abaye said to him: 
We do not say “Why should he lie?’ where there are witnesses.
Now is this so?
There there were witnesses that there certainly was water on the way of Nehar Pekod, but here has she certainly been defiled? 
It is [only] a concern, and in the case of a mere concern we do say [“why should he lie?”].
If there are witnesses, even a slave, even a handmaid, they are believed.
And even her own handmaid is believed.
But we raise a contradiction against this: 
She should not be secluded with him unless there are witnesses, even a slave,
even a handmaid except her own handmaid, because she is familiar with her own handmaid!
Papi said:
In [the case of] a female captive they were lenient.
Papa said: 
In the one case [it speaks of] her handmaid, in the other case [it speaks of] his handmaid.
But is her handmaid really not believed? 
Does it not teach 
“No one may testify as to himself?” [Implying] her handmaid is believed!  
Her handmaid is like herself.
Ashi said: 
In both cases [it speaks of] her handmaid. A handmaid sees and is silent. 
There, where her silence makes her permitted, she is not believed, but here, where her silence makes her forbidden she is believed.
Now also, she may come and lie?  
Two [things] she would not do.
As in the case of Mari b. Isak [or as some say of Hana b. Isak], a brother came to him from Be-Hozae 
and said to him: 
Give me a share in the property of our father. 
He answered him: 
I do not know you.
He [then] came to R. Hisda, and he said to him: 
He answered you well, for it is written: “And Joseph knew his brothers, but they did not know him” (Genesis 22:8) This teaches that he went away before he had grown a beard and he came back after growing a beard.
[Then] he said to him: 
I Go and bring witnesses that you are his brother. 
He answered him: 
I have witnesses, but they are afraid of him, because he is a powerful man. 
He [then] said to the other man: 
Go you and bring witnesses that he is not your brother. 
He answered him: 
Is this the law? 
[Surely] he who wishes to extract money from his fellow, must provide the evidence. 
He said to him: 
This is how I rule for you and all who are powerful like you!
But they might still come and lie? 
Two things they will not do.
Shall we say that this difference is like that between [these] tannaim? [For it was taught]:
This testimony: a man and a woman, a boy and a girl, her father and her mother, her brother and her sister [may testify], but not her son and her daughter, nor her slave and her handmaid.
And in another [baraita] it was taught:
All are believed to testify [for her] except herself and her husband.
Now the views of R. Papi and R. Ashi are [certainly] according to the difference of the Tannaim. 
But is the view of R. Papa according to the Tannaim?
Papa could answer you: 
When that baraita was taught, it referred to a woman who talked in her simplicity.
Like that which R. Dimi said when he came: R. Hanan of Carthage told a story: 
A case came before R. Joshua b. Levi (or as some say R. Joshua b. Levi told a story: 
A case came before Rabbi): Someone was talking in his simplicity and said: 
I and my mother were taken captives among the non-Jews. When I went out to draw my water, my mind was on my mother.   [When I was out] to gather wood, my mind was on my mother. 
And Rabbi allowed her to marry a priest by [the words of] his mouth. 
Rabbi Zechariah ben Ha-katzav said: 
“By this temple! 
Her hand did not move out of my hand from the time that the non-Jews entered Jerusalem until they departed.”
They said to him: 
“No one may testify concerning himself.”
GEMARA. It has been taught: 
And nevertheless, he set aside a house for her in his courtyard, and when she would go out, she went out at the head of her children, and when she would come in, she came in at the head of her children.
Abaye asked: 
May one do so with regard to one’s divorcee?  
[Do I say:] There it was allowed because in [the case of] a captive woman they were lenient, but not here. Or is there no difference?
Come and hear: 
It has been taught: If someone has divorced his wife, she may not get married [and live] in his neighborhood. 

Daf 28a

And if he was a priest she must not live with him in the [same] alley. 
If it was a small village, such a case happened, and they said:
A small village is considered a neighborhood.
Who must give way before whom?
Come and hear: It has been taught: 
She must give way before him, but he does not give way before her, 
but if the courtyard belonged to her, he must give way before her.
The question was asked: 
If the courtyard belonged to both, what is [the law]? 
Come and hear:
 “She must give way before him.” 
What are we dealing with here?  
If the courtyard belongs to him it is obvious; 
and if the courtyard belongs to her, has it not been taught:
“If the courtyard belongs to her, he gives way before her”? 
Thus is it not in such a case! 
[No.] Perhaps [it deals with a case] when they rented [the courtyard].
What then do we know about this? 
Come and hear:
 [It is written:] “The Lord will hurl you away violently as a man” (Isaiah 22:17) and Rav said: 
Moving about is harder for a man than for a woman.
Our Rabbis taught:
If he borrowed from the property of her father, she collects the payment only through another person.  
Shesheth said:
And if they [both] come before us to court, we do not deal with them.
Papa said:
We excommunicate them.
Huna, the son of R. Joshua said: 
We even order them to be lashed.
Nahman said: 
It is taught in [Tractate] Evel Rabbati : 
To what does this refer? To a case when she was divorced after marriage, but if she was divorced after betrothal, she may collect the payments herself, because he is not [so] familiar with her.
Once a betrothed and his [former] fiancee came before Rava, and R. Adda b. Matanah, sat before him. Rava placed a messenger between them. 
R. Adda b. Matanah said to him: 
Did not R. Nahman say: “It is taught in Evel Rabbathi etc.”? 
He answered him: 
We see that they are familiar with one another.
There are those who say: 
Rava did not place a messenger between them. 
R. Adda b. Matanah said to him: 
Let the Master place a messenger between them. 
He answered him: 
Did not R. Nahman say: 
“It is taught in Evel Rabbati, etc.”?
He said to him:
This refers to a case where they are not familiar with one another, but [as to] these, I see that they are familiar with one another.
The following are believed to testifying when they are grown-up about what they saw when they were minors:
A person is believed to say “This is the handwriting of my father”, “This is the handwriting of my teacher”, “This is the handwriting of my brother”;
“I remember that that woman went out with a hinuma and an uncovered head”;
“That that man used to go out from school to immerse in order to eat terumah”;
“That he used to take a share with us at the threshing floor”; “That this place was a bet ha-peras”;
“That up to here we used to go on Shabbat”;
But a man is not believed when he says: “So-and-so had a path in this place”; “That man had a place of standing up and eulogy in this place”.
R. Huna b. Joshua said:
[This is] only when a grown up person is with him.  
And it is necessary [to teach all three cases]: For if he had taught us [with regard to] his father, [I might say] that is because he was always with him, but [with regard to] his teacher [he would] not [be believed].
And if he had taught us [with regard to] his teacher, [I might say] that is because he had reverence for his teacher, but not his father.
And if he had taught us these two [cases], [I might say with regard to] his father, that is because he was always with him, and [with regard to] his teacher, because he had reverence for him, but [with regard to] his brother, in regard to whom there is neither this nor that ground, I might say [that he is] not [believed]; so he teaches us [that]
since the confirmation of documents is [only] an enactment of the rabbis, so the rabbis believed him regarding what the rabbis enacted.
“I remember that that woman went out with a hinuma and an uncovered head”; 
What is the reason [he is believed]?  
Because most women get married as virgins, so this is only a revelation that we already know.
That that man used to go out from school to immerse in order to eat terumah. But perhaps he was the slave of a priest? 
This supports R. Joshua b. Levi; 
for R. Joshua b. Levi said: 
A man is forbidden to teach his slave the Torah.
But is it indeed not [permitted]? 
Has it not been taught:
 If his master has borrowed from him or his master made him 

Daf 28b

a guardian or he put on Tefillin in the presence of his master or he read three verses in the Synagogue, he does not become free!
There it happened that he read on his own, when we say [that he should not teach his slave Torah] it referred to treating him like a son.
To immerse in order to eat terumah: [Only] with regard to rabbinical terumah.
That he was taking a share with us at the threshing floor. 
But perhaps he was the slave of a priest? 
This was taught according to the one who says: 
One does not distribute terumah to a slave unless his master is with him,
 for it has been taught: 
One does not distribute terumah to a slave unless his master is with him, the words of R. Judah. 
R. Yose says:
 He can say: 
“If I am a priest, give me for my sake, and if I am the slave of a priest, give me for the sake of my master.” 
In the place of R. Judah they used to raise from terumah to the status of a priest; 
in the place of R. Yose t
hey would not raise from terumah to the status of a priest. It was taught: R. Elazar, the son of R. Yose said: Throughout my whole life I never gave testimony. Once I gave testimony and they raised a slave to the priesthood through my testimony. 
Do you really think they raised [a slave to the priesthood through his testimony]! 
Now if the Holy One, blessed be He, does not bring a stumbling through the animals of the pious how much less through the pious men themselves? 
Rather they wanted to raise a slave to the priesthood through my testimony. 
He saw it in the place of R. Yose and he went and testified in the place of R. Judah.
That this place was a bet haperas. 
Why [is he believed]?  
Because [the law of] bet haperas is of rabbinical origin,
for R. Judah said in the name of Rav: 
One blows away [the dust from] a bet haperas and goes [there].
Rav Judah b. Ammi said in the name of Rav Judah: 
A bet haperas which has been trodden upon clean. 
What is the reason? It is impossible that a bone [of the size] of a barleycorn was not trodden down by the foot. 
Up to here we used to go on Shabbat.
He holds that 
the [Shabbat] limits are rabbinical.
But a man is not believed when he says: “So-and-so had a path in this place”; “That man had a place of standing up and eulogy in this place”.
What is the reason?
We do not extract money.
Our Rabbis taught: 
A boy is believed when he says, “Thus my father told me: 
this family is pure. This family is unclean.” 
Do you really mean to say “clean and unclean”! 
Rather, “This family is fit and this family is unfit.” 
“That we have eaten at the ketzatzah of the daughter of So-and-so to So-and-so,” “
That we used to bring hallah and [priestly] gifts to the priest So-and-so.”
But only through himself, and not through someone else.
In all these cases, if he was a non-Jew and he converted, a slave and he was set free, he is not believed.
[But] he is not believed when he says “that man had a path in this place, that man had a place of standing up and eulogy in this place.” 
R. Yohanan b. Beroka said. 
He is believed.
To which [clause] does R. Yohanan b. Beroka refer? 
If I say to the last clause, This is extracting money? 
Rather [it refers] to the earlier clause. 
In all these cases, if he was a non-Jew and he converted, a slave and he was set free, he is not believed. R. Yohanan b. Beroka says: 
He is believed.
What are they arguing about? 
The first Tanna holds: 
Since he was a non-Jew he would not pay special attention to it, and R. Yohanan b. Beroka holds: 
Since he had it in his mind to become a convert he would pay special attention to it.
What is ketzatzah? — 
The rabbis taught: 
How does a ketzatzah take place? 
If one of the brothers has married a woman who is unworthy of him, the members of the family come together, bring a cask full of fruit, break it in the middle of the open place and say,
 “Brethren of the house of Israel, hear. 
Our brother So-and-so has married a woman who is not worthy of him, and we are afraid lest his descendants will mix with our descendants. Come and take for yourselves a sign for future generations, that his descendants shall not mix with our descendants.” 
This is the ketzatzah with regard to which a child is believed when he testifies.
May we return to you, the chapter “the woman who was widowed.”

Daf 29a

These are girls to whom the fine is due:
If one had intercourse with a mamzeret, a netinah, a Samaritan;
Or with a convert, a captive, or a slave-woman, who was redeemed, converted, or freed [when she was] under the age of three years and one day.  
If one had intercourse with his sister, with the sister of his father, with the sister of his mother, with the sister of his wife, with the wife of his brother, with the wife of the brother of his father, or with a woman during menstruation, he has to pay the fine, [for] although these are punishable through karet, there is not, with regard to them, a death [penalty inflicted] by the court.
These prohibited maidens get the fine, [but] fit ones [do] not?
This is what it mean: 
These are prohibited maidens who get the fine.
If anyone had intercourse with a mamzeret, a netinah, a Samaritan, etc.
A young girl [receives a fine], [but not] a minor.  
Who is the Tanna [who taught this]? Rav Judah said in the name of Rav: 
It is R. Meir, 
for it has been taught: 
A small girl from the age of one day until [the time that] she grows two pubic hairs, [the laws of] sale apply to her, but not the [laws of] fine; 
from [the time that] she grows two pubic hairs until she becomes mature, the [laws of the] fine apply to her, but not [the laws of the] sale, the words of R. Meir; 
for R. Meir said: 
Wherever sale applies, the fine does not apply, and wherever the fine applies, sale does not apply.
But the Sages say: 
A small girl from the age of three years and one day until [the time that] she becomes mature — the fine applies to her.
The fine yes but not the sale! 
Say:

Daf 29b

also the fine [applies] when the sale [applies].
But are these entitled to the fine!   
Why?
It reads here: “And she shall be his wife” (Deuteronomy 22:29), [that means] one who is fit to be his wife? 
Resh Lakish: 
[It is written:] “na’arah,” “na’arah”, “ha-na’arah” 
once is necessary for itself, once to include those prohibited by negative commandment and once to include those punishable with karet.
Papa said: 
[It is written:] “virgin,” “virgin,” “the virgins,” (Exodus 22:15-16) 
once is necessary for itself, once to include those prohibited by negative commandment and once to include those punishable with karet.
Why does R. Papa not agree with Resh Lakish?
That [verse] he requires for [the same teaching] as that of Abaye,
for Abaye said: 
If he had relations with her and she died, he is exempt, for it is said: “And he shall give to the father of the young girl” [this means]: To the father of the young girl, but not to the father of a dead [person].
And why did not Resh Lakish say the same as R. Papa? 
That [verse] he requires for an analogy (gezerah shavah) 
for it is taught: 
[It is written:] “He shall pay money according to the bride-price (mohar) of virgins,” (Exodus 22:16)  [this means that] this shall be like the mohar of virgins, and the mohar of virgins shall be like this. 
But Resh Lakish also requires it for [the same teaching] as that of Abaye, and R. Papa also requires it for the gezerah shavah (the analogy)?
Rather, six words are written:
“maiden”, “maiden”, “the maiden”, “virgin”, “virgins”, “the virgins”: Two [are necessary] for themselves, one for the teaching of Abaye, and one for the gezerah shave,
[and] two remain over: once to include those prohibited by negative commandment and once to include those punishable with karet.
This [mishnah] excludes [the view of] the following tanna:
For it has been taught:
“And she shall be his wife” (Deuteronomy 22:29). Shimon the Yemenite says:
A woman who can become his wife; 
R. Shimon b. Menasya says: 
A woman who can remain his wife.
What difference is there between them? 
Zera said:
The difference between them is with regard to a mamzeret and a netinah.
According to him who says that she can become his wife, here also there is the possibility of her becoming his wife. And according to him who says that there must be the possibility of her remaining his wife, here there is not the possibility of her remaining his wife.
 But according to R. Akiva, who says: 
There can be no betrothal when [the woman] is prohibited by a negative commandment, what is the difference between them?
There is a difference between them in the case of a widow who marries a high priest, and this according to R. Simai, 
for it is taught: R. Simai says:
Of all R. Akiba makes mamzerim, except [the offspring of] a widow and a high priest, for the Torah says: “He shall not take” and “he shall not profane,” (Leviticus 21:14-15) [this teaches that] he makes [his offspring] profane, but not mamzerim.
And according to R. Yeshebav, who says: 
Come and let us cry out against Akiba b. Joseph, who says:
Whenever the marriage is forbidden in Israel the child [of such marriage] is a mamzer, 
what is the difference between them?
The difference between them 

Daf 30a

is with regard to the marriage between an Egyptian or an Edomite [woman], in which case there is a transgression [merely] of a positive law.
That is all right if R. Yeshebav [by his statement] only came to exclude the view of R. Simai.  
But if his statement was his own, whenever the marriage is forbidden in Israel, the child [of such a marriage] is a mamzer even in the case of a positive commandment. What is [then] the difference between them?
The difference between them is with regard to a non-virgin married to a high priest.
And why is this different?
It is a law which does not apply to all.
Hisda said: 
All agree that he who has intercourse with a woman during menstruation has to pay the fine,
for according to him who holds that there must be the possibility of her becoming his wife, she can become his wife, and according to him who holds that there must be the possibility of her remaining his wife, she can remain his wife.
But [our mishnah] excludes the view of R. Nehunia b. HaKaneh, f
or it is taught: R. Nehunia b. HaKaneh, made Yom Kippur equal to Shabbat with regard to payment; 
just as [he who desecrates] Shabbat forfeits his life and is free from payment, so too [he who desecrates] Yom Kippur forfeits his life and is free from payment.
What is the reason of R. Nehunia b. Hakaneh?
Abaye said: 
It is said “harm” (Exodus 21:22) [in the case of death] by the hand of man, and it is said “harm” (Genesis 42:38) [in the case of death] by the hand of heaven. Just as in the case of the “harm” done by the hand of man one is free from payment, so too in the case of “harm” done by the hand of heaven, one is free from payment.
Ada b. Ahava raised a difficulty: 
How [do you know] that Jacob warned his sons against cold and heat, which are by the hand of heaven?
Perhaps [he warned them] against lions and thieves, which are “by the hand of man?”  Did Jacob warn them against this and not against that?  
Jacob warned then against every kind of harm.
[But] are cold and heat by the hand of heaven? 
Is it not taught: 
Everything is “by the hand of heaven” except cold and heat, for it is said: “Cold and heat are in the path of the crooked; he that values his life will keep far from them” (Proverbs 22:5)?
Further, 
are lions and thieves “by the hand of man”? 
Did not R. Joseph say and R. Hiyya teach: 
Since the day of the destruction of the Temple, although the Sanhedrin ceased, the four forms of capital punishment have not ceased?
“They have not ceased”!!? 
Surely they have ceased! 
Rather 

Daf 30b

the judgment of the four forms of capital punishment has not ceased.  
He who would have been sentenced to stoning, either falls down from the roof or a wild beast runs him down. 
 He who would have been sentenced to burning, either falls into a fire or a serpent bites him. 
He who would have been sentenced to decapitation is either delivered to the government or robbers come upon him. 
He who would have been sentenced to strangulation, is either drowned in the river or dies from suffocation.
Rather reverse it: 
Lions and thieves are “by the hands of heaven” and cold and heat are by the hands of man.
Rava said: 
The reason [for the view] of R. Nehunia b. Hakaneh, is from here: 
“And if the people of the land should shut their eyes from that man, when he gives of his offspring to Molech, [and not put him to death]; then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off” (Leviticus 20:5). The Torah says: 
My karet is like your death penalty; just as [in the case of] your death penalty one is free from payment, so in the case of my karet one is free from payment.
What is the difference between Rava and Abaye?
The difference is [with regard to] a non-priest who ate terumah. 
According to Abaye he is free [from payment], and according to Rava he is obligated [to pay].
But according to Abaye is he exempt? 
Did not R. Hisda say:
R. Nehunia  ben Hakaneh admits that he who stole [forbidden] fat belonging to his neighbor and ate it, is liable [to pay],   because he was guilty of stealing before he came to [the transgression of] the prohibition with regard to [forbidden] fat?  
Hence as soon as he lifted it up he acquired it, but he did not become liable for death until he ate it. 
Here also, when he lifted it up he acquired it, but he did not become liable for death until he had eaten it! 
Here we refer to a case where his friend stuck it into his mouth.
[But] even then, as soon as he chewed it, he acquired it, but he is not liable for death until he has swallowed it!  
When [his friend] stuck it into his esophagus.
What is this case? 
If he can give it back, let him give it back. And if he cannot give it back, why is he guilty?  
It is only necessary when he can give it back only with an effort.
Papa said: 
When his friend put liquids of terumah into his mouth.
Ashi said: 
When a non-priest ate his own terumah 

Daf 31a

and [at the same time] tore the silk garments of his neighbor. 
The [above] text [stated]: R. Hisda said: 
R. Nehunia b. Hakaneh agrees that, if someone stole [forbidden] fat belonging to his neighbor and ate it, he is liable [to pay], because he was guilty of stealing before he came to the prohibition with of [forbidden] fat.
Shall we say he disagrees with R. Abin? For R. Abin said: 
If someone threw an arrow [on Shabbat] from the beginning of four [cubits] to the end of four [cubits] and it tore silk garments in its passage he is exempt [from payment], for the uprooting was necessary for the putting down. 
Here too the lifting up was necessary for the eating.
Now is this so? 
There the “putting down” is impossible without the “uprooting”; but here the eating is possible without the “lifting up,” for if he wants, he could bend down and eat.
Alternatively, 
there if he wants to take it back, he cannot take it back; but here, he can put it back.
What is the [practical] difference between the one answer and the other answer?
The difference between them is [in the following case]: One who carries a knife in the public domain and it tore silk garments in its passage: 
According to the answer that the “putting down” is impossible without the “uprooting” 
here also the “putting down” is impossible without the “uprooting.”  And according to the answer that he cannot take it back, here he can take it back.
The text [stated above]: R. Abin said: 
If someone threw [on Sabbath] an arrow from the beginning of four [cubits] to the end of four [cubits] and it tore silk garments in its passage he is exempt [from payment], for the “uprooting” was necessary for the “putting down.”
Bibi b. Abaye raised an objection: 
If someone stole a purse on Shabbat he is obligated [to pay], because he was guilty of stealing before he came to the [transgression of] the prohibition punishable with stoning, 
but if he dragged it along he is exempt [from payment], because the desecration of Shabbat and the stealing come at the same time.
And why? 
Here also we should say: The lifting up is necessary for the carrying out!
Here also we should say: The lifting up is necessary for the carrying out!
[But] is he, in such a case guilty [of trangressing Shabbat]? 
Did not R. Simon say [that] R. Ammi said in the name of R. Yohanan: 
If someone was removing objects from one corner to another corner and changed his mind and carried them out he is exempt because the taking up was not from the outset for that [purpose]?
Do not say [he picked it up] in order to hide it, rather say [he picked it up] in order to carry it out. Here we are dealing with a case where he [paused and] remained standing [for a while].
For what purpose did he stand?
If to adjust [the weight], this is the usual way.
Rather where he stood still in order to rest. But if he stood in order to adjust the weight what is the rule? 

Daf 31b

 He would be exempt. [If so] instead of teaching “but if he dragged it along he is exempt [from payment],” let it teach the distinction in the same case: 
“When was this said?  If he stood still to rest; but if [he stood still] to adjust the weight, he is exempt [from payment]”? 
Rather, whose opinion is this? It is Ben Azzai who said that 
one who walks is like one who stands.
 [But] what would be the rule if he threw [the purse]?  He would be exempt [from payment]. Let him then make the distinction in the same case: 
When was this said? When he walked, but when he threw it, he is exempt.
The case of dragging it along need [to be stated]. Lest you would have said that 
this is not the way of carrying out, so he teaches us [that it is a way of carrying out].
What [kind of purse was it]? 
If large, this is the ordinary way [of carrying it out], and if small, this is not the ordinary way? 
Rather it was medium sized. But where did he carry it to?
If he carried it into the public domain, there is a transgression of Shabbat but no stealing, and if he carried it into the private domain, there is stealing but no transgression of Shabbat!  
No, it is necessary [to state it] when he carried it out to the sides of the public road.
According to whose view? 
If according to R. Eliezer, who says: 
The sides of the public road are like the public road, there is a transgression of Shabbat but no stealing and 
if it is according to the rabbis, who say: The sides of the public road are not like the public road, there is stealing but no transgression of Shabbat?
Indeed, it is according to R. Eliezer, and when R. Eliezer says: The sides of the public road are like the public road, these words refer only to the obligation for transgressing Shabbat, because sometimes people push and go there, but with regard to acquiring, one does acquire there. Why [not]? Because the public is not often there.
Ashi said: 
It refers to a case where he lowered his hand to less than three [handbreadths] and received it. [And this is] according to Rava,
for Rava said: 
The hand of a person is regarded as [a place of] four by four [handbreadths].
Aha taught so.
Ravina [however] taught: 
Indeed, when he carried it out into the public road, for he acquires also in the public ground.
[And] they differ with regard to a deduction from this Mishnah, for we have learned: 
If he was pulling it out and it died in the domain of the owner, he is exempt. But if he lifted it up or brought it out from the domain of the owner and it died, he is obligated [to pay]. 
Ravina makes a deduction from the first clause, and R. Aha makes a deduction from the second clause. 
Ravina makes a deduction from the first clause: 
“If he was pulling it out and it died in the domain of the owner, he is exempt.” 
The reason [he is exempt] is because it died in the domain of the owner, but if he had brought it out from the domain of the owner and it died, he would have been obligated [to pay]. 
Aha makes a deduction from the second clause:
“But if he lifted it up or brought it out [etc.]” Bringing out is like lifting up; just as lifting up is [an act through which the object] comes into his possession,
so too bringing out [must he an act through which the object] comes into his possession.
According to R. Aha the first clause is difficult and according to Rabina the second clause is difficult?
The first clause is not difficult to R. Aha,
for as long as it has not come into his possession it is called “in the domain of the owner.”  
The second clause is not difficult to Ravina, 
for we do not say [that] bringing out is like lifting up.
One who has sex with his sister, or with the sister of his father, etc.
They raised a contradiction against this: 
The following persons receive [the punishment of] lashes:
He who has intercourse with his sister, with the sister of his father, with the sister of his mother, with the sister of his wife, with the sister of his brother, with the wife of the brother of his father, or with a woman during menstruation,

Daf 32a

and we hold that one does not receive lashes and pay!
Ulla said: 
There is no difficulty. 
Here [it speaks] of his sister [who is] a young girl, and there [it speaks] of his sister [who is] a mature girl.
[But in the case of] his sister [who is] a mature girl, too, [there are damages to be paid for the] shame and damage?
It refers to one not of sound senses.
But [there are still damages to be paid for] the pain? 
[It speaks of] a girl who was seduced.
Now that you have come to this, you can even say [that it speaks of] his sister [who was] a young girl [and namely when she was] an orphan and [she was] seduced.
Therefore Ulla holds:
 Wherever there is a monetary payment and the punishment of lashes, he pays the money and does not receive the lashes. 
From where does Ulla derive this?
He derives it from [the law with regard to] one person who injures another person.
Just as when one person injures another person, where there is a monetary payment and the punishment of lashes, he pays the money and does not receive the lashes,
so too whenever there is a payment of money and a punishment of lashes, he pays the money and does not receive the lashes. But it is different with [the case of] one who injures another because he is liable for five things?And [if you will say] that [the payment of] money is still lighter, [one can say against this] that [here it has been excepted] from its rule [and] permitted to the court!  
Rather he derives it from the case of plotting witnesses. 
Just as in the case of plotting witnesses, whose transgression involves the payment of money and the punishment with lashes, they pay the money but do not receive the lashes, so too whenever there is payment of money and the punishment of lashes, he pays the money and does not receive the lashes.
[But it may be argued] it is different with the case of plotting witnesses, because they do not require a warning? [And if you will say] that [the payment of] money is lighter, [one can say against this,] that they have not done any deed!
Rather he derives it from both (plotting witnesses and personal injury). 
The point common to both is that there is the payment of money and the punishment of lashes, and in either case he pays the money and does not receive the lashes. So whenever there is payment of money and the punishment of lashes, he pays the money and does not receive the lashes.
But [it may be argued] the point common to both is [also] that they both have a strict side? And if [you will say that the payment of] money is lighter, [one can say against this] that they have both a lighter side?

Daf 32b

Rather, Ulla derives it from the two words “tahat:”  It is written here “Since (tahat) he has laid with her” (Deuteronomy 22:29) and it is written there: “Eye for (tahat) eye.” Just as there he pays money and does not receive lashes, so wherever there is the payment of money and the punishment of lashes, he pays money and does not receive the lashes.
Yohanan said:
You can even say that it speaks of his sister who was a young girl [and you can resolve the contradiction in the following way]:
Here it speaks of a case where they warned him, and here it speaks of a case where they did not warn him.
Therefore, R. Yohanan holds that
wherever there is the payment of money and the punishment of lashes and they warned him, he receives the lashes and does not pay the money. 
From where does R. Yohanan derive this?
The verse says:
“According to his guilt” (Deuteronomy 25:2); you punish him because of one guilt but not because of two guilts, and immediately following [it says]: “He shall strike him with forty lashes.”
But behold when one person injures another person, in which case there is the payment of money and the punishment of lashes, he pays money and does not receive the lashes?
And if you will say that 
this is only when they did not warn him, but when they warned him, he receives the lashes and does not pay — did not R. Ammi say in the name of R. Yohanan that, 
if one person struck another person a blow, for which no perutah can be claimed as damages, he receives the lashes? 
What was this case? 
If they did not warn him, why would he receive the lashes? 
Rather it is clear that
 they warned him, and the reason [why he receives the lashes and does not pay] is because the damages do not amount to a perutah, but if they amount to a perutah he pays the money but does not receive the lashes! 
[It is] as R. Ila said: 
The Torah has expressly stated that plotting witnesses have to pay money; so [here] also the Torah has expressly stated that the person who injures another person has to pay money.
Where was the teaching of R. Ila said? On the following: 
“We testify that So-and-so owes his fellow two hundred zuz” and they were found to be plotting witnesses, they receive the lashes and pay, for the verse that imposes upon them the lashes does not impose upon them the payment, the words of R. Meir; and the Sages say: 
All who pay do not receive lashes.
[And] let us say:
He who receives lashes does not pay? 
R. Ila said: 
The Torah has expressly stated that plotting witnesses have to pay money. 
Where has the Torah stated this? 
Since; it is written: “Then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his fellow” 
(Deuteronomy 19:19); why [is it written further,] “hand for hand” (19:21)? Something that is given from hand to hand. And what is this? Money.
 [And] the same applies to the case of one who injures another. Since it is written: “As he has done, so shall it be done to him” (Leviticus 24:19); Why [is it also stated] “So shall it be given to him” (Leviticus 24:20)?  A thing that can be given from hand to hand, and that is money.
Why does R. Yohanan not say as Ulla? 
If so you would abolish [the lashes accorded to one who transgresses]: “The nakedness of your sister you shall not uncover” (Leviticus 18:9).

Daf 33a

[The same could be said] about one who injures another: If so you would abolish [the lashes accorded to one who transgresses], “He shall not exceed, lest, if he should exceed” (Deuteronomy 25:3). 
[And the same could be said of] plotting witnesses: If so you would abolish [the the lashes accorded to one who transgresses]: “Then it shall be, if the guilty man deserve to be beaten” (Deuteronomy 25:2). 
 Rather [lashing for] plotting witnesses could be fulfilled when [the witnesses testified falsely about someone that he was] the son of a divorced woman or the son of a halutzah. 
[Similarly in the case of] one who injured another, it could be fulfilled when he struck him a blow for which no perutah can be claimed as damages. 
[But you could] also say [with regard to] his sister— it could be fulfilled in the case of his sister who was a mature girl!
Yohanan could answer you:
[The verse] “Since (tahat) he had relations with her” is required for the teaching of Abaye, for Abaye said:
The verse says, “Since he had relations with her.” This [he shall pay] for he has had relations with her, [from which we infer] by implication, that there is also payment for shame and damages.
And Ulla? He derives it from a teaching of Rava,
for Rava said:
The verse says:
“Then the man that lay with her must give to the father of the girl fifty shekel of silver” (Deuteronomy 22:29); for the enjoyment of lying [with her he pays] fifty [shekel of silver], [and from here we infer], by implication, that there is also payment for shame and damages.
Elazar says:
Plotting witnesses pay money and do not receive lashes, because they cannot be warned.
Rav said:
Know it [from the following logic]: When could we warn them?
Could we warn them at first? They will say: We have forgotten.
Could we warn them during the deed? They would [then] leave and not testify.  
Could we warn them at the end? What has been has been.  
Abaye raised a difficulty on this:
Let us warn them immediately after they have given their evidence?  
Aha the son of R. Ika raised a difficulty:
Let us warn them at first and hint to them [afterwards].
 Abaye changed his mind and said:
What I said was nothing.
For if you thought that plotting witnesses require a warning, if we have not warned them, we would not kill them. [But then] is it possible that who they wished to kill without a warning, that they should require a warning?
Surely, we need to fulfill “then you shall do to him as he has plotted to do to his brother,” and this could not be fulfilled.
Samma the son of R. Jeremiah raised a difficulty:
But now [according to your logic], [if the witnesses testified falsely about someone that he was] the son of a divorced woman or the son of a halutzah since this case is not included in “as he had thought etc.” he should require a warning should be required!
The verse says:
“You shall have one manner of law” (Leviticus 24:22) [this means] a law that is equal for all of you.
Shisha, the son of R. Idi, said:
That a person who injures another person pays money and does not receive the lashes is derived from the following:
[It is written:] “And if men fight and harm a woman with child, so that she miscarries,” (Exodus 21:22): [Upon this] R. Elazar said:
The verse speaks of fighting with intent to kill, for it is written, “But if any harm follow, then you shall take a life for a life.”
How did this occur?
If they did not warn him, why should he be killed? Hence it is obvious that he was warned, [and it is held], when one is warned regarding a severe matter one also is warned for a light matter, and [yet] the Torah says: “And if no harm follow, he shall be surely fined.” 
Ashi raised a difficulty: 
From where [do we know] that when one is warned regarding a severe matter one also stands warned for a light matter? Perhaps it is not so!
 And even if we say that it is so, how [do we know] that death is more severe?

Daf 33b

Perhaps lashes are more severe,
for Rav said:
If they had lashed Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, they would have worshipped the [golden] image?
Samma the son of R. Assi said to R. Ashi; and some say [that] R. Samma the son of R. Ashi [said] to R. Ashi:
Do you not make a distinction between a beating that has a limit and a beating that has no limit!
 Jacob from Nehar Pekod raised a difficulty:
hat works for the Rabbis who hold that life actually means [life]. But according to Rabbi, who holds that it means money, what is there to say?
Rather R. Jacob from Nehar Pekod said in the name of Rava:
[It is to derived] from the following verse: [It is written,] “Should he get up and walk about on his staff then he that smote him shall be cleansed” (Exodus 21:19).
Would you think that this one walks about in the market and that one should be killed?
Rather it teaches that they imprison him; if he dies, they kill him; and if he does not die, “he shall pay for the loss of his time, and heal him.”  
Now what is this case?
If they did not warn him, why should he be killed?
Rather it is clear that they warned him, and [it is held], one who was warned for a severe matter stands warned for the lighter matter and the Torah says [that if he does not die] “he shall pay for the loss of his time, and heal him.” 
Ashi raised a difficulty: 
From where [do we know] that when one is warned regarding a severe matter one also stands warned for a light matter? 
Perhaps it is not so! And even if we say that it is so, how [do we know] that death is more severe? 
Perhaps lashes are more severe, for Rav said: ?
If they had lashed Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, they would have worshipped the [golden] image?
Samma the son of R. Assi said to R. Ashi; and some say [that] R. Samma the son of R. Ashi [said] to R. Ashi: 
Do you not make a distinction between a beating that has a limit and a beating that has no limit!
Mari raised a difficulty: 
From where [do you know] that he struck him intentionally, and he is cleansed from execution. Perhaps he struck him unintentionally, and he is cleansed from exile. 
The difficulty remains.
Resh Lakish said: 
Whose opinion is this? R. Meir, who says: .
He receives the lashes and pays [the money]
If it is according to R. Meir, [then one who violated] his daughter should also [pay the fine]?  
And if you will say that R. Meir holds [that] one may receive the lashes and pay [the money], but he does not hold [that] one may receive the death penalty and pay [the money], is this so? 
Has it not been taught:
If he has stolen and slaughtered [an animal] on Shabbat, or has stolen and slaughtered [an animal] for idolatry, or has stolen an ox that is to be stoned and slaughtered it, he shall pay fourfold or fivefold, the words of R. Meir, but the sages exempt him [from payment].
Has it not been stated regarding this: R. Jacob said in the name of R. Yohanan, and some say [that] R. Jeremiah said in the name of R. Shimon b. Lakish: 
R. Abin and R. Elai and the whole company [of scholars] said in the name of R. Yohanan:
It refers to a case where he [who stole the animal] let it be slaughtered by another person.
But is it possible that one sins and another one is punished? 
Rava said:
The Torah says: “And he slaughters it or sells it” (Exodus 21:37); just as the sale is performed by another person, so too the slaughter is performed by another person.
The School of R. Ishmael taught: 
[The word] “or” comes to include the agent.
The School of Hezekiah taught: 
[The word] “instead” comes to include the agent
Mar Zutra raises a difficulty on this: 
Is it anywhere to be found that if he does [the deed] himself he is not liable and if an agent does it he is liable?
He himself [does not pay], not because he is not liable, but because he receives the more severe penalty
But if it had been slaughtered by another person, what is the reason of the rabbis who declare him free [from paying]?
Who are the Sages?

Daf 34a

Who are the Sages? R. Shimon, who says: An unfit slaughtering is not called slaughtering.
This is correct with regard to [slaughtering for] idolatry and [slaughtering of] the ox that is to be stoned, but slaughtering on Shabbat is a valid slaughtering, for we have learned: 
One who slaughters [an animal] on Shabbat or on Yom Kippur, although he is liable for the death penalty his slaughtering is valid?
He holds the opinion of R. Yohanan the Sandler, for it has been taught: 
One who cooks on Shabbat, [if] by mistake, he may eat it; if intentionally he may not eat it, the words of R. Meir. 
R. Judah says: 
[If] by mistake, he may eat it Shabbat is over; if intentionally, he may never eat it. 
R. Johanan the Sandler says:
[If] by mistake, others may eat it after Shabbat but he may not; 
if intentionally neither he nor others may eat it.
What is R. Yohanan the Sandler’s reasoning? 
As R. Hiyya expounded at the entrance of the house of the Patriarch:  
“You shall keep the Shabbat for it is holy to you” (Exodus 31:14).  
Just as what is holy is forbidden to be eaten, so too what has been prepared on Shabbat is forbidden to be eaten.
If [so, you might say that] just as what is holy is forbidden to be enjoyed, so too what has been prepared on Shabbat should be forbidden to be enjoyed?
It says, “to you,” from this we learn: It shall belong to you.
You might think [that it is forbidden to eat] even [what has been prepared on Shabbat] by mistake,
[therefore] it is said: “Those who desecrate it shall surely die” (Exodus 31:14).  I have told you this only when it was done intentionally, not when it was done by mistake.
Aha and Rabina argue about this.  
One says:
What has been prepared on Shabbat [is forbidden] by the Torah, and one says: by the rabbis.
by the rabbis.
The one who says: By the Torah, as we have said [above]. 
[And] the one who says: By the rabbis — the verse says: . 
“It is holy,” “it” is holy, but what has been prepared on it is not holy
According to the one who says [that the prohibition is only] by the rabbis, what is the reason of the rabbis who declare him exempt? 
The rabbis declare him exempt only with regard to other cases.
But [with regard to] one who slaughtered for idolatry [one can ask:] as soon as he has cut a little it has become forbidden, so when he continues the slaughtering he is not slaughtering what belongs to the owner? 
Rava said:
[It refers to a case] when he says [that] he worships it with the completion of the slaughtering.
[But with regard to] the ox that is to he stoned, it is not his that he is slaughtering?  
Rabbah said: 
What are we dealing with here? When he handed it to a guardian and it caused the damage in the house of the guardian and it was sentenced in the house of the guardian and a thief stole it from the house of the guardian.
And R. Meir holds like R. Yaakov and holds like R. Shimon. 
He holds like R. Yaakov who says: 
If the guardian returned it even after the sentence had been completed, it is regarded as returned. 
And he holds like R. Shimon who says: 
that which causes [the gain or loss of] money is regarded as money.
Rabbah said: 
Indeed [it speaks of a case] when he slaughtered it himself an

Daf 34b

and R. Meir holds the view that [though generally] one may receive the lashes and pay, one cannot receive the death penalty and pay but these [cases] 
are different, because the Torah has enacted something novel with regard to a fine, and [therefore]  he has to pay, although he has to suffer the death penalty.
And Rabbah follows his own principle, for Rabbah said:
If he had a kid which he had stolen and he slaughtered it on Shabbat, he is obligated, for he was already guilty of stealing before he came to the prohibition of Shabbat; 
[but] if he stole and slaughtered it on Sabbath he is free, for if there is no stealing there is no slaughtering and no selling.
Rabbah also said:
If he had a kid which he had stolen and had slaughtered it at the place he broke into, he is liable, for he was already guilty of stealing before he came to the transgression of breaking in;
[But] if he stole and slaughtered it in the place he broke into, he is exempt, for if there is no stealing, there is no slaughtering and no selling.
And it was necessary [to state both cases]. For if he had let us hear [the case of] Shabbat [I would have said that he is free from payment] because its prohibition is forever, but [in the case of] breaking in, which is only a prohibition for the moment, I might say, [that it is] not [so].
And if he had let us hear [the case of] breaking in [I would say that he is exempt from payment] because his breaking in is his warning, but [with regard to] Shabbat, [in] which [case] a warning is required, I might say that [it is] not [so] Therefore] it is necessary [to state both cases].
Papa said:
If one had a cow that he had stolen and he slaughtered it on Shabbat, he is liable for he was already guilty of stealing before he came to the prohibition of Shabbat;
If he had a cow that he borrowed and he slaughtered it on Shabbat, he is exempt.
Aha the son of Raba said to R. Ashi: 
Does R. Papa come just to teach us the rule about the cow?
He said to him: 
R. Papa comes to teach us the rule of a borrowed [cow].
Lest you think [that] because R. Papa said 
that he becomes responsible for its food from the time of possession by “drawing it [to him],” here also he becomes responsible for any unpreventable accident from the time of borrowing, so he lets us hear [that it is not so].
Rava said:
If their father left them a borrowed cow, they may use it during the whole period for which he borrowed it; if it died, they are not responsible. 
If they thought that it belonged to their father and they slaughtered it and ate it, they pay the value of the meat at the lowest price.
If their father left them an obligation of property, they are liable to pay.
Some teach it in reference to the first case and some teach it in reference to the second case.  
He who teaches it in reference to the first case, so much the more [does he teach it in reference] to the second case, and he disagrees with R. Papa.  
And he who teaches it in reference to the second case does not teach it in reference to the first case, and he agrees with R. Papa.
It is alright [that] R. Yohanan does not say like Resh Lakish, because he wants to explain it   according to the rabbis. But why does not Resh Lakish say like R. Yohanan?
 He could answer you:
since he is exempt if they warned him, he is also free [even] if they did not warn him.
And they follow their own reasoning,
for when R. Dimi came [from Eretz Yisrael] he said: 
He who has committed inadvertently an act which, if he had committed it intentionally, would have been punishable with death or with lashes, and [which is also punishable] with something else, R. Yohanan says 
he is liable, and Resh Lakish says 
he is exempt. 
Yohanan says
he is liable, for they did not warn him.
Resh Lakish says [that] he is exempt,
for since he is exempt if they warned him, so he is exempt also when they did not warn him.
Resh Lakish raised an objection against R. Yohanan: 
[It is written]: “If no harm comes, he shall be surely fined” (Exodus 21:22). 

Daf 35a

Does this not refer to the law concerning “harm”? 
No, it refers to real “harm.”
Some say: R. Yohanan raised an objection against Resh Lakish: 
[It is written] “And if no harm follows, he shall be surely fined.” Does this not refer to the law concerning “harm”? 
No, it refers to real “harm.”
Rava said:
Is there anyone who holds that he who committed unintentionally an act which, if he had committed it intentionally would have been punishable with death [and which is also punishable with the payment of money] is obligated [to pay money]?
Has not the house of Hezekiah taught:
[It is written] “He that kills a man . . . he that kills a beast:” Just as in [the case of] the killing of a beast you have made no distinction between [it being done] inadvertently and willfully, intentionally and unintentionally, by way of going down or by way of going up, so as to free exempt him [from the payment], but [to in any case] make him liable to pay, so also in [the case of] the killing of a person you shall make no distinction between [it being done] inadvertently and willfully, intentionally and unintentionally, by way of going down or by way of going up, so as to make him liable to pay money, but to free him from paying money?
Rather when Ravin came [from Eretz Yisrael], he said: 
Those who committed inadvertently an act which, if committed willfully, would have been punishable with death [and which is also punishable with the payment of money] — all agree that he is free [from the payment of money],
they only disagree when the act committed inadvertently would, if committed willfully, have been punishable with lashes and something else.
Yohanan says [that] 
he is liable [to pay, because] only with regard to those who commit an act punishable with death, those punishable by death have all been compared together, but those liable for lashes have not been compared together.
[But] Resh Lakish says [that] 
he is free [from making the money payment, because] the Torah has expressly included those who commit an act punishable with lashes to be as those who commit an act punishable with death.
Where has the Torah included [them]? 
Abaye said: ”
It comes from “that wicked man” (Numbers 35:31) and “that wicked man” (Deuteronomy 25:2), 
Rava said:
It comes from “one who strikes” and “one who strikes.
Papa said to Rava: 
Which “striking” [do you refer to]? 
If we say, “And he that strikes a beast shall pay for it, and he that strikes a man shall be put to death,” (Leviticus 24:21) this is written about death.
Rather it this “striking”; 
“He that strikes a beast shall pay for it: life for life” and adjacent to it [comes the following verse] “And if a man wounds his neighbor, as he has done so shall it be done to him?” (Leviticus 24:18-19). 
But here “striking” is not mentioned! 
We mean the effect of “striking.”
But this verse refers to one who injures his fellow, and one who injures his fellow has to pay damages? 
If it does not refer to a “striking” in which there is the value of a perutah, teach it in reference to a “striking” in which there is not the value of a perutah.


Daf 35b

Anyhow, he is not liable to pay damages? 
It necessarily [speaks of a case] where, while he struck him, he tore his silk garment.
Hiyya said to Rava: 
And according to the Tanna of the House of Hezekiah, who says: 
[It is written] “He that kills a man . . . He that kills a beast” [etc.,] how does he know that it refers to a week-day and there is no distinction to be made? Perhaps it refers to Shabbat, [in which case] there is a distinction to be made with regard to the beast itself?
This cannot be, for it is written: “And he that kills a beast shall pay for it, and he that kills a man shall be put to death.” 
What is this case? 
If they did not warn him, why should one who killed a man be put to death? 
Rather it is clear that they warned him, and if [it happened] on Shabbat would he, if he killed a beast, pay for it?  
Therefore it can only refer to a week-day. 
Papa said to Abaye:
According to Rabbah,
who says [that] the Torah has innovated and innovation in the matter of fines and [therefore] he pays although he is killed, according to whom does he place our Mishnah?
 If according to R. Meir, [the law regarding] his daughter is difficult, if according to R. Nehuniah ben Hakaneh, [the law regarding] his sister is difficult; [and] if according to R. Isaac [the law regarding] a mamzeret is difficult?
It would be alright if he would hold like R. Yohanan, [for] he could [then] resolve it like R. Yohanan.   But if he holds like Resh Lakish how can he resolve it?
Therefore you must say that he holds like R. Johanan. 
Matanah said to Abaye: 
According to Resh Lakish who says [that] 
he is free [from paying the fine, because] the Torah has expressly included those who commit an act punishable by lashes to be as those who commit an act punishable by death, who is the Tanna who differs from R. Nehuniah b. Hakaneh? It is either R. Meir or R. Isaac.
Our rabbis taught: 
Forbidden relations and relations forbidden in the second degree, they have no claim to fine [for rape] or for seduction [payment]. 
A woman who refuses [her husband] has no claim to fine [for rape] or for seduction [payment].
An aylonit has no claim to fine [for rape] or for seduction [payment]. And a woman who has gone out on account of an evil name, has no claim to fine [for rape] or for seduction [payment].
What are “forbidden relations” and what are “relations forbidden in the second degree”?
If we say [that] “forbidden relations” 

Daf 36a

are really forbidden relations and prohibitions of the second degree [are those relations which were forbidden] by the rabbis, since she is permitted to him by the Torah, why should she not receive the fine?
Rather,
forbidden relations are those with regard to those punishable by death, prohibitions of the second degree are those punishable by karet. But in the case of prohibitions which are simply the transgression of a negative commandment, they do receive the fine. And whose opinion is it? [It is that of] Shimon the Yemenite.
There are those who say: 
“Forbidden relations” are those punishable by death at the hand of the Court or karet, “prohibitions of the second degree” are prohibitions which are simply the transgression of a negative commandment. Whose opinion is this? That of R. Shimon b. Menassia.
A woman who refuses her husband, has no claim to fine [for rape] or payment for seduction.
But an ordinary minor has a claim [to the fine].
Whose opinion is this? It is the rabbis, who say: A minor receives the fine.
Say now the other clause: 
“An aylonit has no claim to fine [for rape] or payment for seduction,”
this accords with R. Meir, who says: 
The minor does not receive the fine; and this one went straight from her state as minor into adulthood. 
The first clause would then be according to the rabbis and the last clause according to R. Meir?
And if you would say that 
all of it accords with R. Meir, but in the case of the woman who refuses her husband he holds like R. Judah. 
But does he indeed hold the like [R. Judah]? 
Has it not been taught: 
Until when can the daughter exercise the right of refusal?
Until she grows two hairs, the words of R. Meir.
R. Judah says: 
Until the black is more than the white.
Rather it is according to R. Judah, and with regard to a minor he holds like R. Meir.
But does he hold this view? 
Did not Rav Judah say in the name of Rav: 
“These are the words of R. Meir”?
Now if it had been so, he ought to have said: “These are the words of R. Meir and R. Judah”?
This tanna holds according to R. Meir in one thing and differs from him in one thing.
Rafram says: 
What is a “woman who has refused marriage?” One who is able to refuse marriage.
But then let it teach “a minor.”
This is a difficulty.
[It was said above:] “An aylonit has no claim to a fine [for rape] or [payment] for seduction.
They raised a contradiction: 
A woman who is a deaf-mute, or lacking sound senses, or an aylonit, has a claim to a fine [for rape], and a suit can be brought [by her husband] against her concerning her virginity.
What contradiction is there? 
The one is according to R. Meir and the other is according to the Rabbis!
But why did he even raise this as a difficulty?  
He wanted to raise another contradiction:
 A woman who is a deaf-mute, or lacking sound senses, or has reached maturity, or lost her virginity through an accident, her husband cannot bring a virginity claim against her; A woman who is blind or an aylonit, her husband cannot bring a virginity claim against her. 
Summachus says in the name of R. Meir: 
A blind woman, her husband cannot bring a virginity claim against her.
Sheshet said: 
This is not difficult: 
the one is according to R. Gamaliel and the other is according to R. Joshua.
Say that R. Gamaliel holds this view when she makes this claim, but does he hold this view when she does not make a claim.
Yes, since R. Gamaliel holds that she is believed, [we apply], in a case like this, [the verse], “Open thy mouth for the mute” )Proverbs 21:8).
A woman who has reached the age of maturity, one cannot bring against her a virginity claim.
But did not Rav say: 
They give a woman who has reached the age of maturity the whole first night?

Daf 36b

If he claims with regard to the bleeding, it is really so [that he can make a virginity claim]. So what are we dealing with here? Where he claims that he found her to be an open opening.
Summachus says in the name of R. Meir:
A blind woman can have no virginity claim against her.
What is the reason of Summachus?
R. Zera said:
For she may have struck against the ground. 
All others may also have struck against the ground?
All others see it and show it to their mothers, this one does not see it and does not show it to her mother.
A woman who goes out because of an evil name receives no fine [for rape] and or seduction payment.
A woman who goes out because of an evil name is liable to be stoned? 
Sheshet said:
This is what he means:
If an evil name has gone out concerning her in her childhood receives no fine [for rape] and or seduction payment. 
Papa said: 
Infer from this [that] one does not collect [a debt] with an unsound document. 
What is this case?
If we say that a rumor has gone out that the document is forged, and similarly here a rumor has gone out that she has fornicated? Did not Rava say [that]
if a rumor has gone out in the town [that] she fornicated one does not pay any attention to it?
Rather two came and said [that]
she asked them to commit with her a transgression
and similarly here [that] two came and said [that]
he said to them: Forge me [the document].
It is all right there, since there are many licentious men. But here if he has been assumed [to have been a forger], have [therefore] all Israelites been established? 
Here also, since he was going round searching for a forgery, I can say [that] he [himself] has forged it and written it.
And in the following cases there is no fine:
If a man had intercourse with a female convert, a female captive or a slave-woman, who was redeemed, converted or freed after the age of three years and a day.
Rabbi Judah says: a female captive who was redeemed is considered to be in her state of holiness (a virgin) even if she is of majority age.
A man who had intercourse with his daughter, his daughter’s daughter, his son’s daughter, his wife’s daughter, her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter does not pay the fine, because he forfeits his life, for his death is in the hands of the court, and he who forfeits his life pays no monetary fine for it is said, “And yet no other damage ensues he shall be fined” (Exodus 21:22).
GEMARA. R. Yohanan said: 
Both R. Judah and R. Dosa taught the same thing. 
As to R. Judah [we have the ruling] just mentioned. As to R. Dosa? It was taught: 
A female captive may eat terumah, the words of R. Dosa. 
R. Dosa: 
After all, what has that trader done to her? 
Just because he squeezed her between the breasts, has a he rendered her unfit to her priestly husband?
Rava said:
Perhaps that is not so, 
for R. Judah may have said his rule here only in order that the sinner may gain no advantage, but there he may hold the same opinion as the rabbis;
Alternatively, 
R. Dosa may have said his rule only there 
[where it concerns] terumah which is only a rabbinical enactment, but in the case of a fine which is a toraitic law he may have held the same view as the Rabbis? 
Abaye answered him:
Is R. Judah’s reason here “that the sinner should gain no advantage”? 
has it not been taught: R. Judah says, 
“If a female captive was ransomed she remains in her state of holiness, and even if she is ten years old her kethubah is two hundred zuz.”
Now how [could the reason] “that the sinner should gain no advantage” apply there? There also [a good reason exists for R. Judah’s ruling, since otherwise men] would refrain from marrying her.      
Does R. Judah really hold [that a female captive] remains in her state of holiness. 
Has it not been taught: 
A man who ransoms a female captive may marry her,
but he who testifies on her behalf may not marry her,
and R. Judah ruled:
In either case he may not marry her.
The baraita itself is difficult?
You said,
“A man who ransoms a female captive may marry her,” and then it teaches,
“But he who testifies on her behalf may not marry her.” Just because he testifies on her behalf, he cannot marry her?
This is no difficulty:
This is what it means to say:
A man who ransoms a female captive and gives evidence on her behalf may marry her,” but he who merely gives evidence on her behalf may not marry her.
In any case there is a contradiction against R. Judah? 
Papa said: 
Say [the following]:
R. Judah says: In either case he may marry her.
Huna the son of R. Joshua says: 
It can still be maintained as was originally taught: R. Judah was speaking to the rabbis in accordance with their own ruling.
 According to my view [he argued] the man may marry her in either case; but according to your view, in either case he may not marry her.
And the rabbis? 
“A man who ransoms a captive and testifies on her behalf may marry her” because no one would throw money away for nothing; “He who [merely] testifies on her behalf may not marry her” lest he set his eyes on her.
Rav Papa b. Shmuel raised a contradiction  in front of R. Joseph:

Daf 37a

Does R. Judah really hold that [a female captive] remains in her state of holiness. 
Has it not been taught:
A woman convert who saw [menstrual] blood on [the day of] her conversion: R. Judah says: [It is sufficient to reckon her impurity from] the time she [discovered it]. R. Yose says:
She is subject to the same laws as all other women and, therefore, causes impurity [retroactively] for the past period of twenty-four hours, or [for the period] between [her last ] examination and [her previous] examination. And she must also wait three months [before marrying], the words of R. Judah.
But R. Yose permits her to be betrothed and married at once.
The other replied:
You are pointing out a contradiction between a convert 
and a captive? A convert does not protect herself, but a captive does protect herself.
But raise a contradiction between two rulings concerning a captive.
For it was taught:
Converts, captives or slaves who were ransomed, or converted or were manumitted, must wait three months if they were older than three years and one day; the words of R. Judah.
R. Yose permits immediate betrothal and marriage.
[The other] remained silent.
He said to him:
Have you heard anything on the subject?
He said to him: This is what R. Sheshet said:
This is a case where people saw that she had intercourse.
 If so, what could be R. Yose’s reason?
Rabbah said:
R. Yose holds that a woman who fornicates makes use of a contraceptive sponge in order to prevent conception.
This makes sense in the case of a convert, since her intention is to convert, she guards herself.
It also makes sense in the case of a captive [who is also careful] since she does not know where they will take her
It also makes sense in the case of a slave woman [who might also be careful] when she hears from her master.
What, however, can be said in the case of one who is freed on account of the loss of a tooth or an eye?
And were you to suggest that R. Yose did not refer to the case of unexpected occurrence, there is the case of a woman who was raped or seduced which may happen unexpectedly and yet it was taught:
A woman who has been raped or seduced must wait three months, the words of R. Judah, but R. Yose permits immediate betrothal and marriage!
Rather Rabbah said:
R. Yose holds tha
 a woman who fornicates turns over in order to prevent conception.
And the other?
We must be concerned that she might not have turned over properly.
For it says, “And if no harm follows he shall be surely fined” (Exodus 21:22).
Is the deduction made from this text?
Is it not in fact made from the following text:
“According to the wickedness of his crime,” (Deuteronomy 25:2) [which implies] you make him liable for one wickedness but you do not make him liable for two wickednesses”?
One with [the penalties of] death and money and the other with [the penalties of] lashing and money.
And [both were] needed.
For if we had been told only death and money it might have been assumed [that the restriction applied only to the death penalty] because it involves loss of life, but not to lashing and money where no loss of life is involved.
And if we had been told only of lashing and money [it might have been assumed that he is only lashed] because the transgression for which lashing is inflicted is not very grave, but not [to the penalties of] death and money where the transgression for which the death penalty is imposed is very grave. Hence both were necessary.
According to R. Meir, however, who ruled: “One may be lashed and also pay the penalty.” What need was there for the two texts? 
One refers to the penalties of death and money 


Daf 37b

and one refers to the penalties of death and lashes.
And [both texts were] needed. 
For if we had been told only that one cannot be executed and pay a fine, this would be because we don’t punish a person with his body and with his money, but when it comes to death and lashes, both of which are with his body, I might have said that this is one long death, and we should perform it.
And if it had taught us only that he cannot be executed and receive lashes, it would be because we do not do two things against his body, but execution and a fine, where one is against his body and one against his property, I might have said we could do this, therefore both are necessary.
“And you shall take no ransom for one who has killed” (Numbers 35:31)? 
The Torah has stated, “Do not take money and exempt him from death.”
“And do not take a ransom to flee to the city of refuge” (Numbers 35:32). This means do not take money from him and exempt him from exile.


But why two texts?  
One deals with unwitting [killing], and the other with intentional [murder]. And [both texts] were required. 
For if we had been told of intentional murder only it might have been assumed [that the restriction applied to this case only], because the transgression for which death is inflicted is grave, but not to the one of unintentional killing where the transgression is not so grave.
And if we had been told of unintentional killing only it might have been assumed [that the restriction applied to this case only] because no loss of life is involved, but not to intentional murder where a loss of life is involved. Therefore, both were required.
“And no atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is shed on it, but by the blood of him that shed it” (Numbers 35:33)—Why do I need this verse?
It was required for the following:
From where do we know that if the heifer’s neck was broken and then the murderer was found, how do we know that we do not let him go? As it is said, “And no atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.” “So you shall expunge the clean blood in your midst” (Deuteronomy 21:9)
—Why do I need this verse? It is required for that which is taught: 
From where do we know that execution by the sword must be at the neck? Scripture says, “So you shall expunge the clean blood in your midst”– all who shed blood are compared to the heifer with the broken neck: Just as its head is cut at the neck so is those who shed blood [cut] at the neck.
If so, just as there [its head is cut] with an axe and at the back of the neck so here too?
Nahman answered in the name of Rabbah b. Avuha:
 Scripture says, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself” (Leviticus 19:18)—choose for him a good death.
“None proscribed, that may be proscribed of men, shall be ransomed” (Leviticus 27:29)? —Why do I need this verse? 
It is required for that which is taught: 
From where do we know that if a person was being led to his execution, and someone said, “I vow to give his value [to the Temple]” he has said nothing? As it is said, “None proscribed, that may be proscribed of man, shall be ransomed.” 
It might have been true even before his sentence had been completed? Scripture says,
“Of men” and not every man.
According to R. Hanania b. Akabia who ruled that 
the value of such a person may be vowed because its price is fixed, what deduction does he make from the text of “None proscribed”?
He requires it for that which was taught: R. Ishmael the son of R. Yohanan b. Beroka said: 
Since we find that those who incur the penalty of death at the hand of heaven may pay a monetary fine and thereby obtain atonement, as it is said, “If a ransom be placed on him” (Exodus 21:3) it might [have been assumed that] the same law applied also [to those who are sentenced to death] at the hands of men. Therefore, Scripture says. “None proscribed of men can be ransomed.” 
I know this only concerning severe death penalties since [they are imposed for offences] which cannot be atoned for if committed unwittingly; how do I know the same is true for lighter death penalties seeing that [they are for offences] that may be atoned for if committed unwittingly? Scripture says, “None proscribed.
But is this not derived directly from “You shall take no ransom” which implies: 
You shall take no money from him to exempt him [from death]? Why do I need the verse, “None devoted”? — 
Rami b. Hama said: 
It was required. 
Lest I thought that


Daf 38a

this applied only where murder had been committed in the course of an upward movement, because no atonement is allowed when such an act was committed unwittingly
but that where murder was committed in the course of a downward movement, which [is an offence that] may be atoned for if committed unwittingly, a monetary fine may be received from him and thereby he may be exempted [from the death penalty]. Hence we were taught [that in no circumstances may he pay a ransom to avoid a death penalty]. 
Rava said to him,  
Does not this  follow from what a Tanna of the House of Hezekiah [taught]! For a tanna of the house of Hezekiah taught:
It is written] “He that kills a man . . . he that kills a beast:” Just as in [the case of] the killing of a beast you have made no distinction between [it being done] inadvertently and willfully, intentionally and unintentionally, by way of going down or by way of going up, so as to free exempt him [from the payment], but [to in any case] make him liable to pay, so also in [the case of] the killing of a person you shall make no distinction between [it being done] inadvertently and willfully, intentionally and unintentionally, by way of going down or by way of going up, so as to make him liable to pay money, but to free him from paying money?
Rather Rami b. Hama said: 
[The verse is] required 
lest I would say that 
this is so only where a man blinded another man’s eye and thereby killed him, but that where he blinded his eye and killed him by another act a monetary fine must be exacted from him.
Rava said to him: 
This is also deduced from another statement of the Tanna of the House of Hezekiah; 
for a Tanna of the House of Hezekiah [taught:] 
“Eye for eye” but not an eye and a life for an eye?  
Rather R. Ashi: 
It was necessary, 
lest I thought that 
since the law of a monetary fine is an innovation innovated by the Torah, one must pay the fine even though he is also executed. Therefore it teaches us [that he is only executed].
But according to Rabbah, who said that 
the innovation that the Torah innovated with regard to a fine is that even though he is executed he still pays a fine, how does he use the verse, “None proscribed…”
He holds like the first Tanna who argued R. Hanania b. Akavia.
A girl who was betrothed and then divorced—Rabbi Yose the Galilean says: 
she does not receive a fine. Rabbi Akiva says:
 she receives the fine and the fine belongs to her.
 GEMARA. What is the reason of R. Yose the Galilean?  
The verse said, “Who has not been betrothed”—if she has been betrothed she does not receive the fine.
And R. Akiva?  
“Who has not been betrothed”—[in such a case the fine goes] to her father. If she has been betrothed, it goes to her.
If so, then “A na’arah” but not a girl who reached majority age, here too the fine should go to her.
[Likewise the expression] “Virgin” but not one who is no longer a virgin, here too the fine should go to her!
Rather the exclusion is complete, and here too it should be complete!
Akiva could answer you: 
The verse “not betrothed” is required for that which is taught: 
“Who has not been betrothed”—this excludes a girl that was betrothed and then divorced who has no claim to a fine, the word of R. Yose the Galilean.
Akiva said: 
She receives the fine and her fine [is given] to her father. 
Logic would dictate
that since her father is entitled to have the money of her betrothal and he is also entitled to have the money of her fine, just as the money of her betrothal belongs to her father even after she had been betrothed and divorced, so also the money of her fine should belong to her father even after she had been betrothed and divorced.
If so what does Scripture mean when it says “Who has not been betrothed”? It is free for the purpose of a comparison with it and an inference from it by means of a gezerah shavah.
Here it is said, “Who has not been betrothed” and elsewhere it is said, “Who has not been betrothed” (Exodus 22:15). Just as here [the fine is that of] fifty [silver coins] so is it fifty [silver coins] there also; 
and as there [the coins must be] shekels so here also they must be shekels.
And R. Akiva—what did you see [to use] “Who has not been betrothed” for a gezerah shavah and “virgin” to exclude one who was no longer a virgin?

Daf 38b

Why not say 
that “virgin” should be used for the gezerah shavah and “who was not betrothed” [should be used to] exclude a girl that was betrothed and divorced?
 stands to reason that “who has not been betrothed” should be used for the gezerah shavah,  since such a girl is still a na’arah that is a virgin.
On the contrary; “virgin” should be used for the gezerah shavah, for she is still called “one who has not been betrothed.”
It is reasonable, for the body of the one had undergone a change while that of the other had not.
As to R. Yose the Galilean, where does he derive the reasoning [that the payment for rape is the same as that for seduction]? 
He derives it from the following where it was taught: 
“He shall pay money according to the bride-price of virgins” (Exodus 22:16)— that this [payment] shall be the same sum as the bride-price of the virgins and the bride-price of virgins shall be the same as this.
One statement of R. Akiva contradicts the other statement of R. Akiva? 
There were two tannaim, both reciting the statements of R. Akiva.
It goes well for R. Akiva in our Mishnah since the gezerah shavah does not altogether remove the verse from its simple meaning. But according to R. Akiva in the baraita, the gezerah shavah removes the verse completely from its simple meaning!
Nahman b. Yitzchak said.
Read the text [as if it says]: “Who is not betrothed”.
But a betrothed girl is obligated for the death penalty!
I might have said that 
since it is an innovation that the Torah innovated by establishing a fine, even though he is executed, he must still pay.
But according to Rabbah,
who said that the innovation that the Torah innovated with regard to a fine is that even though he is executed he still pays a fine, what can he say?
He holds like R. Akiva in our Mishnah.
Our Rabbis taught:
To whom is the fine given? To her father. Others say:
To herself.
But why “to herself”?  
Hisda said:
We are dealing here with the case of a virgin who was once betrothed and is now divorced, and they differ in the same dispute as R. Akiva of the Mishnah and R. Akiva of the baraita.
Abaye said: 
If he had intercourse with her and she died, he is exempt [from the fine], as it says, “Then he shall give to the girl’s father” (Deuteronomy 22:29) but not to the father of a deceased girl.
The ruling which was so obvious to Abaye was part of a question asked by Rava.
For Raba asked:
Is the age of maturity legally attainable in the grave or not?
Is the age of maturity attainable in the grave and [the fine, therefore,] belongs to her son, or is perhaps the age of maturity not attainable in the grave and [the fine, therefore,] belongs to her father?

Daf 39a

But can she become pregnant?
Did not R. Bibi say in front of R. Nahman:
Three [categories of] women may use a contraceptive sponge:
A minor, a pregnant woman and nursing mother.
The minor, lest she become pregnant and die. A pregnant woman, lest the intercourse cause her fetus to become a sandal. A nursing mother, lest she have to wean her child [prematurely] and this would result in his death.
And what is [the age of such] a minor? From the age of eleven years and one day to the age of twelve years and one day.
One who is under, or over this age should have relations in the normal manner, the words of R. Meir.
But the Sages say:
All of them should have relations in the normal manner, and God will have mercy on them from Heaven, as it says, “The Lord preserves the simple” (Psalms 116:6).
And should you say that this is a case where she conceived when she was a na’arah and gave birth to a child when she was still a na’arah, can she give birth to a child within six months [after conception]?
Did not Shmuel say:
The period between the age of na’aruth and that of bagrut (maturity) is only six months? 
And should you suggest [that he meant to say]
that there were no less but more [than six months] didn’t he say “only”!
Rather this is what he asked:
Is the state of maturity attainable in the grave and her father consequently forfeits [his right], or is perhaps
the state of maturity not attainable in the grave and the father, therefore, does not forfeit [his right]?
Mar son of R. Ashi raised the question in the following manner: 
Does death effect maturity or not?
The question stands undecided.
Rava asked Abaye:  
What if he had intercourse and then she became betrothed? 
The other replied: 
Is it written, “Then he shall give to the father of the girl who was not a betrothed woman”?
But according to your line of reasoning, that which is taught,
“If he had relations with her and then she was married, she keeps the fine”, is it written “Then he shall give to the father of the girl who was not a married woman”?
Is that so! 
In that case, since the state of maturity removes a daughter from her father’s authority and marriage also removes a daughter from her father’s authority [the two may be compared to one another]: Just as [in the case of] maturity, if she attains maturity after he had intercourse with her, [the fine] belongs to the girl herself, so too [in the case of] marriage, if she married after he had intercourse with her, [the fine] belongs to the girl herself. But as to betrothal, does it completely remove a daughter from her father’s authority? 
Surely we learned: 
[In the case of] a betrothed girl her father and her husband jointly may invalidate her vows. 
Mishnah: 1. The seducer pays three forms [of compensation] and the rapist four.
The seducer pays compensation for embarrassment and blemish and the fine; The rapist pays an additional [form of compensation] in that he pays for the pain.
2 What [is the difference] between [the penalties of] a seducer and those of a rapist? 
The rapist pays compensation for the pain but the seducer does not pay compensation for the pain.
The rapist pays immediately but the seducer [pays only] if he dismisses her.
The rapist must “drink out of his pot” but the seducer may dismiss [the girl] if he wishes.
3 What is meant by “he must drink out of his pot”? Even if she is lame, even if she is blind and even if she is afflicted with boils [he may not dismiss her].
4 If she was found to have committed a licentious act or was unfit to marry an Israelite he may not continue to live with her, for it is said, “And she shall be for him a wife”(Deut. 22:29)—a wife that is fit for him.
Gemara. The pain for what? 
The father of Shmuel replied: 
For the pain [he has inflicted] when he thrust her upon the ground. 
Zera raised a difficult:
Now then, if he had thrown her upon silk he would be exempt?
And should you say that the law is so indeed, has it not been taught: R. Shimon b. Judah stated in the name of R. Shimon:
A rapist does not pay compensation for the pain [he has inflicted] because

Daf 39b

the woman would ultimately have suffered the same pain from her husband. But they said to him:
One who is forced to have intercourse cannot be compared to one who acts 
willingly? Rather R. Nahman in the name of Rabbah b. Avuha:
The pain of spreading the legs,
for so it is says, “And you have spread your legs to everyone that passed by” (Ezekiel 16:25).
But if so, the same applies to one who has been seduced? 
Nahman replied in the name of Rabbah b. Avuha:
The case of one who has been seduced may be compared to that of a person who said to his friend,
“Tear up my silk garments and you will be free from liability.”
“My”?
They are her father’s!
Rather R. Nahman in the name of Rabbah b. Avuha:
The smart women among them declare that
one who is seduced experiences no pain.
But do we not see that one does experience pain?
Abaye replied: My nurse told me:
Like hot water on a bald head.  
Rava said:
R. Hisda’s daughter told me,
like the prick of the blood-letting lancet.  
Papa said:
The daughter of Abba of Sura told me,
like hard crust in the jaws.
The rapist pays the fine immediately, the seducer when he divorces her etc.
When he divorces her? Is she his wife?
Abaye said:
Read, “If he does not marry her.”
It was also taught thus: 
Even though they said that the seducer pays only if he does not marry her, he must pay compensation for shame and blemish immediately.
And [in the case of] the rapist and the seducer, she herself or her father may oppose [the marriage].
This goes well with regard to one who has been seduced–it is written, “If her father will refuse” (Exodus 22:16). I know this only about her father, from where do I know that she herself may refuse? Scripture says, “will refuse,” in any case. 
But as regards a rapist, though it makes sense that she [may refuse him since] it is written. “And she will be to him,” (Deuteronomy 2:29) with her consent, 
but how do I know her father [may also object to the marriage]?
Abaye said:
In order that the sinner might not gain an advantage.  
Rava said:
It is deduced from an a fortiori (kal vehomer):
If a seducer who has acted against the wish of her father alone may be rejected either by her or by her father how much more so the rapist who has acted both against the wish of her father and against the wish of her.
Rava did not give the same reply as Abaye, because, having paid the fine, this is not a case of a sinner gaining an advantage.
Abaye does not give the same reply as Rava: [In the case of] a seducer, since he himself may object [to the marriage], her father also may object to it; [but in the case of] a rapist, since he himself may not object [to the marriage] her father also may have no right to object to it.
Another baraita taught:
Although they said that the rapist pays immediately, she has no claim upon him when he divorces her.  
“When he divorces her”!
Can he divorce her? 
Read:
When she demands a divorce she has no claim upon him.
If he died, the fine is regarded as her ketubah.  
Yose the son of R. Judah ruled: 
She is entitled to a ketubah of one maneh.
What are they arguing about?
The rabbis hold that
the rabbis instituted a ketubah in order that it should not be easy for him to divorce her, but [the rapist,] cannot divorce her [therefore she does not receive a ketubah, even if he dies].  
Yose the son of R. Judah holds that 
this man too might torment her until she says to him, “I do not want you.”
The rapist must drink out of his pot.
Rava of Prazkiya said to R. Ashi:
Since the laws of the rapist and seducer are learned from one another, 

Daf 40a

why isn’t this also learned?
The verse says:
“He shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife” (Exodus 22:15). “To be his”—this implies only if he agrees.
What is meant “he drinks out of his pot”? Kahana said: I stated the following argument before R. Zevid of Nehardea:
 Why should not the positive commandment supersede the negative one?
He said to me:
 When do we say that a positive commandment supersedes a negative one? In a case like circumcision on a place of scale disease since otherwise it would be impossible to fulfill the positive commandment, 
but here, if she should say that she did not want to marry him, would [the question of the performance of] the positive commandment ever arise?
An orphan who was betrothed and then divorced—Rabbi Elazar says 
that one who seduces her is exempt but one who rapes her is liable [to pay the fine].
GEMARA. Rabbah b. Bar Hana said in the name of R. Yohanan:
R. Elazar said his statement  in accordance with the method of R. Akiva who ruled: 
She is entitled to the fine, and the fine belongs to her.
How do I know this? As it was taught,
An orphan..Rabbi Elazar says that
one who seduces her is exempt but one who rapes her is liable [to pay the fine].
An orphan! This is obvious! 
Rather it teaches: 
A girl who was betrothed and then divorced has the same status as an orphan. Just as [the fine of] an orphan belongs to the orphan herself so does that of a girl who was betrothed and then divorced belong to the girl herself.
Zera said in the name of Rabbah b. Shila who said in the name of R. Hamnuna the Elder who said in the name of R. Ada b. Ahavah who said in the name of Rav: 
The halakhah is in agreement with R. Elazar. 
Rav called R. Elazar 
the best of the sages.
Mishnah: How is [the compensation that is paid for] embarrassment [reckoned]?
It all depends on the status of the offender and the offended.
How is [the compensation that is paid for] blemish [reckoned]?
She is regarded as if she were a slave to be sold in the market place [and it is estimated] how much she was worth then and how much she is worth now.
The fine is the same for all.
And any sum that is fixed in the Torah remains the same for all.
GEMARA, Why not say that the Torah stated 50 selas to cover all payments?
Zera said:
People would say, “Should one who had intercourse with a princess pay fifty and one who had intercourse with the daughter of a commoner also pay only fifty?
Abaye said to him:
If so, the same might be argued with regard to a slave: “Should [compensation for] a slave who puts holes in pearls be thirty ” [and that for] one who does 

Daf 40b

needlework also be thirty?
Rather R. Zera said:
If two men had intercourse with her, one in a natural manner, and the other in an unnatural manner, it would be argued, 
“Should one who had intercourse with a undamaged woman pay fifty and one who had intercourse with a damaged woman also pay fifty?
Abaye said to him: 
If so, they might say the same about the slave: “Should [compensation for] a healthy slave be thirty [and that for] one afflicted with boils also be thirty?”
Rather Abaye said:
[This is the explanation]: The verse said, “Because he laid with her”: These [must be paid] “because he laid with her,” (Deuteronomy 22:29) but it may be inferred that [compensation for] shame and blemish must also be paid.    
Rava said:
The verse said, “Then the man that lay with her shall give the girl’s father fifty [shekels of] silver” for the benefit of lying [with her] [he gives] fifty. Thus it may be inferred that [compensation for] shame and blemish must also be paid.  
But say [perhaps] that [compensation for shame and blemish should be paid] to her?  
The verse said, 
“Being in her youth in her father’s house” (Numbers 30:17)—all benefits accruing to her in her youth go to her father.
But what about that which R. Huna said in the name of Rav: 
From where do I know that a daughter’s handiwork belongs to her father? 
As it is said, “And if a man sell his daughter to be a slave”, just as the handiwork of a slave belongs to her master so does the handiwork of a daughter belong to her father.” Why do I need this? 
Let him derive it from “Being in her youth in her father’s house”? 
Rather that text was written in connection only with the annulment of vows?
And should you say that 
we might derive [the laws regarding shame and blemish payments] from it, monetary matters cannot be inferred from ritual matters.  
And should you say that we might infer it from the laws of fines, monetary payments cannot be inferred from fines?
Rather, [in the end] it is logical that [it should] belong to her father; for if he wished he could have handed her over to a scoundrel or to one afflicted with boils. 
As to blemish, she is regarded as if she were a slave-woman to be sold.
How do they assess her?
The father of Shmuel said:
They estimate how much more a man would pay for a virgin slave than for a non-virgin slave to serve him.
A non-virgin slave to serve him! What difference does this make to him?
Rather [how much more a man would pay for]
a virgin slave than for a non-virgin slave for the purpose of marrying her to his slave.
“To his slave”! What difference does this make to him?
[We are dealing here] with a slave who gives his master satisfaction. 
Wherever there is the right of sale there is a fine and wherever there is a fine there is no right of sale.
In the case of a minor there is the right of sale and there is no fine; In the case of a young woman there is a fine but no right of sale.
In the case of a girl who has reached majority age there is no right of sale and there is no fine.
GEMARA. Rav Judah said in the name of Rav: This is the words of R. Meir,
but the Sages rule:
She receives a fine even where the right of sale applies.
or it was taught:
A minor from the age of one day until the time when she grows two hairs, she can be sold but no fine is incurred through her. From the time she grows two hairs until she comes of age a fine is incurred through her but no right of sales applies; the words of R. Meir,
because R. Meir has said:
Wherever the right of sale applies no fine is incurred, and wherever a fine is incurred no right of sale applies.
The Sages say:
A minor from the age of three years and one day until the time she becomes adolescent a fine is incurred. 
Only a fine but not the right of sale? 
Read:
A fine also where the right of sale applies.
Hisda said:
What is R. Meir’s reasoning? The verse said, “And she shall be for him a wife”–the text speaks of a girl who may herself contract a marriage.
And the rabbis?
Resh Lakish said:
The verse said, “Na’arah” which implies even a minor.
Papa the son of R. Hanan of Be Kelohit heard this. He went and said it before R. Shimi b. Ashi. 
[The latter] said to him: 
You teach it in reference to that, we teach it in reference to this: 
Resh Lakish said;
One who has brought an evil name upon a minor is exempt, as it is said, “And he shall give them to the father of the young girl” the verse referred to a full “na’arah.”
Adda b. Ahavah raised a difficulty:
The reason is that the Torah wrote “na’arah,” but if not for this I would have thought that even a minor [was included],
but has it not been written, “But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity are not found in the young girl, then they shall bring out the young girl to the door of her father’s house, and [the men of her city] shall stone her” but a minor is not subject to punishment?
Rather, 
here it refers to na’arah, but wherever it says “na’arah” even a minor is included.


Daf 41a

He who declares,
“I seduced the daughter of so-and-so” must pay compensation for embarrassment and blemish on his own admission but need not pay the fine.
He who declares,
“I have stolen” must make restitution for the principal on his own evidence but need not repay double, fourfold  or fivefold.
[He who declares,] “My ox has killed so-and-so” or “the ox of so-and-so” must make restitution on his own evidence.
[If he said] “My ox has killed the slave of so-and-so” he need not make restitution on his own evidence.
This is the general rule:
whoever pays more than the actual cost of the damage he has done need not pay it on his own evidence.
GEMARA. Let it [also teach] “I have raped”! 
He said that this was not even necessary:
It was unnecessary [to state that if a man declared,] “I have raped” in which case he does not blemish her character, that he must pay compensation for indignity and blemish on his own evidence, but [if he declared] “I have seduced,” where he does blemish her character, it might have been assumed that he does not pay [compensation] on his own evidence, hence he informs us [that he does].
Our mishnah does not agree with the following tanna,
as it was taught: R. Shimon ben Judah said in the name of R. Shimon: 
So too with regard to [payment] for embarrassment and blemish, he does not pay on his own testimony because he does not have the power to defame so-and-so’s daughter.
Papa said to Abaye:
What if she is okay [with his testimony]?
Perhaps it is not okay with her father.
[What if it is also] okay with her father?
Perhaps it is not okay with her family members.
[What if it is also] okay with her family members? 
It is not possible that there is not one [family member] abroad with whom it is not okay.
He who says, “I have stolen” must make restitution for the principal etc.
It was stated:
R. Papa said:
Half damages are compensation, but R. Huna the son of R. Joshua said:
Half damages are a penalty.  
Papa said:
Half damages are compensation for he holds that 
as a rule cattle are not safe. By law the owner should have made full restitution, but the Torah had mercy towards him because his cattle have not yet become an attested danger.
Huna the son of R. Joshua said: 
Half damages are a penalty, 
for he holds that 
cattle are safe. By law, the owner should make no restitution at all, but the Torah imposed a fine on him in order that he should guard his cattle.
(Mnemonic: He damaged what, and killed a general rule.)
We have taught: 
The plaintiff and the defendant are involved in the payment. 
This goes well for the one who holds that liability for half damages is compensation, that is why the plaintiff is involved in the payment,
but according to the one who holds that liability for half damages is a penalty: If he receives that which really should not be his, how can he be involved in the payment? 
It is only necessary in reference to decrease in the value of the carcass.
[But have we not] already taught elsewhere?
 “Damage payments:” This teaches that the owner must dispose of the carcass.  
One [of the statements deals] refers to an unattested danger (tam) and the other to an attested danger (mu’ad).  
And [both statements are] required: For if it had taught us about a tam, that may have been because the animal has not yet become mu’ad but not to a mu’ad since his owner has been warned.
And if it had taught us only about a mu’ad, it might have been assumed that it is because the owner pays full compensation but it would not refer to a tam. Therefore, [both rulings were] necessary.
Come and hear:
What is the difference [in the case of compensation for damages] between a tam and a mu’ad?  
The tam pays half damages out of the value of its own body, while the mu’ad pays full damages out of the best of the [defendant’s] estate.  
But it does not teach that in the case of a tam no compensation is paid based on one’s own admission whereas in the case of a mu’ad he does pay based on his own admission?
He taught [some distinctions] and omitted others. 
What [else] did he omit [that should justify the assumption] that he omitted this distinction also.
He omitted [also the payment of] half ransom.
If [the only difference not mentioned] is that of half ransom it is not an omission,

Daf 41b

since that [mishnah] may be the view of  R. Yose the Galilean who ruled that 
[in the case of] a tam half ransom is paid.
Come and hear: 
[One who said:] “My ox killed so-and-so” or “the ox of so-and-so” must pay compensation based on his own testimony. 
Does this not refer to a tam? 
No to a mu’ad.
What [would be the law] in the case of a tam? He would not pay based on his own testimony?
Then instead of stating in the final clause,
“The slave of so-and-so” he does not pay based on his own evidence,” let it draw a distinction in the same case:
“When does this apply? To a mu’ad but in respect of a tam he does not pay based on his own testimony?
The entire [mishnah] deals with a mu’ad.
Come and hear: This is the general rule:
Whoever pays more than the actual cost of the damage he has done does not pay on his own evidence.
[We can deduce that if the payment is] less than the cost of the damage, he must pay based on his own testimony?  
Do not say: 
“[If payment is] less than the cost of the damage [he pays based on his own testimony],” rather say: 
“[If payment] corresponds to the actual amount of the damage he pays compensation based on his own testimony.
But what [would be the law if payment were] less than the amount of the damage?  He would not pay based on his own testimony?
Then let it teach,
“This is the general rule:
Whoever does not pay an amount corresponding to the actual cost of the damage he has done does not pay based on his own testimony” which implies both more or less? 
This is indeed a refutation.
The law [is that the liability for] 
half damages is a penalty.
“A refutation” [of a ruling] and [yet it is] the law?
Yes. Why was the statement refuted? For [the mishnah] does not teach “corresponding to the actual cost of the damage he has done.”
[But such a principle] was not absolute [and therefore could not be taught in the mishnah], since there is the liability for half damages [in the case of the damage done by] pebbles. Concerning which there is a halakhic tradition that the liability is compensation. For this reason, it was not taught.
Now that you have said that liability for half damage is a fine, the case of a dog that ate lambs or that of a cat that ate big hens is unusual, and payment in such a case is not collected in Babylon. 
If, however, they were small, it is usual and they are collected.
If the plaintiff seizes [the property of the defendant] it is not to be taken away from him.  
And if he says, 
“Set me a date [by which the defendant must come with me] to the land of Israel,” we set him a date, and if [the defendant] does not go with him he must be placed under the ban.
In any case, however, [the defendant] is to be placed under the ban; for he is told,
Go remove the damaging [animals] you own, in accordance with R. Natan.
As it was taught, R. Natan said:
How do I know that one may not raise a bad dog in his house or place a shaky ladder in his house? As it is said, “Do not bring blood into your house” (Deuteronomy 22:8).
May we return to you chapter “These are the young girls.”
If a young girl was seduced [the compensation for] her embarrassment and blemish and the fine belong to her father; [and the compensation for] pain in the case of one who was raped.
If the girl’s case was tried before her father died [all the forms of compensation] are her father’s.
If her father [subsequently] died they are her brothers’.
If her father died before her case was tried they are hers. If her case was tried before she became of majority age [all forms of compensation] are her father’s.
If her father [subsequently] died they are her brothers’.
If she became of majority age before her case was tried they are hers.
Rabbi Shimon says 
if her father died before she could collect [the payments] they belong to her. 

Daf 42a

Her handiwork and anything she finds, even if she had not collected [the proceeds] belong to her brothers if her father died. 
GEMARA. What does he teach us?
Have we not [already] learned:
The seducer pays three forms [of compensation] and the rapist four. The seducer pays compensation for embarrassment and blemish as well as the fine, and the violator pays an additional [form of compensation] in that he pays for the pain? 
It was necessary [to teach us  that the compensation is due] to her father.
[But] that [the compensation is due] to her father is also obvious, since a seducer has to pay for it? 
For if [it were to be given] to her, why should the seducer pay her?
He acted with her consent?
It was necessary [to tell us of the case where] she went to trial [to teach us the] dispute between R. Shimon and the rabbis.

“You raped or seduced my daughter” and the other says,
“I did not rape, nor seduce,” 
— “I adjure you,” — and he responds,
“Amen!” he is liable.
Rabbi Shimon exempts him, for he does not pay a fine on his own admission.  
They said to him:
“Even though he does not pay a fine on his own admission, he still pays for the shame and blemish [to the girl], based on his own admission.  
Abaye asked Rabbah:
One who says to another, 
You raped or seduced my daughter, and I have brought you to court and you were ordered to pay me money” and the other replied,
I have neither raped nor seduced her, nor have you brought me to law nor have I been ordered to pay you any money,” and after he had taken an oath he admitted his guilt? What is the law according to R. Shimon? 
Since he stood trial his obligation is considered payment and he is obligated to bring a sacrifice for a false oath
 or even though he stood trial, it is still a fine.
He said to him: 
It is a monetary obligation and he is liable to bring a sacrifice for a false oath.
He raised the following objection: 
R. Shimon says:
It might have been presumed that if one said to his fellow,
“You have raped or seduced my daughter” and the other replied
‘I have neither raped nor seduced her”, 
[or if the first said] “Your ox has killed my slave” and the other replied,
He did not kill him,” 
or if a slave said to his master, 
“You have knocked out my tooth” or “You have blinded my eye” and he replied
“I have not knocked it out” or “I have not blinded it”and [the defendant] swore but afterwards admitted his liability it might have been presumed that he is liable, Scripture says, “And he denies [owing] his fellow a deposit or a pledge or something robbed or he defrauds his fellow, or he finds a lost object and denies it and he falsely swears” (Leviticus 5:21), just as these are distinguished that they are compensatory, so too [one is liable for falsely swearing over all debts that are] compensatory. 
This excludes anything that is a fine.

Daf 42b

Does this not refer to one who had already been tried?
No, it refers to one who had not yet been tried. 
But since the first clause deals with the case of one who had been tried, should not the second clause also deal with such a case?
For in the first clause it was stated: 
I only knew [that liability is incurred in] cases where compensation is paid for the actual value only, how do I know that the same is true with regard to the double payment and the fourfold or fivefold and [in those of] the rapist, the seducer and the one who brings out a bad name?  
Scripture says, “And commit a trespass,” this includes such cases.
How is this statement to be understood? 
If [it refers to] a man whose had not yet been tried [the objection could be raised:] Is double compensation payable in such circumstances? 
Rather it is obvious that [it refers to one] who had already been tried. And since the first clause deals with one who had been tried, the final clause also must deal with one who had already been tried?
He said to him:
I could have solved this for you.
that the first clause deals with one who had already been tried, and the final clause with one who had not yet been tried and that the entire baraita represents the view of R. Shimon, But I would not give you forced interpretations,
for, were I to do so, you might say:
Then either the first clause should begin with “R. Shimon said” or the final clause should conclude with “these are the words of R. Shimon.”
Rather the entire [baraita] refers to one who had already been tried, the first clause being the view of the rabbis and the final clause that of R. Shimon, and I agree with you in regard to the sacrifice for [taking a false] oath, that the Torah has exempted him from [the word] “And he denied.”  When I said, that it is compensation,
I meant that he transmits it as an inheritance to his sons.
He raised an objection against him:
R. Shimon says: 
If her father died before she could collect [the payments] they belong to her. 
Now if you say [that this] is compensation in respect that it is bequeathed as an inheritance to one’s sons, why should the compensation belong to her? 
Should it not, in fact, belong to the brothers?
Rava said
This matter was difficult for Rabbah and R. Joseph for twenty-two years and they could not solve it until R. Joseph sat at the head [of the academy] and solved it: 
There it is different [from other fines] because Scripture said, “Then the man that lay with her shall give to the young girl’s father fifty [shekels of] silver” [which implies that] the Torah has not given the father the right of possession before the money had actually been handed to him. 
And when Rabbah said, “It is compensation in respect that it is transmitted as an inheritance to his sons” he was referring to other fines.
But then, in the case of a slave where it is written, “He shall give (יתן) to his master thirty shekels of silver,” so too here the Torah has not given the master the right of possession before the money had actually been handed to him?
[The word] yiten and [the word] venatan are different.
If so, [instead of deducing the exemption from sacrifice] from, “And he denied” 
it should have been deduced from “And he shall give.”
Rava said: 
The words “And he denied” were required in a case, for instance, where the girl’s case had been brought to court and then she became adolescent and then died, 
in which case when the father receives [the fine] he inherits [it] from her.
If so, how could it have been said “These are excluded [from liability] since they are fines”...
when they are in fact compensation?
Nahman b. Yitzchak said
These are excluded since they are basically fines.
He raised another objection:
R. Shimon exempts him for one does not pay a fine based on one’s own admission. 
The reason is because he has not been convicted but if he had been convicted, 
since he does pay even on his own admission, he would be liable to bring a sacrifice for a false oath.
Shimon was responding to the words of the other rabbis:
According to my own view [he argued] even though he has been tried he is exempt [from bringing the sacrifice as may be deduced] from the text “And deal falsely.” 
But according to your view, however, you must at least admit that [the man is exempt] if he has not yet been tried, since the claim against him is a fine

Daf 43a

and one who makes a voluntary admission in a penal case is exempt.
But the rabbis hold that
he is claiming payment for shame and blemish.
What are they arguing about?
Papa said:
R. Shimon holds that
a man would not leave that which is fixed to claim that which is not fixed, while the
Rabbis hold that
no man would leave a claim  from which [the defendant] could not be exempt even if he made a voluntary admission  and advance a claim   from which he would be exempt if he made a voluntary admission.
Avina asked of R. Sheshet: 
A daughter who is maintained by her brothers, to whom does her handiwork belong?
Are they in place of her father
and as in that case her handiwork belongs to her father so here also it belongs to her brothers; 
or are they not similar to the father, 
for in that case she is maintained out of his own estate but here she is not maintained out of their estate?
He replied: 
We have taught this: 
A widow is to be maintained out of the estate of [her deceased husband’s] orphans, and her handiwork belongs to them.
[But] are they the same? 
A man may not want his wife to be sustained expansively, but he would want his daughter sustained expansively.
That is to say that a man’s daughter is preferable to him than his widow? 
But did not R. Abba said in the name of R. Yose: 
They made a widow and her daughter like a daughter and her brothers in the case of a small estate: just as in the case of the relationship between a daughter and her brothers, the daughter is maintained while the brothers can go begging at [people’s] doors, so also in the case of the relationship between a widow and her daughter, the widow is maintained and the daughter can go begging at [people’s] doors.
With regard to degradation a man gives preference to his widow; with regards to expansive maintenance he gives preference to his daughter.
Joseph objected:
 Her handiwork and anything she finds, even if she has not collected [the proceeds], if her father dies, belong to her brothers. 
The reason then is that [they originated during] the lifetime of their father, but [if they originated] after his death [they would belong] to her. 
Does not [this refer to a daughter] who is maintained?
No; [this refers to a case] where she is not being maintained.  
If she is not being maintained, why does this even need to be stated?
Even according to the who ruled that 
a master can say to his slave, “Work with me and I will not maintain you” the ruling applies only to a Canaanite slave concerning whom “With you” was not written, but not to a Hebrew slave concerning whom “With you” was written in Scripture. All the more [would such a ruling apply] to one’s daughter?
Rabbah b. Ulla replied: 
It was only required in the case of a surplus.
Rava said:
Did not such a great man as R. Joseph know that [sometimes there may] be a surplus and he still raised an objection?
Rather Rava said:
To R. Joseph the mishnah itself was difficult. 
For it was stated,
“her handiwork and anything she finds, even if she has not collected [the proceeds]”;
but from whom [it may be asked] is she to collect anything she finds?
Rather this is what it means: 
Her handiwork is like anything she finds; just as anything she finds while her father is alive it belongs to her father and after his death it belongs to her, so too her handiwork—while her father is alive it belongs to her father, after his death it belongs to her . Thus it may be concluded [that R. Sheshet is refuted].
It was also stated: Rav Judah said in the name of Rav:
 A daughter who is maintained by her brothers, her handiwork belongs to herself.
Kahana said: 
What is the reason? Because it is written, “And you shall give them as an inheritance to your sons after you,” (Leviticus 25:46) “them as an inheritance to your sons,” but not your daughters to your sons.
This teaches that a man does not bequeath as an inheritance the rights he receives from his daughter to his son.
Rabbah raised an objection:
Say that it refers to [payments in connection with] the seduction of one’s daughter, fines and personal injury!
And so did R. Hanina teach:
The verse speaks of [payments in connection with] the seduction of one’s daughter, fines and personal injury!
Is not personal injury bodily pain? 
Yose b. Hanina said: 

Daf 43b

This refers to a case where the wound was on her face.
Rav Zera said in the name of R. Matan who said in the name of Rav: (others says [that it was] Rabbi  Zera who stated in the name of R. Matana who said in the name of Rav): 
The handiwork of a daughter who is maintained by her brothers belongs to herself, for it is written, “And you shall give them as an inheritance to your sons after you,” “them as an inheritance to your sons,” but not your daughters to your sons. This teaches us that a man does not bequeath as an inheritance the rights he receives from his daughter to his son.
Avimi b. Papi to him: 
Shakud made this statement. 
Who is Shakud? Shmuel. But was it not Rav who made this statement?  
Read: Shakud also made this statement.
Mar the son of Amemar said to R. Ashi, 
Thus the Nehardeans say: The law is in agreement with the ruling of R. Sheshet. 
Ashi [however] said: 
The law is in agreement with Rav.
And the law is in agreement with Rav.
If a man gave his daughter in betrothal and she was divorced, [and then] he gave her [again] in betrothal and she was widowed, her ketubah belongs to him.
If he gave her in marriage and she was divorced [and then] he gave her [again] in marriage and she was left a widow, her ketubah belongs to her.
Rabbi Judah said:
the first belongs to her father.
They said to him:
as soon as he gives her in marriage, her father loses all control over her.
GEMARA. The reason is that when he married her off and was divorced, [and then] married her off and she was widowed, but if she had been widowed twice she would not have been fit to marry again.
And the tanna indirectly taught us like Rabbi, who said that 
if [a thing has happened] twice presumption is established.
Judah said: The first belongs to her father. 
What is R. Judah’s reason? 
Both Rabbah and R. Joseph said: 
Since her father has acquired the right to it from the time of the betrothal.
Rava objected: 
R. Judah ruled that 
the first belonged to her father; But R. Judah admits that if a father gave his daughter in betrothal while she was still a minor and she married after she became a mature girl he has no authority over her. 
But why? 
Let him say, 
“Since her father has acquired the right to it at the time of the betrothal”?
Rather if it was said, this is what was meant: 
Both Rabbah and R. Joseph explained: 
Because it was written while she was still under his authority.
From when does he collect? 
Huna replied:
The hundred or the two hundred from the date of the betrothal and the additional amount from the date of the marriage.
Assi said:
Both from from the date of the marriage.
But did R. Huna really say this?
Has it not been stated:
If a wife produced against her husband two ketubot, one for two hundred, and one for three hundred zuz,
R. Huna said,
if she wants to collect the two hundred zuz she can collect from the earlier date, [but if she wants to collect the] three hundred zuz ketubah, she collects from the later date only.
Now [if R. Huna had said this] she should be entitled, to collect two hundred zuz from the earlier date and one hundred from the later date?
But [even] according to your reasoning, let her collect the whole five hundred zuz, two hundred from the earlier date and three hundred from the later date?
Rather 
what is the reason she does not collect all five hundred? Since he did not write to her, “I willingly added to you three hundred zuz to the two hundred” he must have meant to imply: 
“If you want to collect from the earlier date you would recover [no more than] two hundred, but if you want to collect from the later date you would receive three hundred.”

Daf 44a

Here also [it may similarly be said:] This is the reason why she cannot collect [for the additional amount from the earlier date]: Since he did not write to her, “I have added a hundred zuz to the two hundred,” she has forgiven her former lien. 
It was said above:
If she wishes she may collect with this ketubah and if she wishes she may collect with that ketubah  Shall we say [that this ruling] differs from that of R. Nahman
who laid down that if two deeds  were issued one after the other the latter cancels the former? 
Has it not been said in connection with this statement: R. Papa said:
R. Nahman admits that if the man has added one palm, he wrote it for the addition? And here also, [the husband] has added something. 
[To turn to] the original text: R. Nahman said:
Two deeds were issued one after the other the latter cancels the former.
Papa said: 
R. Nahman admits that if he added one palm the insertion, he wrote it for the addition.
It is obvious [that both deeds are valid where] the first [was a deed] of sale and the second [a deed] of gift  [because the owner] intended to improve the other’s rights, as a safeguard against the law of pre-emption;  
And all the more [is this obvious where] the first was for a gift and the second was a sale, for it may then be presumed 
that the latter was written in that manner in order to safeguard the other against a creditor’s rights.
But if both are sales or both are gifts—the second cancels out the first.
What is the reason?
Rafram said:
We can say that [the holder of the deeds] has admitted to the other [the invalidity of the first deed].  
Aha said:
We can say that [the holder of the deeds] has surrendered his security on the first deed.
What is the practical difference between them?  
The disqualification of the witnesses, payment of compensation for usufruct and land tax.  
What is [the decision] about the ketubah?
Come and hear
what Rav Judah said in the name of Shmuel in the name of R. Elazar the son of R. Shimon:
The [basic amount of a] maneh or two hundred zuz [are collected from] from [the date of] the betrothal but the additional amount only from the date of the marriage.
The Sages say:
Both this and that [may be collected only] from the date of the marriage.
The law is:
Both this and that [may be collected only] from the date of the marriage.
The daughter of a convert who converted together with her mother and then committed an act of fornication is subject to the penalty of strangulation.
She is not [stoned] at the door of her father’s house nor [does her husband pay the] hundred sela’.  
If she was conceived in unholiness but her birth was in holiness she is subject to the penalty of stoning. She is not [stoned] at the door of her father’s house nor [does her husband pay the] hundred sela’.  
If she was both conceived and born in holiness she is regarded as a daughter of Israel in all respects.
A girl who has a father but no door of her father’s house; or a door of her father’s house but no father, is subject to the penalty of stoning—[the verse did not state] “the opening of her father’s house” (Deut. 22:21) except as a precept.


Daf 44b

GEMARA. From where do we know this?
Resh Lakish said:
Since the verse says, “That she die” (Deuteronomy 22:23)—this comes to include one whose conception was not in holiness but whose birth was in holiness.
If so, [should not her wrongful accuser] also be flogged and [condemned] to pay the hundred sela’?
The verse says,
“That she die” [implying that she] was included in respect of death but not in respect of the fine.
Why not say that
it comes include one who was both conceived and born in holiness?
Such a person is a proper Israelite woman.
But why not say [Scripture intended] to include one conceived and born in unholiness?
If so what is the purpose of the word “in Israel” (Deuteronomy 22:21)?
Yose b. Hanina said:
A man who brought an evil name upon an orphan girl is exempt, as it is said, “And he shall give them to the father of the girl,” (Deuteronomy 22:19) to exclude this girl who has no father.
Yose b. Avin, or if you want, R. Yose b. Zevida, raised an objection:
“If her father utterly refuses” (Exodus 22:16) this comes to include an orphan girl in respect of the fine, the words of R. Yose the Galilean.
He raised the objection and he himself supplied the answer: 
[This refers to a case] where he had intercourse with her and then she became an orphan.
Rava said:
He is liable. 
From where [did he infer this]? From that which Ammi taught: 
A virgin of Israel, but not a convert virgin.
Now if you assume that in a similar such a case for an Israelite girl he is liable, it is understandable, and that is why it needed to exclude converts, but if you said in a similar such case for an Israelite he is exempt, if he is exempt for an Israelite, why would it need to speak about a convert.
Resh Lakish said:
A man who has brought an evil name on a minor is exempt, as it is said, “And he shall give them to the father of the young girl,” the verse referred to a full young girl.
Aha b. Abba raised a difficulty: 
The reason is because the Torah uses the word “na’arah,” otherwise it would have been said that even a minor [was included]. But has it not been written, “And if the matter turns out to be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found in the young girl, then they shall bring out the young girl to the door of her father’s house and [the men of the city] shall stone her” and a minor is not liable for punishment?
Rather, here it refers only to a “na’arah” but any place where “na’ar” is written, it refers even to a minor.
Shila taught:
There are three modes [of execution] in the case of a [betrothed] young girl [who committed adultery]:
If witnesses appeared against her in the house of her father-in-law [testifying] that she fornicated in her father’s house 

Daf 45a

she is stoned at the door of her father’s house, as if to say,
“See what you have raised.”
If witnesses came [to testify] against her in her father’s house that she played the harlot in her father’s house she is stoned at the entrance of the gate of the city.
If she committed adultery and then became of majority age, she is condemned to strangulation.
This implies that wherever there occurred a change in one’s body, the mode of execution is also changed.
But they raise the following against this: 
If a betrothed young girl fornicated and after she reached majority age, her husband brought out a bad name against her, he is not flogged nor does he pay the hundred sela, but she and the witnesses who testified falsely against her are hurried to the place of stoning’?  
She and the witnesses who testified falsely against her!
Rather
she or her witnesses are hurried to the place of stoning.
Rava said:
You referred to [the law about a husband] who brought out an evil name; the law of one who brings out an evil name is different,because it is an anomaly.
For, in general, if a girl entered the bridal chamber and did not have intercourse, and then committed adultery, she is condemned to strangulation, but [a woman upon whom a husband] brought an evil name is condemned to stoning.
Huna the son of R. Joshua said to Rava: 
Perhaps when the Torah created the anomaly it was only where her body had not changed, but where her body did change, the Torah did not make an anomaly.
Rather R. Nahman b. Yitzchak said:
The question of whether a change in body effects a change in punishment is [a point of dispute between] Tannaim. For we have learned:
If they transgressed before they were appointed, and afterwards they were appointed, they are regarded as regular people. 
Rabbi Shimon said: 
if their sin came to their knowledge before they were appointed they are liable, but if after they were appointed they are exempt.

Daf 45b

Say that we have heard that R. Shimon follows [the time of] the awareness also, but did you hear him say that he follows the time of realization and not the time of the sin?
For were that so, should they not have brought an offering in accordance with their present status, the High Priest a bull, and the chief a he-goat?
Surely R. Yohanan said to the Tanna: 
Teach, She is to be condemned to stoning. 
But why?
Did not the Torah speak of a betrothed young girl and this one is of majority age?
R. Ila replied:
The verse said, “The young girl” [implying] her who was a young girl before.
Hanania to R. Ila:
If so, should not [the husband] also be flogged and pay the hundred sela?
He said back to him:
May the All-Merciful one save us from such an opinion. 
“On the contrary, may the All-Merciful save us from such an opinion as yours.
What is the reason? 
Yitzchak b. Avin, or, as some say, R. Yitzchak b. Abba, replied:
In her case it was her behavior that brought about her [punishment] but in his case it was is the perversion of his lips that brought about his [penalties].
In her case it was her behavior that brought about her [punishment]’ and when she fornicated she was still a na’arah.  
But in his case it was the perversion of his lips that brought about his [penalty]’; and when did he incur his guilt? At that time, and at that time she was already adolescent. 
Our rabbis taught: 
A betrothed young girl who fornicated is stoned at the door of her father’s house.
If she had no door of her father’s house she is stoned at the door of the gate of that city.
But in a town which is mostly inhabited by non-Jews she is stoned at the door of the court.
Similarly you may say:
A man who worships idols is to be stoned at the gate [of the city] where he worshipped,
and in a city the majority of whose inhabitants are idolaters he is stoned at the door of the court. 
From where are these rules [derived]?
From that which our Rabbis have taught: 
“Your gates”  this refers to the gate [of the city] where the man has worshipped. 
You say, “The gate [of the city] where the man has worshipped” or might it not mean the gate where he was tried?
 It says “your gates” below and it says “your gate” above, just as “your gates” referred to above refers to the gates where he worshipped, so too “your gates” referred to below refers to the gates where he worshipped.
Another interpretation: 
“Your gates” but not the gates of non-Jews.  
But this phrase “Your gates” have you not already deduced something from it?   
If so, the verse should have said “gate”; why “Your gates”? 
You can learn from it two things.
Thus we have derived this rule with regard to idolatry, from where do we [derive the law in respect of] a betrothed girl?  
Abbahu replied: 
We learn “door” from “door” and “door” from “gate”  and “gate” from “your gates.”
Our rabbis taught:
[A husband] who brings up an evil name [upon his wife] is flogged and he must also pay a hundred sela’.
R. Judah said: 
As to flogging, [the husband is] flogged in all circumstances;
as to the hundred sela’, where he had intercourse with her he pays but if he did not have intercourse with her he does not pay.
They differ on the same principles as those on which R. Eliezer b. Jacob and the Rabbis differed, 
and this is what they meant:
[A husband] who brought an evil name [upon his wife] is flogged and he must also pay a hundred sela’, whether he had intercourse, or did not have intercourse with her, [this being] in agreement with the Rabbis.  
Judah ruled: 
As to flogging [the husband is] flogged in all circumstances;
as to the hundred sela’, where he had intercourse with her he pays but if he did not have intercourse with her he does not pay; this is in agreement with R. Eliezer b. Jacob.
Other say: 
Everyone is in agreement with R. Eliezer b. Jacob   and this is what they mean: 
[A husband] who brought an evil name [upon his wife] is flogged and he must also pay the hundred sela’, but only where he had intercourse with her.  
Judah ruled: 
As to flogging, [the husband is] flogged in all circumstances.
But does R. Judah, hold that “as to flogging, [the husband] is flogged in all circumstance.” 
But has it not been taught: R. Judah says: 
If he had intercourse he is flogged but if he did not have intercourse he is not flogged?
Nahman b. Yitzchak said:
He is flogged with lashes for rebelling against the rabbis.

Daf 46a

Papa said: 
What does it mean “if he had intercourse he is flogged” which was used there.
A monetary fine.
But could one describe a monetary fine as “flogging”?
Yes, and so indeed we have learned:
If a man said, “I vow to pay half of my valuation” he most pay half of his valuation. R. Yose the son of R. Judah ruled:
He is flogged and must pay his full valuation.
Why should he be flogged?
R. Papa explained:
He is “flogged” by [having to pay his] full valuation.
What is the reason? It is a preventive measure against the possibility [of a vow for] the value of half of one’s body, and the value of a half is like an organ that life depends on.
Our rabbis taught:
“And they shall punish him” (Deuteronomy 22:19) this refers to a monetary fine; “And chastise him” (v. 18) this refers to flogging.
It is easy to understand why “And they shall punish him” refers to a monetary payment since it is written, “And they shall punish him a hundred shekels of silver and he shall give them to the father of the young girl” (v. 19). But how do I know that “And chastise him” refers to flogging?
Abbahu said: 
We learn “shall chastise” from “shall chastise,” and “shall chastise” from “son” and “son” from “son”– “Then it shall be, if the wicked man deserves to be flogged” (Deuteronomy 25:2).
From where is the warning against bringing up an evil name [upon one’s wife] deduced?
Elazar said:
From, “Do not go around as a talebearer” (Leviticus 19:16). Nathan said:
From “You shall guard yourself from every evil thing” (Deuteronomy 23:10).
What is the reason that R. Elazar does not say [that the warning comes] from this text?
That text he requires for [the same deduction] as [that made by] R. Pinchas b. Yair:
“And you shall keep yourself from every evil thing”; From here R. Pinchas b. Yair 
said that a person should not have [impure] thoughts in his heart, and thus bring himself to have impurity at night.
What then is the reason why R. Nathan does not make his deduction from this text?   
That text is a warning to the court that it must not be lenient with one [of the litigants] and harsh to the other.
If [a husband] did not tell the witnesses, “Come and testify for me” and they testify on their own, he is not to be lashed nor is he to pay the hundred sela.  
She, however, and the witnesses who testified falsely against her are hurried to the place of stoning.
“She and the false witnesses who testified against her”! 
Rather,
“She or her false witnesses are hurried to the place of stoning.”
The reason is because he did not tell them [to testify]. Had he told them [he would have been subject to the penalties] even though he did not hire them. 
This comes to exclude the view of R. Judah, as it was taught: R. Judah ruled:
 [A husband] incurs no penalties unless he has hired the witnesses.
What is R. Judah’s reason? 
R. Abbahu said: 
 It is drawn from the two appearance of the root “to place” (שימה). 
Here it is written, “And he places false charges against her,” (Deuteronomy 22:14) and elsewhere it is written, “Neither shall you place interest on him” (Exodus 22:24) just as there refers to money so too here it refers to money.
Nahman b. Yitzchak said,and so did R. Joseph the of Sidon teach at the school of R. Shimon b. Yohai: 
It is drawn from the two appearance of the root “to place” (שימה).
Yirmiyah asked:
What is the ruling where [the husband] hired them with a piece of land?
What [if he hired them] for a sum less than a perutah?
What [if both witnesses were hired] for one perutah?
Ashi asked:
What [is the ruling where a husband] brought an evil name [on his wife] in respect of their first marriage? What [if a levir brought up an evil name] in respect of his brother’s marriage?
Solve, in any case, one [of these questions]. For R. Jonah taught: 
“I gave my daughter to this man” but not to the levir.
What [is the ruling of] the rabbis and what [is that of] R. Eliezer b. Jacob?
As it was taught:
What is the bringing up of an evil name [against one’s wife]?
If [a husband] came to the court and said,
 “I, So-and-so, did not find signs of virginity for your daughter.”
 If there are witnesses that she committed adultery after being betrothed to him, he is entitled to a ketubah of a maneh.
If there are witnesses that she committed adultery after being betrothed to him, she is entitled to a ketubah of a maneh! 
She is liable for stoning?
 This is what was meant:
If there are witnesses that she fornicated while she was betrothed, she is to be stoned; if she fornicated before [her marriage] she is entitled to a ketubah of a maneh. 
 If it turns out that the evil name was not an evil name, the husband is flogged and he must also pay a hundred sela, whether he had intercourse [with her] or whether he did not have intercourse [with her].
R. Eliezer b. Ya’akov said:
These things were said only where he had intercourse [with her].
According to R. Eliezer b. Ya’akov one can well understand why Scripture used the expressions, “And he came upon her” and “And I drew near to her”,
but according to the Rabbis, what does it mean “And he came upon her” and “And I drew near to her”?  
“And he came upon her” with accusations and “And I drew near to her”, with words.
According to R. Eliezer b. Jacob one can understand why Scripture used the expression, “I did not find in your daughter the signs of virginity, 
but according to the Rabbis what does it mean, “I did not find in your daughter the signs of virginity.”
I did not find for your daughter witnesses to establish her claim to virginity.
According to R. Eliezer b. Jacob one can understand why Scripture used the expression, “And these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity”; 
but according to the Rabbis what could be the sense of [the expression,] “And these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity”?
And these are the witnesses who testify to my daughter’s virginity.
According to R. Eliezer b. Jacob one can understand why Scripture used the expression, “And they shall spread the garment,” 
but according to the Rabbis what does “And they shall spread the garment” mean? 
Abbahu said:
They explain [the charge] which he submitted against her; 
as it was taught:
“And they shall spread the garment”
teaches that the witnesses of the one party and those of the other party come, and the matter is made as clear as a new garment.
Eliezer b. Jacob said:
The words are to be taken in their literal sense: An actual garment.
Yitzchak son of R. Ya’akov b. Giyori sent this message in the name of R. Yohanan: 
: Although we do not find anywhere in the Torah that Scripture draws a distinction between natural and unnatural intercourse in respect of lashes or other punishments, such a distinction was made in the case of a man who brought an evil name [upon his wife]; 
for he is not liable unless he has intercourse with her, [even] in an unnatural manner, he brought up an evil name upon her in respect of a natural intercourse.
In accordance with whose view?
If in accordance with the view of the Rabbis [the husband should have been held guilty] even if he did not have intercourse with her. If in accordance with the view of R. Eliezer b. Ya’akov, 

Daf 46b

both cases are in a natural manner?
Rather, R. Kahana sent in the name of R. Yohanan:
He is not guilty unless he had intercourse in a natural manner and he brought up an evil name upon her in respect of a natural intercourse.
A father has authority over his daughter in her betrothal [whether it was effected] by money, document or intercourse.
He is entitled to anything she finds, to her handiwork and to annul her vows. He receives her get but he has no usufruct [from her property] during her lifetime.
When she marries, the husband surpasses him [in his rights] in that he has usufruct during her lifetime. And he is obligated to feed her, to pay a ransom for her and to provide for her burial. 
Rabbi Judah says: 
even the poorest man in Israel must provide no less than two flutes and one lamenting woman.
GEMARA. “By money.” From where is this deduced?
Rav Judah replied:
Scripture said, “Then she shall go out for nothing, without money” (Exodus 21:11), [which implies that] this master receives no money but that another master does receive money; And who is he? Her father.
But might it not be suggested that it belongs to her?
Now that her father who contracts her betrothal, as it is written in Scripture, “I gave my daughter to this man,” (Deuteronomy 22:16) would she take the money!
But might it not be suggested that
this applies only to a minor who has no legal right [to betroth herself], but a na’arah who has such rights may herself contract her betrothal, and she herself receives the money?
Scripture stated, “Being in her youth in her father’s house” (Numbers 30:17), [implying that] all the advantages of her youth belong to her father.
But what about that which R. Huna said in the name of Rav:
From where do we know that a daughter’s handiwork belongs to her father? As it is said, “And if a man sells his daughter to be a maidservant” (Exodus 21:7): just as the handiwork of a maidservant belongs to her master so does the handiwork of a daughter belong to her father.
Now why do I need this verse, deduce it from “Being in her youth in her father’s house”?
Rather,
that verse was written in connection only with the annulment of vows?  
And should you suggest that
we might infer this from it, monetary matters cannot be inferred from ritual matters.
And should you suggest that 
it might be inferred from [the laws of compensation for] shame and blemish, shame and blemish are different, since the father is also involved in it?
Rather, it is logical that when the Torah excluded [one “going out”] it excluded a “going out” that was similar.
But this “going out,” is not like that of the other: For in the case of the master [the maidservant] goes entirely out of his control while in the “going out” from the control of her father she still needs to be brought into the huppah?
In respect of the annulment of vows, at any rate, she goes out of his control;
for we have learned:
In the case of a betrothed na’arah, the father and her husband jointly annul her vows.
Document or intercourse:
From where do we know this? 
 Scripture said, 
“And becomes another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2) all of the ways in which a woman becomes a wife are compared one to the other.
He receives the lost objects she finds:


Daf 47a

Because of enmity.
 To her handiwork.
From where do we know this?
R. Huna said in the name of Rav:
From where do we know that a daughter’s handiwork belongs to her father?
As it is said, “And if a man sells his daughter to be a maidservant” (Exodus 21:7): just as the handiwork of a maidservant belongs to her master so does the handiwork of a daughter belong to her father.
But say that
this [applies only to] a minor whom he may sell, but the handiwork of a na’arah  whom he cannot sell belongs to herself?
It is but logical that it should belong to her father, for should you think that her handiwork does not belong to her father, how could the Torah confer upon the father the right to send his daughter to the huppah: How could he send her? 
This would prevent her from doing her work?
Ahai raised an objection:
Say that he pays her compensation [for the time] she is taken away [from her work]?
Alternatively,
he could send her at night?
Alternatively,
he could send her on a Sabbath or festival?
Rather, a minor does not need a verse.
Now that he may sell her was it at all necessary [to state that her handiwork belongs to him]?
Rather, the verse is needed in reference to a na’arah.
To annul her vows. 
From where do we know this? 
As it is written, “Being in her youth in her father’s house.”
And he receives her bill of divorce.
From where do we know this?
— As it is written, “And she goes out and becomes” (Deuteronomy 24:2), her going out is compared to her becoming.
But he has no usufruct during her lifetime. Our Rabbis taught:
A father has no rights to usufruct during the lifetime of his daughter.
R. Yose the son of R. Judah ruled:
A father does have rights to usufruct in the lifetime of his daughter.
On what principle do they differ?
The first tanna holds that 
the rabbis were well justified in allowing enacting that the usufruct belongs to a husband, since otherwise he might refrain from ransoming [his wife].  But with regard to the father, what is there to say? That he would refrain from ransoming her?
[It is certain that] he would ransom her in any case.
Yose the son of R. Judah holds that 
a father also might refrain from ransoming [his daughter], 
for he might think:
She is carrying a purse on her, let her go and ransom herself.
When she marries, the husband surpasses him [in his rights] in that he has usufruct etc.
Our Rabbis taught:
If [a father] promised his daughter in writing fruit, clothes or other movable objects that she would take with her from her father’s house to that of her husband, 
and she died, her husband does not acquire these objects.
In the name of R. Natan it was stated: 
The husband does acquire them.
Shall we say that they differ on the same principles as those on which R. Elazar b. Azariah and the Rabbis differed?
For we learned:
If she was widowed or divorced, either after betrothal or after marriage, she is entitled to collect the entire amount. 
Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah says:
[a woman widowed or divorced] after marriage receives the entire amount; After betrothal [but before marriage], a virgin collects two hundred zuz and a widow only one maneh,

Daf 47b

for the man wrote her [the additional amount] in order to marry her.
The one who says that he does not acquire [that which her father wrote] is like R. Elazar b. Azaryah, and the one who says that he has acquired, is like the rabbis.
No; all hold like R. Elazar b. Azaryah.
 He who said that he does not acquire [is obviously] in agreement with R. Elazar b. Azaryah.  And he who said that he does acquire, it might be said that R. Elazar b. Azaryah was referring only to commitments from him to her, for the man wrote her [the additional amount] in order to marry her.
But with regard to that which goes from her to him, even R. Elazar b. Azaryah may admit [that betrothal has the same force as marriage] since [these were promised] due to [a desire for] matrimonial association, and such association, surely, had taken place. 
He provides for his wife’s maintenance:
Our Rabbis taught:
They established that he provides maintenance in return for receiving her handiwork, and he is responsible for her burial in return for receiving her ketubah [dowry],
and therefore the husband receives the usufruct.
Usufruct! Who mentioned it?
A clause is missing, and this is how it should read:
They established that he provides maintenance in return for receiving her handiwork, and he is responsible for redeeming her in return for receiving the usufruct, and for burying her in return for her ketubah [dowry],
and therefore the husband receives the usufruct.
What does “therefore” mean?
What might you have said?
[That a husband] must not consume the usufruct but should rather leave it, since otherwise, he might refrain from ransoming her, thus it teaches us that that  was preferable, for sometimes [the proceeds of the usufruct] might not suffice and he would have to ransom her at his own expense.
But why should I not reverse the correlation?
Abaye aid:
They established the common for the common and the uncommon for the uncommon.
Rava said:
The following Tanna holds that maintenance is obligatory on the husband from the Torah. For it was taught:
“She’erah” refers to maintenance, for so it is said in Scripture, “Who also eat the she’er (flesh) of my people” Micah 3:3;
“Kesutah” [is to be understood] according to its ordinary meaning [as clothing];
“Onatah” refers to the time for conjugal duty prescribed in the Torah, for so it is said in Scripture, “If you withhold conjugal duty (te’aneh) from my daughters” (Genesis 31:50).
Elazar said:
“She’arah refers to the prescribed time for conjugal duty, for so it is said, “None of you shall approach to anyone that is near of kin (she’er) to uncover their nakedness” (Leviticus 18:6);
“Kesutah” [is to be understood] according to its ordinary meaning [as clothing];
“Onatah” refers to maintenance, for so it is said, “And he afflicted you, and caused you to be ravenous” (Deuteronomy 8:3).

Daf 48a

Eliezer b. Ya’akov says:
“She’erah kesutah:” Provide her with clothing according to her age,
that he should not provide his old wife [with the clothing] of a young one nor his young wife with that of an old one.
“Kesutah Ve-Onatah:” Provide her with clothing according to the season of the year, that he should not give her new clothing in the summer nor worn out clothing in the winter.
Joseph taught:
“Her flesh” implies close bodily contact, that he should not treat her in the manner of the Persians who have sexual relations with their clothes on.
This provides support for [a ruling of] R. Huna
who said that a husband who says, “I will not [have sex with my wife] unless she wears her clothes and I mine,” he must divorce her and also her kethubah.
Judah ruled:
even the poorest man in Israel etc.
This then implies that the first Tanna is of the opinion that these are not [necessary].
But how is one to imagine [the case]?
If it was her customs, why would the first opinion say he is not liable?
And if it is not her custom, then what is R. Judah’s reasoning?
 [The ruling was] necessary only [in a case], for instance, where this was her custom but not his.
The first Tanna is of the opinion that 
the principle that she rises with him but does not go down with him is applied only during her lifetime but not after her death,
while R. Judah maintains [that the principle applies]
even after her death.
Hisda said in the name of Mar Ukba:
The halakhah is in agreement with R. Judah.
Hisda further stated in the name of Mar Ukba:
If a man became insane the court takes possession of his estate and provides food and clothing for his wife, sons and daughters, and something else.
Ravina said to R. Ashi:
Why should this be different from that concerning which it was taught:
If a man went to a country beyond the sea and his wife demanded maintenance, the court takes possession of his estate and provides food and clothing for his wife, but not for his sons and daughters or for something else?
The other replied:
Do you not draw a distinction between one who departs intentionally and one who departs unintentionally?
What [is meant by] “something else”?
Hisda said: This refers to cosmetics.
Joseph said: 
Charity.
The one who said, “cosmetics,” all the more so charity. But the one who said, “charity” would say that he does give her cosmetics, for he would not want her to be disgraced.
Hiyya b. Avin said in the name of R. Huna: 
If a man went to a country beyond the sea, and his wife died, the court takes possession of his estate and buries her in a manner befitting his status.
“In a manner befitting his status,” but not her status!  
Say:
Even in a manner befitting his status; 
and it is this that he teaches us:
She goes up with him [to  his status] but does not go down with him [to a lower status] even after her death.
Matana said:
A man who said that when [his wife] died she shall not be buried at the expense of his estate must be obeyed.
Why should it be different if he has left instructions? Obviously because the estate falls to the orphans; but the estate falls to the orphans even if he left no instructions?
Rather [it should read]: One who said that when he dies he should not be buried at the expense of his estate is not to be obeyed, for it is not within his power to enrich his sons and throw himself upon the public.
She remains in the domain of her father until she enters

Daf 48b

the domain of her husband [by going into the bridal chamber] at marriage.
If her father delivered her to the agents of the husband she passes into the domain of her husband.
If her father went with the husband’s agents or if the father’s agents went with the husband’s agents she remains in the domain of her father.
If her father’s agents delivered her to the husband’s agents she passes into the domain of her husband.
GEMARA. What [is the purport of] “she remains”?
To exclude [the ruling] of an earlier mishnah
where we taught:
If the time [for marriage] came and they were not married they are maintained out of the husband’s estate and [if he is a priest] they may eat terumah.  
Therefore it teaches us
 “she remains.”
