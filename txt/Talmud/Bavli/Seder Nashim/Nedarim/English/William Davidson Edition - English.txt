Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> When an individual takes a vow, he renders an object forbidden to himself or to others as though it were a sacrificial offering; this parallels the act of consecrating an offering, which also renders an item forbidden for personal use by means of a verbal declaration. The most direct expression of a vow is when an individual says: This object is forbidden to me, or to others, like an offering. Additionally, the mishna states that <span class="gemarra-regular">all substitutes </span>for the language <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">are like </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vows</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Consequently, if one states that an object is forbidden to him like a <span class="it-text">konam</span> instead of like an offering [<span class="it-text">korban</span>], the vow takes effect, as <span class="it-text">konam</span> is a substitute term for the word <span class="it-text">korban</span> (see 10a).
Similarly, substitutes for the language of <span class="gemarra-regular">dedications are like dedications</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> substitutes for the language of <span class="gemarra-regular">oaths are like oaths</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>substitutes for the language of <span class="gemarra-regular">nazirite </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">are like nazirite </span>vows. Therefore, if one declared a <span class="it-text">ḥerekh</span> instead of a dedication [<span class="it-text">ḥerem</span>], a <span class="it-text">shevuta</span> instead of an oath [<span class="it-text">shevua</span>], or proclaimed that he was becoming a <span class="it-text">nazik</span> instead of a nazirite [<span class="it-text">nazir</span>], his statement takes effect.
With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to another: I am avowed from you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am separated from you, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am distanced from you, </span>and he then says: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eat </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I taste </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours, </span>even though he did not explicitly state that he is taking a vow or specify the nature of the vow, the object of his vow is nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden. </span>His intention is understood based on his incomplete statement, known as an intimation of a vow, and his vow therefore takes effect.
However, if he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am ostracized from you, </span>which does not clearly declare any matter to be prohibited, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva was uncertai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> about this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> but was inclined <span class="gemarra-regular">to rule stringently about this </span>and consider it a vow prohibiting the speaker from deriving benefit from his fellow. 

Daf 2b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It was taught in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">all substitutes </span>for the language <span class="gemarra-regular">of vows are like vows, </span>substitutes for the language of dedications are like dedications, substitutes for the language of oaths are like oaths, and substitutes for the language of nazirite vows are like nazirite vows. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different with regard to </span>the first mishna of tractate <span class="gemarra-italic">Nazir</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that it does not teach all of them, </span>i.e., all of the cases listed above besides nazirite vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what is different with regard to </span>the first mishna of tractate <span class="gemarra-italic">Nedarim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that it teaches all of them </span>and not merely the case of vows, which is the subject directly relevant to this tractate?
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">vows and oaths are written next to each other </span>in the Torah in the verse: “When a man takes a vow to the Lord, or swears an oath” (Numbers 30:3), the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>cases, i.e., substitutes for the language of vows and oaths. <span class="gemarra-regular">And since it taught two </span>of the cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">it taught all of them. </span>
The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let</span> the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">substitutes </span>for the language <span class="gemarra-regular">of oaths </span>immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">after </span>the case of substitutes for the language of <span class="gemarra-regular">vows. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since it taught </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">vows,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whereby an object becomes forbidden to one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">taught also </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">dedications, whereby an object becomes forbidden to one. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">to the exclusion of an oath, </span>whereby <span class="gemarra-regular">one prohibits himself from </span>making use of <span class="gemarra-regular">an object. </span>In the case of an oath, unlike a vow or a dedication, one prohibits himself from performing a particular action rather than declaring an object to be forbidden. 
§ The Gemara asks a question with regard to the style of the mishna: The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">began with </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">substitutes </span>when it stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">All substitutes </span>for the language <span class="gemarra-regular">of vows </span>are like vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it then immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">explains </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">intimation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of vows, as the next line addresses a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to his fellow: I am avowed from you. And furthermore, </span>did the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">forget </span>to mention <span class="gemarra-regular">intimations </span>of vows? Why doesn’t the mishna state that intimations of vows are considered vows before it gives examples of intimations?
The Gemara answers: The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is dealing with them, </span>i.e., intimations of vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the text of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete and is teaching the following</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">All substitutes </span>for the language <span class="gemarra-regular">of vows are like vows, and intimations of vows are like vows. </span>The mishna then continues by giving examples of intimations of vows. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">explain </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">substitutes </span>for the language of vows <span class="gemarra-regular">first, </span>i.e., before it gives examples of intimations, just as the basic <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of substitutes for the language of vows was mentioned first. In fact, it is not until later (10a) that the mishna provides examples of substitutes for the language of vows.
The Gemara answers: The general style of the Mishna is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>subject <span class="gemarra-regular">with which it concludes is the one that it explains first, as </span>in that which <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shabbat</span> 20b): <span class="gemarra-regular">With what may one light </span>the Shabbat lamp <span class="gemarra-regular">and with what may one not light </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not light </span>with cedar bast, <span class="gemarra-regular">etc.</span> The mishna provides examples of items one may not use to light the Shabbat lamp, which was the concluding phrase of the mishna’s introductory question, rather than beginning with examples of what one may use to light the Shabbat lamp. 
Similarly, another mishna (<span class="it-text">Shabbat</span> 47b) states: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what may one insulate </span>a pot of cooked food on Shabbat eve, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in what may one not insulate </span>it? <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not insulate </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">etc. </span>A third example of this style is in the following mishna (<span class="it-text">Shabbat</span> 57a): <span class="gemarra-regular">With what </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">may a woman go out </span>into the public domain on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">and with what </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">may she not go out? A woman may not go out </span>with strings of wool and other adornments that she may take off and carry.
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is it true that <span class="gemarra-regular">wherever it begins, </span>i.e., whichever topic the mishna mentions first, <span class="gemarra-regular">it does not explain first? But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Batra</span> 108a): <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>some relatives who <span class="gemarra-regular">inherit and bequeath, </span>e.g., a father and a son, who inherit property from each other, and there are those who <span class="gemarra-regular">inherit but do not bequeath, </span>e.g., a son and his mother; <span class="gemarra-regular">and these </span>are the ones who <span class="gemarra-regular">inherit and bequeath, </span>etc. This mishna provides examples of the opening line of the introductory statement before providing examples of the concluding line of the introductory statement. 
Similarly, another mishna (<span class="it-text">Yevamot</span> 84a) states: <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>some women who are <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to their husbands and forbidden to their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yevamin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., their husband’s brothers if their husbands die childless. These cases include one where the <span class="it-text">yavam</span> is the High Priest, who is prohibited from marrying a widow. There are other women who are <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yevamin</span> if their husbands die childless <span class="gemarra-regular">but forbidden to their husbands, </span>e.g., if a High Priest betrothed a widow and his brother is a common priest. The mishna immediately provides the details of the first principle: <span class="gemarra-regular">And these are </span>the women who are <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to their husbands and forbidden to their </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yevamin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
Similarly, another mishna (<span class="it-text">Menaḥot</span> 59a) states with regard to meal-offerings: <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>some meal-offerings that <span class="gemarra-regular">require oil and frankincense </span>and some that require <span class="gemarra-regular">oil but not frankincense. </span>The mishna continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And these </span>are the ones that <span class="gemarra-regular">require oil and frankincense. </span>Yet another mishna (<span class="it-text">Menaḥot</span> 60a) states: <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>meal-offerings that <span class="gemarra-regular">require bringing near, </span>a ritual where the priests were required to carry the offering in their hands and bring it near the altar, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">do not require waving; </span>other meal-offerings require <span class="gemarra-regular">waving but not bringing near. And these </span>are the meal-offerings that <span class="gemarra-regular">require bringing near.</span>
Another mishna (<span class="it-text">Bekhorot</span> 46a) states: <span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>some who are considered a <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn with regard to </span>receiving a double portion of <span class="gemarra-regular">inheritance, </span>as they are the firstborn of their fathers, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>considered a <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn with regard to a priest, </span>i.e., with regard to the mitzva of redemption of the firstborn, which applies only to a woman’s firstborn son. There are others who are considered a <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn with regard to a priest and are not </span>considered a <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn with regard to inheritance. And who is </span>considered a <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn with regard to inheritance </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">not a firstborn with regard to a priest? </span>In each of these five cases, the mishna first explains the opening portion of its introductory statement and only then explains the second part of its introductory statement.
The Gemara explains: In <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">because there are many [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">avshu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> categories, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">explains </span>the statement with <span class="gemarra-regular">which it began first. </span>However, when there are only two categories, the mishna first provides detail for the latter part of its opening statement.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t </span>the mishna (<span class="it-text">Shabbat</span> 51b) state: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what may an animal go out </span>into the public domain on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">and with what may it not go out? </span>This is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">that does not have many </span>categories, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: A camel may go out </span>on Shabbat with an <span class="it-text">afsar</span>, etc., which clarifies the opening portion of the mishna’s introductory statement. 

Daf 3a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">not particular </span>with regard to this matter, and there is no consistent pattern. <span class="gemarra-regular">Sometimes it explains first that </span>subject with which <span class="gemarra-regular">it began, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">sometimes it explains first that </span>subject <span class="gemarra-regular">with which </span>the introductory line in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">finished. And if you wish, say </span>an alternate explanation of the order of the mishna here: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">intimations, since they are derived from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">exposition </span>of verses and are not explicitly mentioned in the Torah, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> cherishes them and <span class="gemarra-regular">explains them first. </span>
The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him begin </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">with that, </span>i.e., intimations, <span class="gemarra-regular">first. </span>The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">begins with substitutes </span>for the language of vows, which are written <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Torah, in the first clause, and then explains intimations, which are derived from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">exposition </span>of verses. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This works out well according to the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">substitutes </span>for the language of vows <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>terms for vows in a <span class="gemarra-regular">foreign language. </span>Consequently, they may be considered to have been written in the Torah, as vows are certainly valid regardless of the language in which they are expressed. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to the one who says </span>that these substitute terms are simply <span class="gemarra-regular">language that the Sages invented </span>for one <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>use in taking a <span class="gemarra-regular">vow </span>so as to minimize using God’s name in expressing a vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">what can be said? </span>These include novelties just as intimations do. 
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does </span>the mishna explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">intimations </span>of vows? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you not consider it incomplete, </span>missing the phrase that mentions intimations? Once you are inserting this phrase into the mishna, you can <span class="gemarra-regular">also</span> have it <span class="gemarra-regular">precede </span>the clause about substitutes for the language of vows <span class="gemarra-regular">and teach </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">intimations </span>at the beginning, so that the mishna reads as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">All intimations of vows are like vows, and all substitutes </span>for the language <span class="gemarra-regular">of vows are like vows. And these are intimations: One who says to his fellow: </span>I am avowed from you, etc. <span class="gemarra-regular">And these are substitutes </span>for the language of vows: <span class="gemarra-italic">Konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ Apropos the discussion of intimations of vows, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And where are intimations </span>of vows <span class="gemarra-regular">written, </span>i.e., from where in the Torah is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of intimations of vows derived? The Gemara explains that it is from the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“When a man </span>or a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a nazirite [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nazir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], to consecrate [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lehazir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] himself to the Lord” </span>(Numbers 6:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the doubled term <span class="gemarra-regular">“</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nazir</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lehazir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to render substitutes </span>for the language <span class="gemarra-regular">of nazirite </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">like nazirite </span>vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">and intimations of nazirite </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">like nazirite </span>vows.
<span class="gemarra-regular">I have </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>intimations of <span class="gemarra-regular">nazirite </span>vows; <span class="gemarra-regular">from where </span>do I derive intimations of general <span class="gemarra-regular">vows? The verse states: “When a man </span>or woman <span class="gemarra-regular">shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a nazirite, to consecrate himself to the Lord.” </span>This verse <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposes nazirite </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">vows and </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">vows to nazirite </span>vows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">nazirite </span>vows, the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered intimations of nazirite </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">like nazirite </span>vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">vows, it rendered intimations of vows like vows.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">vows, </span>one who breaks his vow <span class="gemarra-regular">transgresses </span>the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">He shall not profane </span>(see Numbers 30:3), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>if he does not fulfill his vow in time, he transgresses the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">You shall not delay </span>(see Deuteronomy 23:22), <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">nazirite </span>vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">he transgresses </span>the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">He shall not profane,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">You shall not delay. And </span>furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">vows, a father may nullify the vows of his daughte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a husband may nullify the vows of his wife, </span>as written explicitly in the passage concerning vows (Numbers, chapter 30), <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">nazirite </span>vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">a father may nullif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the nazirite </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">of his daughter and a husband may nullify the nazirite </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">of his wife.</span>
The Gemara questions this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different with regard to nazirite </span>vows, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">which it is written “</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nazir</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lehazir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,” </span>using the doubled term, when with regard to all <span class="gemarra-regular">vows as well it is written: “To utter a vow [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lindor</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">neder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>also using a doubled term? <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">the juxtaposition </span>of all other vows to nazirite vows in order to derive that intimations of vows are like vows, when this can be derived from the doubled term with regard to general vows?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">had written: A vow to utter [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">neder</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lindor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], as it wrote </span>with regard to a nazirite: “The vow of <span class="gemarra-regular">a nazirite, to consecrate himself [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nazir</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lehazir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>it would be <span class="gemarra-regular">as you said, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>would be <span class="gemarra-regular">no need for the juxtaposition. Now that it is written: “To utter a vow [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lindor</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">neder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],”</span> it is possible to say that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah spoke in the language of men, </span>and nothing can be derived from the phrase <span class="it-text">lindor</span> <span class="it-text">neder</span>, which is simply a common manner of speech.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This works out well according to the one who holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah spoke in the language of men, but according to the one who does not hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah spoke in the language of men, </span>any doubled term comes to teach something. <span class="gemarra-regular">What does he do with this </span>phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“To utter a vow [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lindor</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">neder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]”? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He expounds it to render intimations of vows like vows </span>themselves. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposes nazirite </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">vows </span>to teach that intimations of vows are like vows with regard to nazirite vows, and to teach the other <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> mentioned above. With regard to the phrase: “The vow of <span class="gemarra-regular">a nazirite, to consecrate himself [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nazir</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lehazir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” he expounds: </span>This <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches</span>

Daf 3b

<span class="gemarra-regular">that a </span>term of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship takes effect upon a </span>previously accepted term of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship. </span>Consequently, if one became a nazirite and then again declared: I am hereby a nazirite, then when his term of naziriteship is completed he must observe a second term of naziriteship.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the one who says that the Torah spoke in the language of men </span>and therefore nothing can be derived from the phrase “to utter a vow [<span class="it-text">lindor</span> <span class="it-text">neder</span>],” <span class="gemarra-regular">and he expounds </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“the vow of a nazirite to consecrate himself [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nazir</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lehazir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” to render intimations of nazirite </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">like nazirite </span>vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where does he </span>derive that a term of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship takes effect upon a </span>previously accepted term of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship? This works out well if he holds in accordance with the one who says </span>that a term of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship does not take effect upon a </span>previously accepted term of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship; however, if he holds in accordance with the one who says </span>that a term of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship takes effect upon a </span>previously accepted term of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship, from where does he </span>derive this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let the verse say: To consecrate himself [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lizor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What </span>is the reason the verse expressed this same idea with the word <span class="gemarra-italic">lehazir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Learn two </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from this: </span>That intimations of nazirite vows are considered nazirite vows, and that a term of naziriteship takes effect upon a previously accepted term of naziriteship.
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">In the West</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Eretz Yisrael, they <span class="gemarra-regular">say: There is a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who derives intimations </span>of vows <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“to utter a vow [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lindor</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">neder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>as he holds that the Torah did not speak in the language of men. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who </span>holds that the Torah spoke in the language of men, and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">derives this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> of intimations <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth” </span>(Numbers 30:3). The inclusive formulation of this verse comes to include intimations of vows. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited earlier: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">vows, one </span>who breaks his vow <span class="gemarra-regular">transgresses </span>the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">He shall not profane, and</span> one who does not fulfill his vow in time transgresses the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">You shall not delay, </span>so too, the same is true with regard to nazirite vows. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, you </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">find </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one transgresses the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">He shall not profane, in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">vows. For example, where one said: I will eat this loaf, and he does not eat it, he violates </span>the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">He shall not profane his word. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to transgressing the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">He shall not profane, in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">nazirite </span>vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">how can you find these </span>circumstances? <span class="gemarra-regular">Once he said: I am hereby a nazirite, he is a nazirite </span>as of that moment. If he then <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>grapes, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is liable for </span>violating the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">He shall not eat </span>(see Numbers 6:4), and if he <span class="gemarra-regular">drank </span>wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is liable for </span>violating the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">He shall not drink </span>(see Numbers 6:3). When would he ever become liable for violating the prohibition against profanation? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The prohibition against profanation serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to render him liable for </span>violating <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>prohibitions. Consequently, if he eats grapes or drinks wine, he transgresses the relevant prohibition in addition to the prohibition against profanation.
The Gemara further asks: With regard to violating the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">You shall not delay, in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">nazirite </span>vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">how can you find these </span>circumstances? <span class="gemarra-regular">Once he said: I am hereby a nazirite, he is a nazirite</span> as of that moment. If he then <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>grapes, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is liable for </span>violating the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">He shall not eat. </span>When would he ever become liable for violating the prohibition against delaying? The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">when he </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I will become a nazirite when I wish, </span>in which case he does not become a nazirite immediately. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he said: When I wish, there is no </span>prohibition of: <span class="gemarra-regular">You shall not delay, </span>as there is no particular time by which he must become a nazirite.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>It is, <span class="gemarra-regular">for example, when he said: I will not depart the worl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until I become a nazirite, as he is a nazirite</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from that tim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> because he does not know when he will depart this world. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">just as it is </span>in the case of a man <span class="gemarra-regular">who says to his wife: This is your bill of divorce </span>that will take effect <span class="gemarra-regular">one hou</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> before my death. </span>If he is a priest and she is the daughter of a non-priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">she is prohibited from partaking of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">terum</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately. Apparently, we say every moment </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he is </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">dead </span>and she is therefore already divorced. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, too, </span>with regard to naziriteship, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is a nazirite immediately, as we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he is now </span>about to <span class="gemarra-regular">die. </span>

Daf 4a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: </span>The prohibition against delaying applies to a nazirite in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one vowed </span>to become a nazirite <span class="gemarra-regular">while he was in a cemetery</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since it is prohibited for a nazirite to be in a cemetery, his term of naziriteship does not come into effect until he leaves the cemetery and ritually purifies himself. If he delays this process, he prevents the vow from taking effect and thereby transgresses the prohibition against delaying.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This works out well according to the one who says </span>that if one takes a vow of naziriteship while in a cemetery <span class="gemarra-regular">the naziriteship does not apply to him immediately. However, according to the one who said </span>that the naziriteship <span class="gemarra-regular">applies to him immediately</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is there a </span>violation of the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">You shall not delay? And furthermore, didn’t Mar bar Rav Ashi say </span>that all agree that the <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship applies to him immediately </span>and he need not repeat his vow of naziriteship when he leaves, <span class="gemarra-regular">and when they disagree </span>it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the matter of flogging, </span>and it’s only about this that they <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., whether the nazirite is flogged if he drinks wine or otherwise violates the prohibitions of a nazirite. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even so, he is liable for </span>violating the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">You shall not delay</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because </span>by remaining in the cemetery <span class="gemarra-regular">he delays a naziriteship of ritual purity. </span>Although the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of naziriteship take effect upon him immediately, he is still obligated to fulfill a term of naziriteship in a state of ritual purity, and if he delays doing so, he violates the prohibition against delaying. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Since this is so, a nazirite who intentionally renders himself ritually impur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> violates </span>the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">You shall not delay, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a naziriteship of ritual purity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as he thereby prevents himself from completing his naziriteship in a state of ritual purity on time.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, stated </span>another explanation of how the prohibition against delaying applies with regard to naziriteship: The nazirite is commanded to shave his hair at the conclusion of his term, and if he causes this shaving to be delayed, <span class="gemarra-regular">he violates </span>the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">You shall not delay, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">his shaving</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to say, i.e., it is obvious, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">shaving is indispensable </span>for a nazirite and he is subject to all the prohibitions of a nazirite until he shaves, <span class="gemarra-regular">but even according to the one who says</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">shaving is not indispensabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of naziriteship are terminated for him immediately after he brings his offerings, <span class="gemarra-regular">at least </span>it can be said that <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not fulfill the mitzva of shaving </span>until he actually shaves, and therefore if he delays, he violates the prohibition against delaying. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari, stated </span>another explanation of how the prohibition against delaying applies to a nazirite vow: <span class="gemarra-regular">He transgresses </span>the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">You shall not delay, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">his offerings. </span>When he completes his term as a nazirite he is obligated to bring certain offerings, and if he delays bringing them, he violates this prohibition. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span>, that the prohibition against delaying applies to a nazirite vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">derived from here, </span>i.e., the juxtaposition of vows and naziriteship? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is derived from there, </span>a different exposition based upon the verse: “When you shall take a vow…you shall not delay to pay it; for the Lord your God <span class="gemarra-regular">will surely require it </span>of you” (Deuteronomy 23:22). <span class="gemarra-regular">Those </span>items included in the phrase “will surely require it” <span class="gemarra-regular">are sin-offerings and guilt-offerings, </span>including the sin-offering and guilt-offering of a nazirite. 
The Gemara explains: The derivation based on the juxtaposition of vows and naziriteship is still necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say that </span>these offerings are <span class="gemarra-regular">a novelty that the Torah innovated with regard to a nazirite </span>and therefore their <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> cannot be derived from <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of other offerings. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the novelty </span>that the Torah introduced with regard to the nazirite? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">that he cannot accept </span>upon <span class="gemarra-regular">himself the sin-offering of a nazirite through a vow, </span>i.e., if one who is not a nazirite says: I hereby vow to bring the sin-offering of a nazirite, his vow has no validity, this is not a unique <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to sin-offerings of a nazirite. There is also the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the sin-offering of forbidden fat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a typical sin-offering that one brings when he inadvertently violates certain prohibitions, one of which is eating forbidden fat, <span class="gemarra-regular">which one cannot accept through a vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as only one who has violated the prohibition may bring it; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">transgresses </span>the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">You shall not delay, </span>if he delays bringing the offering.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what is its novelty </span>that makes the juxtaposition between vows and naziriteship necessary? It might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since if he said: I am hereby a nazirite, even </span>if he accepted upon himself only one of the prohibitions of a nazirite, e.g., the requirement to abstain <span class="gemarra-regular">from grape seeds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he is </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">a nazirite with regard to all </span>aspects of naziriteship, therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not transgress </span>the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">You shall not delay. </span>Since this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is a novelty, perhaps the principles of vows do not apply. The verse therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>through the juxtaposition of vows and naziriteship that the prohibition against delaying applies even in this case. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This works out well according to the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>one vows to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a nazirite from grape seeds he is a nazirite in all </span>respects. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is not a nazirite unless he </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">vows to be a nazirite in all </span>respects, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say? And furthermore, this novelty is stringent </span>in that it renders the individual a nazirite even if he did not explicitly accept all of the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of naziriteship. How could this novelty indicate that the prohibition against delaying does not apply in this case, which is a leniency, so that the juxtaposition would be necessary? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what is its novelty </span>that makes the juxtaposition between vows and naziriteship necessary? It might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since</span>

Daf 4b

<span class="gemarra-regular">if he shaves upon </span>bringing <span class="gemarra-regular">one of the thre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> offerings that a nazirite must bring when completing his term as a nazirite, i.e., a burnt-offering, a sin-offering, and a peace-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has fulfilled </span>his obligation to shave and the restrictions of a nazirite are lifted, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">does not violate </span>the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">You shall not delay, </span>for delaying the other offerings. Consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches us </span>that the prohibition against delaying applies to these offerings.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish say: What is the novelty </span>of the nazirite? The <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of naziriteship is considered a novelty <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the offerings of a nazirite <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot be accepted through a vow. And that which </span>poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty for you </span>based on the fact that one cannot accept upon himself <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering of forbidden fat </span>through a vow either, and nevertheless the prohibition against delaying applies, can be resolved. <span class="gemarra-regular">A sin-offering of forbidden fat comes for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement, </span>and therefore if one delays bringing it he violates the prohibition against delaying. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">for what does the sin-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a nazirite come</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Since it does not come to atone for a sin, one might have thought that the prohibition against delaying does not apply.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>there is the precedent of <span class="gemarra-regular">the sin-offering of a woman who gave birth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">does not come for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">atonement</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>yet if she does not bring the offering on time she still <span class="gemarra-regular">transgresses due to </span>the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">You shall not delay. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>sin-offering of a woman who gave birth <span class="gemarra-regular">permits </span>the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat consecrated food</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Although it does not come to effect atonement, it does come to permit a matter. On the other hand, the sin-offering of a nazirite does not permit anything, and therefore the fact that one cannot accept upon himself an obligation to bring this offering is a novelty. Consequently, it was necessary for there to be a separate source to indicate that one is liable for violating the prohibition against delaying in the case of this offering. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited above: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">vows, a father may nullify the vows of his daughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a husband may nullify the vows of his wife, so too, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">nazirite </span>vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">a father may nullify the nazirite </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">of his daughter and a husband may nullify the nazirite </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">of his wife. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">the juxtaposition </span>in the verse to teach us this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">come through </span>the method of analogy known as: <span class="gemarra-regular">What do we find, from </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">vows. </span>In other words, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case of regular vows should serve as a legal precedent that can be applied to nazirite vows even without a biblical juxtaposition.
The Gemara responds: If not for the juxtaposition, one might have said that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to vows that he may nullify </span>her statements <span class="gemarra-regular">because there is no </span>time <span class="gemarra-regular">limit </span>with regard to vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to naziriteship, which has a </span>time <span class="gemarra-regular">limit, as unspecified naziriteship is </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty days</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> one might <span class="gemarra-regular">say no, </span>he may not nullify her vows. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">it teaches us </span>through juxtaposition that he may nevertheless nullify her vows. 
§ It is taught in the mishna with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to his fellow: I am avowed </span>from you, or another intimation of a vow, that the vow takes effect. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: In all </span>these cases, the vow does not take effect <span class="gemarra-regular">until he says: </span>I am avowed from you with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I eat </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I taste </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours. </span>Without this addition, the statement: I am avowed from you, is not considered even an intimation of a vow. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>based on the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am avowed from you, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am separated from you, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am distanced from you, he is prohibited </span>from benefiting from that individual. If he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I eat </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I taste </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours, he is prohibited </span>from eating or tasting that individual’s food. This indicates that the phrases mentioned in the first clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> take effect as vows even if he does not add the phrases mentioned in the latter clause. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said </span>i.e., if one says: I am avowed from you, or the like, the vow takes effect? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I eat </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I taste </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">the opposite </span>order? If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I eat </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I taste </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours, he is prohibited </span>from eating or tasting that individual’s food, i.e., the vow takes effect. If he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am avowed from you, or: I am separated from you, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am distanced from you, he is </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. </span>In this case, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cannot be interpreted as explained above, and it appears that if one said: I am avowed from you, the vow takes effect even if he did not say: I am avowed from you with regard to that which I taste of yours. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Teach </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as follows: </span>The vow takes effect in the cases mentioned in the first clause when <span class="gemarra-regular">he already said: I am avowed. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, this is </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="it-text">barait</span><span class="it-text">a</span> cited above. <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>if the vow takes effect only if he combined the statements mentioned in the first and latter clauses of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">why does </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>in the first clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and then repeat that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>in the second clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? The repetition of this ruling indicates that these are two separate cases. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Shmuel </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason is </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: </span>I am avowed from you with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I eat </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours, </span>or with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I taste </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours; </span>it is for this reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is prohibited </span>from benefiting from his fellow, <span class="gemarra-regular">and his fellow is permitted </span>to benefit from him, as this formulation indicates that he is applying his vow only to himself. 

Daf 5a

<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said only: I am avowed from you, they are both prohibite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> from deriving benefit from one another. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">like that which Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: </span>If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am avowed from you, they are both prohibited. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna (47b) that if one says to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby to you </span>like an item <span class="gemarra-regular">dedicated </span>to the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one to whom the vow was said is prohibited </span>from deriving benefit from the one who made the vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the one who made the vow is not </span>prohibited from deriving benefit from the one with regard to whom the vow was said. However, according to Shmuel, both should be prohibited. The Gemara answers: It is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he specified </span>this by saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">And you are not </span>like an item dedicated to the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">for me.</span>
The Gemara asks: That mishna also taught that if one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">You are to me </span>like an item <span class="gemarra-regular">dedicated </span>to the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who makes the vow is prohibited </span>to derive benefit from the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the one to whom the vow was said is not </span>prohibited from deriving benefit from the one who makes the vow. However, according to Shmuel, both should be prohibited. The Gemara answers: Here too, it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he specified </span>this by saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">And I am not </span>like an item dedicated to the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">for you.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if he stated his vow in an <span class="gemarra-regular">unspecified </span>manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">what, are they both prohibited </span>from deriving benefit from each other? <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that it teaches in the latter clause </span>that if one says to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby to you, and you are to me, </span>like an item dedicated to the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are both prohibited </span>from deriving benefit from each other, it can be derived that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is in this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">both are prohibited, but </span>if one stated his vow in an <span class="gemarra-regular">unspecified </span>manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is prohibited </span>from deriving benefit from the other individual <span class="gemarra-regular">and the other is permitted </span>to derive benefit from him. This is not in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, this is </span>how the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, was stated: </span>If one said to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am avowed to you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they are both prohibited </span>from deriving benefit from one another. However, if he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am avowed from you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he is prohibited </span>from deriving benefit from the other person <span class="gemarra-regular">and the other is permitted </span>to derive benefit from him. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t the mishna teach </span>a case of one who declared: I am avowed <span class="gemarra-regular">from you, and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">we established the mishna, according to Shmuel, </span>as teaching that <span class="gemarra-regular">in all these </span>cases <span class="gemarra-regular">it is only </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he says: That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I taste </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours, or: That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I eat </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours, that he is prohibited </span>from deriving benefit from the other person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the other is permitted? However, </span>if he merely says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am avowed from you, they are both prohibited. </span>Consequently, Shmuel does not distinguish between the expressions: I am avowed from you, and: I am avowed to you. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, this is how </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel was originally stated: The reason is that he said: That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I eat </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours, or: That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I taste </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours. </span>It is for this reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is prohibited only from eating </span>anything belonging to the other person. However, if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am avowed from you, </span>without further specification, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is prohibited even from </span>deriving any form of <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit </span>from the other. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, let Shmuel say as follows: And if he said only: That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I eat </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours, or: That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I taste </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours, he is prohibited only from eating </span>an item belonging to his fellow, but he is permitted to derive benefit from it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, this is </span>how Shmuel’s opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated: The reason is that he said: That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I eat </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours, or: That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I taste </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours; it is </span>in these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is prohibited </span>from eating any item belonging to his fellow. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span>simply: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am avowed from you, </span>that statement <span class="gemarra-regular">does not indicat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that he said </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from eating an item belonging to his fellow. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? The statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am avowed from you, indicates: I am not speaking with you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Similarly, the statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am separated from you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> indicates: I am not doing business with you. </span>The statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am distanced from you, indicates that I will not stand within four cubits of you. </span>

Daf 5b

The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">shall we say that Shmuel holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">ambiguous intimations are not intimations, </span>i.e., if one employs an incomplete expression to declare a vow and the expression does not state clearly what his intention is, it does not produce a vow? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, Shmuel establishes the mishna in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who said: Ambiguous intimations are not intimations.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 85a–b): <span class="gemarra-regular">The essence of a bill of divorc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> is the sentence: <span class="gemarra-regular">You are hereby permitted to </span>marry <span class="gemarra-regular">any man. Rabbi Yehuda says </span>there is an additional statement that is an essential part of the divorce document: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this shall be to yo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">u</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from me a document of divorce [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">teirukhin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and a letter of dismissal. </span>This demonstrates that according to Rabbi Yehuda, the wording of the bill of divorce itself must clarify that the husband is divorcing his wife through the bill of divorce. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> strain to establish the mishna </span>as being <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>which is a minority opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him establish it </span>as being <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis that although there are no obvious intimations </span>in one’s statements, they are still considered vows. Consequently, if one said: I am avowed to you, even if he did not add: With regard to that which I eat, the vow takes effect.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: The mishna was difficult for him. Why does it teach </span>the cases where one adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I eat </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I taste </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">yours? Let it teach: That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I eat, </span>and: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">I taste, </span>without the additional phrase: Of yours. Since the one taking the vow is addressing another individual, it is clear to whom he is referring even without this phrase. <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we require obvious intimations, </span>i.e., the intent of the individual taking the vow must be indicated by his verbal statement and not merely by the context of his statement.
§ The Gemara addresses more fully the issue mentioned in passing in the previous discussion. <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">ambiguous intimations</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Abaye said: They are </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">intimations, and Rava said: They are not </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">intimations. Rava said: Rabbi Idi explained to me </span>the source of this ruling. <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: </span>“The vow of a <span class="gemarra-regular">nazirite, to consecrate himself [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nazir</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lehazir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to the Lord” </span>(Numbers 6:2). The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposes intimations of naziriteship, </span>derived earlier (3a) from the doubled term “<span class="it-text">nazir</span> <span class="it-text">lehazir</span>,” <span class="gemarra-regular">to naziriteship. </span>This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as </span>accepting <span class="gemarra-regular">nazirite-ship</span> must be expressed <span class="gemarra-regular">with a distinct articulation, so too, intimations of naziriteship </span>must be expressed <span class="gemarra-regular">with a distinct articulation </span>as opposed to ambiguous intimations.
The Gemara proposes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that </span>these <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to the </span>tannaitic <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 85a–b): <span class="gemarra-regular">The essence of a bill of divorce </span>is the sentence: <span class="gemarra-regular">You are hereby permitted to </span>marry <span class="gemarra-regular">any man. Rabbi Yehuda says </span>that there is an additional statement that is an essential part of the divorce document: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this shall be to you from me a document of divorce, a bill of release, and a letter of dismissal. </span>One could suggest that <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye, </span>who holds that ambiguous intimations are valid intimations, <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>his statement <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and Rava, </span>who holds that ambiguous intimations are not valid intimations, <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>his statement <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda.</span>
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: I say </span>my statement <span class="gemarra-regular">even in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yehuda </span><span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we require obvious intimations only with regard to a bill of divorce, as we require </span>full <span class="gemarra-regular">severance </span>of the relationship, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there is not </span>full severance unless the bill of divorce clearly states that the husband is divorcing his wife through that document. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, did you hear him </span>state <span class="gemarra-regular">generally </span>that ambiguous intimations are not valid intimations?
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I say </span>my statement <span class="gemarra-regular">even in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. The Rabbis say that we do not require obvious intimations only with regard to a bill of divorce, </span>

Daf 6a

<span class="gemarra-regular">as a man does not divorc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the wife of his fellow, </span>so it is obvious that he is writing the bill of divorce to his wife. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, did you hear them </span>state <span class="gemarra-regular">generally </span>that ambiguous intimations are valid intimations?
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>based upon the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one says with regard to an object lying before him: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is upon me, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is hereby upon me, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is forbidden, because it is an intimation </span>that he is rendering the object forbidden to himself like <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering. </span>This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason it is forbidden is </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Upon me. However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not say: Upon me, no, </span>it is not forbidden, because this expression is an ambiguous intimation. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation </span>of the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye, </span>who holds that even ambiguous intimations are valid intimations.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason it is forbidden is </span>that he specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Upon me. However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: It is hereby, and did not say: Upon me, </span>his statement is not considered an intimation of a vow at all, as he could have been <span class="gemarra-regular">saying: It is hereby ownerless </span>property, or: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is hereby charity. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that the object is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>his statement <span class="gemarra-regular">is an intimation </span>that he is rendering the object forbidden to himself like <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering. </span>With regard to consecrating an offering, even the statement: This is, without the additional phrase: Upon me, is considered an intimation. Nevertheless, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> indicates that if one does not say: Upon me, the vow does not take effect. This must be because an ambiguous intimation is not a vow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say </span>the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason is that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Upon me; </span>consequently, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is prohibited </span>from benefiting from the object, <span class="gemarra-regular">but another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>to benefit from it. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: It is hereby, </span>and did not add the expression: Upon me, <span class="gemarra-regular">both of them are prohibited </span>from benefiting from it <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> perhaps he is saying: It is hereby consecrated </span>property. In other words, there is concern that he may have actually consecrated the object rather than taking a vow that it is forbidden to him as though it were consecrated.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to this on the basis of the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is hereby a sin-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is hereby a guilt-offering, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even if he is liable </span>to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering or guilt-offering he has said nothing, </span>as this is an ambiguous intimation. However, if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is hereby my sin-offering, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is hereby my guilt-offering, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">if he was liable </span>to bring that offering <span class="gemarra-regular">his statement takes effect, </span>because this is an obvious intimation. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: </span>In accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who holds that ambiguous intimations are not intimations. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wasn’t it Abaye who said:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I say </span>that ambiguous intimations are valid intimations <span class="gemarra-regular">even according to </span>the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He retracted </span>this statement and admitted that Rabbi Yehuda holds that ambiguous intimations are not valid intimations.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But shall we say </span>that just as Abaye retracted his statement that his opinion can be stated even according to Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, who said </span>that ambiguous intimations are not valid intimations, also retracted his initial statement and admitted that his opinion is only <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>and is not in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: I say </span>my statement <span class="gemarra-regular">even according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">The Rabbis say that we do not require obvious intimations only with regard to a bill of divorce, as a man does not divorce the wife of his fellow, </span>so it is obvious that he is writing the bill of divorce to his wife. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, generally we require obvious intimations. </span>

Daf 6b

§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa raised a dilemma: Is there intimation for betrotha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or not? </span>Does betrothal take effect via an incomplete statement? The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of such a case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one said to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me, and he said to another </span>woman: <span class="gemarra-regular">And you too, isn’t </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is betrothal itself, </span>and it takes effect? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one said to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me, and he said to another </span>woman: <span class="gemarra-regular">And you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he said the other </span>woman: <span class="gemarra-regular">And you too </span>are betrothed, <span class="gemarra-regular">and betrothal takes effect with regard to the other </span>woman, <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps he said to the other </span>woman: <span class="gemarra-regular">And you se</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that I am betrothing this woman, <span class="gemarra-regular">and betrothal does not take effect with regard to the other </span>woman?
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did Rav Pappa raise this </span>as a <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma? But from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to Abaye </span>in a case concerning betrothal (see <span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 5b): <span class="gemarra-regular">Does Shmuel hold that ambiguous intimations </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">intimations, </span>it can be proven <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that Rav Pappa holds that there is intimation for betrothal. </span>The Gemara answers: Rav Pappa <span class="gemarra-regular">spoke to Abaye </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">one of </span>the opinions <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel held. </span>Shmuel had ruled that even an ambiguous intimation was sufficient in the case of betrothal, and Rav Pappa questioned this ruling without expressing his own opinion that even obvious intimations are not valid with regard to betrothal. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa raised </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: Is there intimation for </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the produce in the corner of a field that must be left for the poor, <span class="gemarra-regular">or is there no intimation for </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of the case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one said: This furrow [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ugeya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> shall be </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">too, this is </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">full-fledged </span>declaration of <span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">He raises the dilemma </span>with regard to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said: And this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he did not say: </span>And this one <span class="gemarra-regular">too, </span>and therefore his statement can be interpreted to mean that this other furrow should remain his and not be included in the <span class="it-text">pe’a</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosafot</span>). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in this case? 
The Gemara interrupts this train of thought and wonders: Does this prove <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one said: The entire field shall be </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it would all be rendered <span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The case must be one where the first furrow was large enough to serve as <span class="it-text">pe’a</span> for the entire field, because if that were not the case, it would be clear that he meant that the second furrow should also be <span class="it-text">pe’a</span>. Consequently, it is clear from Rav Pappa’s question that one can designate as <span class="it-text">pe’a</span> a larger portion of the field than one is absolutely required to designate.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, and it is taught </span>in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that if one wants to render his entire field </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>he may <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>so? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: </span>“You shall not wholly reap <span class="gemarra-regular">the corner of your field” </span>(Leviticus 19:9). This is expounded to mean that the entirety of “your field” may be designated as the “corner” that is left for the poor.
The Gemara returns to its discussion of Rav Pappa’s dilemma. <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span><span class="it-text">pe’a</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposed to offerings, just as offerings have intimation, so too, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has intimation? Or perhaps when </span><span class="it-text">pe’a</span> is juxtaposed to offerings, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is juxtaposed to </span>indicate only that it is subject to the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">You shall not delay? </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">And where is it juxtaposed? As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: 

Daf 7a

The verse states with regard to offerings: “When you shall take a vow to the Lord your God, you shall not delay to pay it; for the Lord your God will surely require it of you” (Deuteronomy 23:22). With regard to the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“of you” </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> states: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>a reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">gleanings</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forgotten </span>sheaves, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is there intimation for charity or is there no intimation for charity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The Gemara clarifies the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of such a case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that </span>it is a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">one said: This dinar is for charity and this also, that itself is </span>an explicit statement of donating to <span class="gemarra-regular">charity. Rather, </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said: This, and did not say: Also. What </span>is his intention? Is he understood to be <span class="gemarra-regular">saying: This is also charity, or perhaps what is the meaning of: And this? </span>He is <span class="gemarra-regular">saying </span>that this coin is <span class="gemarra-regular">merely </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for general use, and he did not complete his statement.</span>
The Gemara explains the two sides of this dilemma: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>charity is <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposed to offerings, as it is written </span>in a verse following the prohibition against delaying an offering: “That you have spoken <span class="gemarra-regular">with your mouth” </span>(Deuteronomy 23:24) and the Sages expounded that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>a reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">charity, </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as there is intimation, </span>i.e., intimation is effective, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to offerings, so too, there is intimation with regard to charity? Or perhaps </span>it is only with regard to the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">You shall not delay, that it is juxtaposed, </span>but not with regard to other <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>?
The Gemara asks further: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is there intimation for </span>rendering one’s property <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless, or perhaps there is no intimation for </span>rendering one’s property <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Does an incomplete expression employed by an owner to relinquish property take effect or not? The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>the same as the previous question with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">charity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is comparable to rendering one’s property ownerless for the benefit of the poor.
The Gemara responds: This question is <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>in the style of: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say, </span>as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say there is intimation for charity, as there is no partial </span>analogy based on <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposition, do we say </span>that rendering one’s property <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless is </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">charity; or perhaps charity is different, as charity is suitable only for the poor, but ownerless property </span>is suitable for <span class="gemarra-regular">both the poor and the wealthy, </span>and therefore it cannot be derived from the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to charity.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina raised </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: Is there intimation for </span>designating a location as <span class="gemarra-regular">a bathroom or not? </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of the case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that </span>it is a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">one said: Let this structure be a bathroom and this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">also, that </span>second structure <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">also a bathroom. Rather, </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said: And this, and he did not say: Also. What </span>is his intention? Is the expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this, that he said, </span>understood to mean: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this </span>shall <span class="gemarra-regular">also be a bathroom? Or perhaps what </span>is the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this? He is saying </span>that it is designated <span class="gemarra-regular">for general use </span>rather than as a bathroom.
The Gemara comments: Can it be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that it is obvious to Ravina that there is designation for a bathroom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., that if one explicitly designates a location as a bathroom, it attains that status even before it is used for that purpose, so that one may not bring sacred items to that location? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t Ravina raise this as a dilemma? </span>He asked: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">designated </span>a particular location <span class="gemarra-regular">as a bathroom, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? If one <span class="gemarra-regular">designated it as a bathhouse, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? In other words, <span class="gemarra-regular">is designation effective </span>to grant the location a particular status, <span class="gemarra-regular">or is designation not effective? </span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina raised one dilemma within another </span>dilemma: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is designation </span><span class="gemarra-regular">effective or is designation not effective? </span>And <span class="gemarra-regular">if you say there is designation, </span>i.e., designation is effective, <span class="gemarra-regular">is there intimation or is there not intimation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., is designation via intimation effective? The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">The dilemma remains </span>unresolved.
§ It was taught in the mishna that if one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am ostracized from you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Rabbi Akiva was uncertain about the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> but was inclined to rule stringently about this. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Rabbi Akiva concedes with regard to flogging that one is not flogged </span>if he violates a vow that was expressed in this way. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, if so, </span>if Rabbi Akiva held that one is liable to be flogged, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: Rabbi Akiva is stringent.</span> The fact that it states: Rabbi Akiva was uncertain but was inclined to rule stringently, indicates that although Rabbi Akiva holds that one may not violate this vow, he concedes that one is not liable to be flogged if he does violate the vow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: With </span>regard to a vow that one expressed with the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am distanced [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nadeina</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from you, everyone agrees that he is prohibited </span>from deriving benefit from the other individual, as this is an intimation of a vow. If he employs the expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am excommunicated [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">meshamattena</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from yo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">u</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> everyone agrees </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to derive benefit from the other person, even though he meant to distance himself from the other individual, because this is not the terminology of a vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what do they disagree? </span>

Daf 7b

They disagree <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>a case when the language one uses is: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am ostracize</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from you, as Rabbi Akiva holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a language of distancing </span>and therefore expresses a vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a language of excommunication, </span>and not the terminology with which people express vows. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rav Pappa <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>demonstrated in the following incident: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who said: I am excommunicated </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">the property of the son of Rav Yirmeya bar Abba. He came before Rav Ḥisda </span>to ask whether this statement was effective in generating a prohibition or not. Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: There is no one who, </span>in practice, <span class="gemarra-regular">is concerned for that </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Akiva. </span>Apparently, Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree with regard to </span>the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am excommunicated </span>from you. This indicates that the dispute between the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> is not with regard to specific terms but with regard to the more general question of whether terms of ostracism or excommunication are terms that can also express vows.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ila said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one ostracized </span>another individual <span class="gemarra-regular">in his presence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">dissolve </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for him only in his presence. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one ostracized him not in his presence, one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">dissolve it for him in his presence or not in his presence. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥanin said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: One who hears mention of the name </span>of God in vain <span class="gemarra-regular">by another </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">must ostracize him </span>for doing so. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he did not ostracize him, he himself, </span>the listener, <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be ostracized</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as wherever mention of God’s name </span>in vain <span class="gemarra-regular">is common, poverty is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">common there</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And poverty is </span>so harsh that it is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like death, as it is stated: “For all the men are dead </span>who sought your life” (Exodus 4:19). The Sages had a tradition that Dathan and Abiram had sought to have Moses killed in Egypt and that they were the men referred to in the quoted verse (see 64b). They were still alive at that time but had become impoverished. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>additionally, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wherever </span>it says that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages set their eyes </span>on a particular individual, the result was <span class="gemarra-regular">either death or poverty. </span>This also indicates that death and poverty are equivalent.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said: I was standing before Rav Huna, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he heard a certain woman utter a mention of the name </span>of God <span class="gemarra-regular">in vain. He excommunicated her and immediately dissolved </span>the excommunication <span class="gemarra-regular">for her in her presence. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn three things from this. Learn from this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who hears mention of the name </span>of God in vain <span class="gemarra-regular">by another </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">must ostracize him; and learn from this </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">one ostracized </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">in his presence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span>may <span class="gemarra-regular">dissolve </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for him only in his presence; and learn from this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is nothing, </span>i.e., no minimum time that must pass, <span class="gemarra-regular">between ostracism and nullification </span>of the ostracism.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Giddel said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: A Torah scholar </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">ostracize himself, and he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify </span>the ostracism <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that he can nullify the ostracism for himself, just as he is able to do for others? The Gemara answers: It states this <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say, </span>as per the popular maxim: <span class="gemarra-regular">A prisoner cannot free himself from prison, </span>and since he is ostracized he cannot dissolve the ostracism for himself; therefore it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that he can do so.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>where a Torah scholar might ostracize himself? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">like that </span>case involving <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra Ḥasida</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> When a student </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the academy was liable to </span>receive <span class="gemarra-regular">excommunication, </span>Mar Zutra Ḥasida would <span class="gemarra-regular">first excommunicate himsel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and then he would excommunicate the student </span>of Torah. <span class="gemarra-regular">And when he would enter his home, he would dissolve </span>the excommunication <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself and then dissolve </span>the excommunication <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the student.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Giddel said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>

Daf 8a

<span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that one may take an oath to fulfill a mitzva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “I have sworn and I have confirmed it, to observe Your righteous ordinances” </span>(Psalms 119:106).
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is he not already under oath from </span>when each Jew took an oath at <span class="gemarra-regular">Mount Sinai </span>to fulfill all the mitzvot? An oath cannot take effect if one is already bound by a different oath. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this: It is permitted for a ma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to motivate himself </span>to fulfill the mitzvot in this manner, although the oath is not technically valid.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Giddel said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: One who says: I will rise early and study this chapter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will study this tractate, has taken a great vow to the God of Israel. </span>This clearly indicates that the vow takes effect. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is he not already under oath </span>due to the general obligation to study Torah? <span class="gemarra-regular">And an oath does not take effect upon a </span>preexisting <span class="gemarra-regular">oath. What is he teaching us? </span>If one claims that Rav Giddel is teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>such a vow may be made <span class="gemarra-regular">even merely </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">motivate oneself </span>to study, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Giddel.</span>
The Gemara answers: It <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this: Since if he desires he can exempt himself </span>from the obligation to study Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">with the recitation </span>of <span class="gemarra-italic">Shem</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> in the <span class="gemarra-regular">morning and evening, due to that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">the oath takes effect upon hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> and he is obligated to study the chapter or tractate that he specified.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Giddel said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to another: Let us rise early and study this chapter, </span>and they agree to do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon him to rise earl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> and be the first to arrive, because it was his initiative. There is an allusion to this in a verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And He said to me: Arise, go forth into the plain, and there I will speak with you. </span>Then I arose <span class="gemarra-regular">and went forth into the plain; and behold, the glory of the Lord stood there” </span>(Ezekiel 3:22–23). God invited Ezekiel to that place, and His glory arrived before Ezekiel did.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: One </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">was ostracized in a drea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> requires ten peopl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to dissolve </span>the ostracism <span class="gemarra-regular">for him. And </span>the ostracism can be dissolved <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>by those <span class="gemarra-regular">who have studied </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., by Torah scholars. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if they have <span class="gemarra-regular">recited Mishna and have not studied</span> <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>they are not fit to dissolve the ostracism. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if there are not </span>ten people <span class="gemarra-regular">who have studied </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who have recited Mishna and have not studied </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> are fit to dissolve the ostracism.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if there are not </span>even ten people who have studied Mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">let him go and sit at the crossroad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and extend </span>a greeting of <span class="gemarra-italic">shalom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>meaning peace, <span class="gemarra-regular">to ten people</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who will respond with a similar greeting, <span class="gemarra-regular">until ten </span>individuals <span class="gemarra-regular">who have studied </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> happen to come to him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ashi: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he knows who excommunicated him </span>in his dream, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Can that individual <span class="gemarra-regular">dissolve </span>the excommunication <span class="gemarra-regular">for him? </span>Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>It is possible that <span class="gemarra-regular">he was appointed </span>by Heaven <span class="gemarra-regular">as an agent to excommunicate him, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">he was not appointed as an agent to dissolve </span>the excommunication <span class="gemarra-regular">for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Consequently, the excommunication can be dissolved only by ten people.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa said to Rav Ashi: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he was excommunicated and </span>the excommunication was <span class="gemarra-regular">dissolved for him in his dream, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Just as it is impossible for the grai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> to grow <span class="gemarra-regular">without straw, </span>

Daf 8b

<span class="gemarra-regular">so too, it is impossible to dream without idle matter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> It is possible that the excommunication was real and the dissolution was not real, and he must have the ostracism dissolved by ten people.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina’s wife had </span>taken <span class="gemarra-regular">a vo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> that he had not immediately nullified as a husband is entitled to do, and she wished to have it dissolved. Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Ash</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to whether <span class="gemarra-regular">a husband can become an agen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>express <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife’s regre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> to a court so that they can dissolve her vow? Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If </span>three people who can dissolve the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">assembled, yes; if </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>already assembled, <span class="gemarra-regular">no, </span>a husband cannot serve as an agent to express his wife’s regret to the court.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from this </span>incident <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a husband can become an agent to </span>express <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife’s regret. And learn from this </span>that a Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">is not permitted to dissolve a vow in the location of his teacher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is why Ravina, a distinguished Sage, did not dissolve the vow without consulting Rav Ashi. <span class="gemarra-regular">And learn from this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>three people <span class="gemarra-regular">were </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">assembled, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">seems well </span>for a husband to serve as an agent to express his wife’s regret, but if the three people were not yet assembled he cannot serve as her agent.
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>one may dissolve <span class="gemarra-regular">excommunication </span><span class="gemarra-regular">even in the location of his teacher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And an individual </span>Sage who is an <span class="gemarra-regular">expert </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">dissolve excommunicatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> even without two other judges.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon bar Zevid sai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Tavla said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya Arikha, </span>the tall, <span class="gemarra-regular">of the school of Rabbi Aḥa said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meyasha said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Elai:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “But to you that fear My name shall the sun of righteousness arise </span>with healing in its wings; and you shall go forth and leap as calves of the stall” (Malachi 3:20)? “You that fear My name”; <span class="gemarra-regular">these are people who are afraid to mention the name of Heaven in vain. </span>The verse states that <span class="gemarra-regular">a sun of righteousness with healing </span>will arise to heal them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Learn from this </span>verse that <span class="gemarra-regular">the dust [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥirga</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> that is illuminated by the rays of the sun during <span class="gemarra-regular">the day heals, </span>as it states: “With healing in its wings.”
The Gemara comments: Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: There is no Gehenna in the World-to-Come. Rather, the Holy One, Blessed be He, </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">remove the sun from its sheath [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">minartika</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">the righteous will be healed by it and the wicked will be punished by it. </span>The righteous will be healed by it, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “But to you that fear My name shall the sun </span>of righteousness <span class="gemarra-regular">arise </span>with healing in its wings”; <span class="gemarra-regular">and moreover, </span>not only will they be healed by it <span class="gemarra-regular">but they will </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rejuvenated by it, as it is stated: “And you shall go forth and leap as calves of the stall.”</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the wicked will be punished by </span>the same sun, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “For behold, the day is coming, it burns as a furnace; </span>and all the proud, and all that work wickedness, shall be stubble; and the day that comes shall set them ablaze” (Malachi 3:19). Consequently, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish holds that the sun heals only in the World-to-Come, whereas Abaye interprets the verse as referring to this world. 

Daf 9a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna continues to explain the rules of intimations of vows. If an individual states that he accepts an obligation upon himself <span class="gemarra-regular">like the vows of the wicked</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he has vowed with regard to</span> becoming <span class="gemarra-regular">a nazirite, or </span>bringing <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering, or </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath. </span>This is considered a real formulation of a vow, just as the wicked customarily take vows. If he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Like the vows of the virtuous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he has not said anything, </span>because virtuous people do not generally take vows. If he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Like their gift offerings</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has vowed with regard to </span>becoming <span class="gemarra-regular">a nazirite or </span>bringing <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks a question with regard to the first clause of the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">And perhaps this is what he is saying: I am not making a vow like the vows of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wicked</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in which case he does not intend to take a vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>It is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who said: Like the vows of the wicked I am hereby, </span>or: I accept <span class="gemarra-regular">upon myself, or: From it. </span>If he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby, </span>he is referring to his acceptance <span class="gemarra-regular">of naziriteship. </span>If he says: I accept <span class="gemarra-regular">upon myself, </span>he is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">From it, </span>he means to restrict himself from a particular activity <span class="gemarra-regular">through an oath.</span>
The Gemara challenges this explanation: If he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby, </span>does he necessarily intend to accept <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship? Perhaps he is saying: I am hereby </span>accepting upon myself <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fast</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shmuel said: </span>This is not a case where he simply said: I am hereby like the vows of the wicked; rather, it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where a nazirite was passing in front of him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the meaning of his statement is understood based on that context.
Shmuel had also stated that if he says: I accept <span class="gemarra-regular">upon myself, </span>he is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to an offering, </span>and if he says: From it, he means to restrict himself by means of an oath. The Gemara asks: If he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">From it, </span>does he necessarily mean to restrict himself <span class="gemarra-regular">through an oath? Perhaps he is saying: I will eat from </span>this loaf, rather than: I will not eat from it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The case is <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said: I will not eat from it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>he has explicitly clarified his intent, so <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">of stating </span>that this statement constitutes an oath? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that since <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not utter </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">oath from his mouth </span>the oath does not take effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">this teaches us </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>is nevertheless considered a valid intimation of an oath.
§ It was taught in the mishna that if one states that he accepts an obligation upon himself <span class="gemarra-regular">like the vows of the virtuous, he has not said anything. </span>However, if he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Like their gift offerings, he has vowed </span>with regard to becoming a nazirite and bringing an offering. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> according to whom </span>there is a <span class="gemarra-regular">difference between a vow and a gift </span>offering? <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir and not </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>either?
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“Better that you should not vow, </span>than that you should vow and not pay” (Ecclesiastes 5:4), that <span class="gemarra-regular">better than </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">this and that </span>is one <span class="gemarra-regular">who does not take a vow at all</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: Better than </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">this and that is one who vows and pays. </span>Consequently, Rabbi Meir advocates abstaining from all vows and Rabbi Yehuda advocates making vows and fulfilling them, but neither of them distinguishes between vows and gift offerings. The mishna, however, indicates that virtuous people do not make vows but do bring gift offerings.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">even say </span>that it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir. </span>

Daf 9b

<span class="gemarra-regular">When Rabbi Meir said </span>that one should abstain from making vows, he was referring only <span class="gemarra-regular">to a vow; he did not say it</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to a gift </span>offering. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But it is taught </span>in the mishna that if one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Like the gift offerings </span>of the virtuous, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has vowed with regard to </span>becoming <span class="gemarra-regular">a nazirite or </span>bringing <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering; </span>this indicates that the virtuous vow to become nazirites and bring offerings. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Teach </span>the mishna in the following emended formulation: <span class="gemarra-regular">He has volunteered with regard to </span>becoming <span class="gemarra-regular">a nazirite or </span>bringing <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different about one who vows, </span>i.e., one who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring an offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is not </span>proper to do due to the concern that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will encounter a stumbling block </span>and not bring <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>promptly, thereby violating the prohibition against delaying? One should <span class="gemarra-regular">also not </span>designate a particular animal as a <span class="gemarra-regular">gift </span>offering due to the concern that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he will encounter a stumbling block with it. </span>Once the animal is consecrated, anyone who unwittingly benefits from it, e.g., by shearing it or working with it, transgresses the prohibition against misusing consecrated property.
The Gemara answers: In the case of a gift offering, he can act <span class="gemarra-regular">like Hillel the Elder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">They said about Hillel the Elder that no person misused his burnt-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in his lifetime. </span>How did he ensure this? He was careful not to consecrate the animal in advance; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would bring it when it was unconsecrated to </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>there he would <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrate it, and </span>then immediately he would <span class="gemarra-regular">place his hand on its </span>head <span class="gemarra-regular">and slaughter it. </span>Consequently, there was no opportunity to misuse it.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This works out well </span>with regard to voluntary <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts </span>in the context <span class="gemarra-regular">of offerings, </span>but with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">voluntary </span>acceptance <span class="gemarra-regular">of naziriteship, what is there to say? </span>There is still room for concern that he will not fulfill the obligations incumbent upon him as a nazirite. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Meir <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon HaTzaddik.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon HaTzaddik said: In all my days </span>as a priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">I never ate the guilt-offering of a ritually impure nazirit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> except </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>occasion. <span class="gemarra-regular">One time, a particular man who was a nazirite came from the Sout</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and I saw that he had beautiful eyes and was good looking, and the fringes of his hair were arranged in curls. I said to him: My son, what did you see </span>that made you decide <span class="gemarra-regular">to destroy this beautiful hair of yours </span>by becoming a nazirite? A nazirite must shave off his hair at the completion of his term. If he becomes impure before the completion of his term, he shaves off his hair and starts his term of naziriteship again. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said to me: I was a shepherd for </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father in my city, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">I went to draw water from the spring, and I looked at my reflection [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">babavua</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> in the water <span class="gemarra-regular">and my </span>evil <span class="gemarra-regular">inclination quickly overcame m</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and sought to expel me from the world. I said to </span>myself: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wicked one! Why do you pride yourself in a world that is not yours? </span>Why are you proud <span class="gemarra-regular">of someone who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will eventually be </span>food in the grave <span class="gemarra-regular">for worms and maggots, </span>i.e., your body? I swear <span class="gemarra-regular">by the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">service </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that I shall shave you for </span>the sake of <span class="gemarra-regular">Heaven.</span>
Shimon HaTzaddik continues the narrative: <span class="gemarra-regular">I immediately arose and kissed him on his head. I said to him: My son, may there be more who take vows of naziriteship like yo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">u</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> among the Jewish people. About you the verse states: “When </span>either <span class="gemarra-regular">a man </span>or a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a nazirite, to consecrate himself to the Lord” </span>(Numbers 6:2). This is an example of voluntary acceptance of naziriteship, i.e., becoming a nazirite with entirely pure intentions rather than as a rash statement, e.g., while in a fit of anger.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Mani strongly objects to </span>the statement of Shimon HaTzaddik. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different about the guilt-offering of a ritually impure nazirite that </span>Shimon HaTzaddik <span class="gemarra-regular">did not eat, because </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it came as a result of sin </span>when the individual violated the terms of his naziriteship by becoming impure? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him also not eat all </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">guilt-offerings</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as they </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">come as a result of sin. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yona said to him: This is the reason: When they regret </span>their misdeeds <span class="gemarra-regular">they become nazirites</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and when they become ritually impure and the days of </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship are increased, </span>as they must become pure and then begin their terms of naziriteship again, <span class="gemarra-regular">they regret </span>having become nazirites. <span class="gemarra-regular">They will then turn out to be bringing non-sacred </span>animals <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since they do not wish to bring the offerings of a nazirite, their offerings are undesirable, and it is as though the animals are non-sacred.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>then Shimon HaTzaddik should have abstained from eating <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>the offerings of <span class="gemarra-regular">a ritually pure nazirite as well </span>for the same reason; perhaps he too regretted his decision to become a nazirite. The Gemara answers: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a pure nazirite </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>concern <span class="gemarra-regular">because he assessed himself </span>and realized <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>he was <span class="gemarra-regular">able to vow </span>and to keep his vow for the term of his naziriteship. However, in the case of a ritually impure nazirite, where the naziriteship was extended for longer than he had estimated due to his contracting impurity, there is concern that he regrets having become a nazirite.
The Gemara suggests a different answer to the question of the identity of the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> whose opinion is expressed in the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say: </span>

Daf 10a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>it can be argued that <span class="gemarra-regular">when Rabbi Yehuda said </span>that it is good to take a vow and fulfill it, he said it <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a gift </span>offering, but <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not say </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to vows.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t the mishna teaching </span>that according to Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">better than </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">this and that is one who vows [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">noder</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] and pays, </span>which indicates that he says this even about vows? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Teach </span>the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda with the following, emended formulation: Better than both this and that is <span class="gemarra-regular">one who volunteers [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nodev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>a gift offering <span class="gemarra-regular">and pays </span>it.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different about one who vows, </span>i.e., one who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring an offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is not </span>proper to do due to the concern that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">encounter a stumbling block </span>and not bring <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>promptly, thereby violating the prohibition against delaying? One should <span class="gemarra-regular">also not </span>designate a particular animal as <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gift </span>offering, due to the concern that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he will encounter a stumbling block with it.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as he said </span>explicitly in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">A person brings his lamb to </span>the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">courtyard and consecrates it </span>there, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">leans on it and slaughters it. </span>Consequently, there is no concern that he will encounter a stumbling block.
The Gemara asks: That <span class="gemarra-regular">works out</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> well </span>with regard to voluntary <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts </span>in the context <span class="gemarra-regular">of offerings, </span>but with regard to the <span class="gemarra-regular">volun-tary </span>acceptance <span class="gemarra-regular">of naziriteship, what is there to say? </span>There is still room for concern that one will not fulfill the obligations incumbent upon him as a nazirite.
The Gemara answers: Here, too, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: The early </span>generations of <span class="gemarra-regular">pious </span>men <span class="gemarra-regular">would desire to bring a sin-offering </span>but did not have the opportunity to do so <span class="gemarra-regular">because the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not bring about a stumbling block through them, </span>and they would not sin even unwittingly. <span class="gemarra-regular">What would they do? They would rise and volunteer naziriteship to the Omnipresent in order to be liable </span>to bring a <span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offering </span>of a nazirite <span class="gemarra-regular">to the Omnipresent.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: They did not take a vow of naziriteship. Rather, one who </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">want to bring a burnt-offering </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">volunteer and bring </span>it; one who would want to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a peace-offering </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">volunteer and bring </span>it; and one who would want to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">a thanks-offering and its four types of bread </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">volunteer and bring </span>them. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, they did not volunteer naziriteship in order that they not be called sinners. </span>According to Rabbi Shimon, naziriteship involves some element of sin, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And he shall make atonement for him, for that he sinned against the soul” </span>(Numbers 6:11). 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Shimon HaTzaddik, Rabbi Shimon, and Rabbi Elazar HaKappa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are all of the same opinion, that a nazirite is a sinner. </span>The statements of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shimon HaTzaddik and Rabbi Shimon </span>in this regard are <span class="gemarra-regular">that which we </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">said.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Elazar HaKappar the Distinguished </span>agrees, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar HaKappar the Distinguished says: </span>It is written with regard to the priest who sacrificed the offering of a nazirite: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shall make atonement for him, for that he sinned against the soul.</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Against which soul did </span>the nazirite <span class="gemarra-regular">sin? Rather, </span>his sin is <span class="gemarra-regular">that he caused himself suffering </span>by refraining <span class="gemarra-regular">from wine. Are </span>these <span class="gemarra-regular">matters not </span>inferred <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Just as this </span>nazirite, <span class="gemarra-regular">who causes himself suffering only </span>by refraining <span class="gemarra-regular">from wine, is called a sinner, one who causes himself suffering </span>by refraining <span class="gemarra-regular">from everything </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>to be considered a sinner. <span class="gemarra-regular">From here </span>it can be derived that <span class="gemarra-regular">whoever fasts </span>unnecessarily <span class="gemarra-regular">is called a sinner.</span>
The Gemara raises a question with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar HaKappar. <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t this verse written with regard to a ritually impure nazirite? </span>Consequently, only a nazirite who becomes impure shall be considered a sinner. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Elazar HaKappar holds that the verse uses this terminology with regard to a ritually impure nazirite <span class="gemarra-regular">because he repeated his sin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> However, becoming a nazirite is itself considered a sin.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to another </span>that a certain object is <span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>or <span class="gemarra-italic">konas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, these </span>expressions <span class="gemarra-regular">are substitutes </span>for the term <span class="gemarra-regular">offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">korban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the vow takes effect. <span class="gemarra-italic">Ḥerek</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥerekh</span> and <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥeref</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; these</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are substitutes </span>for the term indicating a <span class="gemarra-regular">dedication [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥerem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>to the Temple treasury. <span class="gemarra-italic">Nazik</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">naziaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-italic">paziaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; these are substitutes </span>for the term <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nazir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">Shevuta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shekuka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>or one who <span class="gemarra-regular">vows with </span>the term <span class="gemarra-italic">mohi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">these are substitutes </span>for the term <span class="gemarra-regular">oath [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shevua</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> disagreed about <span class="gemarra-regular">substitutes </span>for the language of vows. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They are </span>terms from <span class="gemarra-regular">a language of </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">nation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that mean offering, dedication, naziriteship, or oath. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: </span>These terms employ <span class="gemarra-regular">language that the Sages devised [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">badu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] with which </span>one can <span class="gemarra-regular">take a vow. </span>In order to explain the word <span class="it-text">badu</span>, he adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And so it states </span>with regard to Jeroboam: <span class="gemarra-regular">“In the month that he had devised [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bada</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] in his own heart” </span>(I Kings 12:33). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages established substitutes </span>for the language of vows? The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">so that one not </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">offering. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let him say </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">offering; </span>what is wrong with that? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps he will say: An offering to the Lord. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let him say: An offering to the Lord. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps he will say: To the Lord, and </span>he will then change his mind and <span class="gemarra-regular">not say: An offering, and he will </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">express the name of Heaven in vain. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>

Daf 10b

<span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that a person should not say:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> To the Lord a burnt-offering, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">To the Lord a meal-offering, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">To the Lord a thanks-offering, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">To the Lord a peace-offering, </span>but should mention the offering first and then state that it is for the Lord? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “An offering to the Lord” </span>(Leviticus 1:2). The reason for this is that if one first says: To the Lord, perhaps he will change his mind and not complete the sentence in order to avoid consecrating the offering, and he will have uttered the name of God in vain. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>individual discussed in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">who intended to mention the name of Heaven only upon an offering, the Torah said </span>that he should say: <span class="gemarra-regular">An offering to the Lord, </span>in order to avoid possibly mentioning the name of God in vain, with regard to one who actually mentions the Divine Name <span class="gemarra-regular">in vain, all the more so </span>it is clear that he has committed a severe transgression.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that this dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish is <span class="gemarra-regular">parallel to </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as it was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: </span>If one expresses a vow with <span class="gemarra-regular">substitutes for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">substitute terms</span> mentioned in the mishna, the vow takes effect and the items are <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden. And Beit Hillel say: </span>If one expresses a vow with <span class="gemarra-regular">substitutes for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">substitute terms </span>mentioned in the mishna, the vow does not take effect and the items are <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>correct that <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who says </span>that a vow expressed with <span class="gemarra-regular">substitutes for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">substitute terms </span>mentioned in the mishna takes effect and that the item is consequently <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">holds that substitutes </span>for the language of vows are terms from the <span class="gemarra-regular">language of </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">nations, </span>and therefore substitutes for those terms, which are also from foreign languages, should be equally acceptable? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one who says </span>that the vow does not take effect and the item is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted, </span>it must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds that </span>these terms are <span class="gemarra-regular">language that the Sages devised. </span>Consequently, substitutes for those terms, which the Sages did not declare to be acceptable terms for expressing a vow, do not cause a vow to take effect. 
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is possible <span class="gemarra-regular">that everyone </span>holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">substitutes </span>for the language of vows <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>terms from <span class="gemarra-regular">the language of </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">nations, and Beit Shammai hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the nations speak </span>using <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>substitutes for the terms mentioned in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">also, and Beit Hillel hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the nations do not speak </span>using <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>terms. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>an alternate response: Substitute terms themselves are terms from a foreign language. <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>issue <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">substitutes for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">substitute</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> terms </span>mentioned in the mishna, despite the fact that these terms themselves are not valid terms even in a foreign language, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>a concern that if they are not considered to express a vow, one will come to act leniently with regard to a vow expressed with the <span class="gemarra-regular">substitute</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> terms </span>mentioned in the mishna. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel hold: We do not </span>issue <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">substitutes for </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">substitute</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> terms </span>mentioned in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>a concern that one will come to act leniently with regard to a vow expressed with the <span class="gemarra-regular">substitute terms </span>themselves.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances of substitutes for substitute terms for vows? Rav Yosef teaches </span>that they include the following terms: <span class="gemarra-italic">Mekanamna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mekanaḥna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-italic">mekanasna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>These are verb forms of the terms <span class="it-text">konam</span>, <span class="it-text">konaḥ</span>, and <span class="it-text">konas</span> respectively, mentioned in the mishna. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances of substitutes for substitute terms for dedication [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥerem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]? </span>The Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">Mafsha’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teaches: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Ḥarakim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥarakhim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥarafim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara continues: What are the <span class="gemarra-regular">substitutes for substitute terms for naziriteship [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nezirut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]? Rav Yosef teaches: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Meḥazakna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">menazaḥna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-italic">mafiḥna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: If one uses the term <span class="gemarra-italic">mifḥazna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? If one uses the term <span class="gemarra-italic">mitḥazna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>?

Is he <span class="gemarra-regular">saying </span>that the item should be like a <span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in which case the vow takes effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">saying sweet cinnamon [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kineman</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">besem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>(see Exodus 30:23) and does not intend to express a vow with the word <span class="it-text">konam</span>?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ḥiyya, said to Rav Ashi: </span>If one uses the term <span class="gemarra-italic">kina</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> what is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is he <span class="gemarra-regular">saying </span>this term in reference to a <span class="gemarra-regular">chicken coop, </span>which is also called a <span class="it-text">kina</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps it is a term for </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> and expresses a vow? With regard to these cases, the Gemara says: <span class="gemarra-regular">The dilemma remains </span>unresolved.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances of substitutes for substitute terms of oaths [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shevua</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]? </span>The Gemara answers that this category includes the terms <span class="gemarra-italic">shevuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shevutiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-italic">shekukael</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara asks: Why is the term <span class="gemarra-italic">shevuel</span> included? This word <span class="gemarra-regular">indicates Shevuel, son of Gershom, </span>the proper name of an individual (see I Chronicles 26:24), and therefore it should not be considered a substitute term for an oath. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the list of terms includes <span class="gemarra-italic">shevuvael</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">shevutiel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-italic">shekukael</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. What is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>?<span class="gemarra-regular"> Shmuel said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ashivta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he has not said anything, </span>despite the fact that there is some similarity between this term and the word oath [<span class="it-text">shevua</span>].

§ It is taught in the mishna: If one used the terms <span class="it-text">shevuta</span> or <span class="it-text">shekuka</span>, or <span class="gemarra-regular">took a vow with </span>the term <span class="gemarra-italic">mohi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, these are substitute terms </span>for an oath. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> One who says </span>that he is taking an oath <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span><span class="gemarra-italic">moh</span><span class="gemarra-italic">i</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">has not said anything. </span>However, if he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">By an oath [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">bemomata</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Mohi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> these are </span>valid <span class="gemarra-regular">substitute terms for an oath.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">If one says </span>to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which I eat of yours </span>shall be considered <span class="gemarra-italic">laḥullin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is interpreted as though he said: <span class="it-text">La</span> <span class="it-text">ḥullin</span>, not non-sacred, and the food is thereby forbidden to him. Similarly, if he said that food shall be considered <span class="gemarra-regular">not valid </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-italic">dekhi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., not <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually pure, or </span>if he said the food shall be considered an offering that has become <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure, left over [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">notar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], or </span><span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its appointed time, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is forbidden.</span>

Rabbi Yehuda says: One who says </span>that an item shall be considered <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem, </span>instead of saying that it shall be considered like Jerusalem, <span class="gemarra-regular">has not said anything. </span>

Daf 11a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">They assumed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What is </span>the meaning of the term <span class="gemarra-italic">laḥullin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The individual is saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">It shall not [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">la</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] be non-sacred [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥullin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">rather </span>it should have the status of an <span class="gemarra-regular">offering.</span>
The Gemara says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is expressed in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna? If </span>you say it is that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, he does not hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">from a negative </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">infer a positive </span>statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">any condition that is not like the condition of the sons of </span>the tribe of <span class="gemarra-regular">Gad and the sons of </span>the tribe of <span class="gemarra-regular">Reuben, </span>when Moses gave them land on the eastern bank of the Jordan River (see Numbers 32:29–30), <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">condition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Moses phrased the agreement as a double condition, stating that if they would join the other tribes in battle they would receive their inheritance on the eastern bank of the Jordan River, and if not, they would not receive that territory. Because Rabbi Meir holds that only a condition expressed in this manner is valid, it is clear that he holds that one may not infer a negative statement from a positive one or vice versa.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara challenges this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say the latter clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: One who says </span>that an item shall be considered <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem has not said anything. From </span>the fact that the <span class="gemarra-regular">latter clause is </span>stated by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>it is clear that the <span class="gemarra-regular">first clause is not </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda.</span>
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">The</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> entire </span>mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and this is what </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: </span>Although one who declares an item to be like Jerusalem has taken a vow rendering it forbidden, one who says that an item shall be considered Jerusalem has not taken a vow. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Yehuda says, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says </span>that an item shall be considered <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem has not said anything, </span>since this expression has no meaning.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that an item should be <span class="gemarra-regular">like Jerusalem, is it prohibited according to Rabbi Yehuda? Isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: One who says </span>that an item shall be considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like Jerusalem has not said anything </span><span class="gemarra-regular">unless he vows by means of an item that is sacrificed in Jerusalem. </span>Consequently, the first clause of the mishna, which states that one has vowed if he declares an item to be like Jerusalem, cannot be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. 
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">The entire</span> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, and </span>the mishna and <span class="it-text">baraita</span> express the opinions of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 

Daf 11b

<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one declares food: <span class="gemarra-regular">Non-sacred, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">The non-sacred, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Like the non-sacred</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>he combines that expression with the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which I eat of yours, or: That which I do not eat of yours, </span>he has not expressed a vow and the food remains <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. </span>However, if he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which I eat of yours </span>shall be considered <span class="gemarra-italic">laḥullin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., not non-sacred, but rather consecrated, the food is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which I do not eat of yours </span>shall be considered <span class="gemarra-italic">laḥullin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the other individual’s food remains <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to him.
The Gemara analyzes this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is</span> the author of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is Rabbi Meir, who does not hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">from a negative </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">infer a positive </span>statement. Consequently, even if one said: That which I do not eat of yours shall be considered non-sacred, that does not indicate that what he does eat shall be considered consecrated.
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">say the latter clause </span>of that <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which I will not eat of yours </span>shall be considered <span class="gemarra-italic">laḥullin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the other individual’s food remains <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted</span> to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (13a) that if one says: That which <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not eat of yours </span>shall be considered <span class="gemarra-italic">lakorban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Rabbi Meir prohibits </span>him from eating food belonging to the other individual? <span class="it-text">Lakorban</span> apparently means <span class="it-text">la</span> <span class="it-text">korban</span>, it is not an offering. The reason for this opinion is that his statement indicates that what he does not eat is not an offering, but what he does eat shall be considered an offering. This <span class="gemarra-regular">poses a difficulty for us </span>because Rabbi Meir does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>hold that <span class="gemarra-regular">from a negative </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">infer a positive </span>statement.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>to answer this difficulty, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said: It is as though he said: It shall be for an offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lekorban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">therefor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I will not eat </span>that which is <span class="gemarra-regular">yours. Here too, </span>when he said: That which I will not eat of yours shall be considered <span class="it-text">laḥullin</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he said to him: It shall not be non-sacred, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">therefore I will not eat </span>that which is <span class="gemarra-regular">yours. </span>Consequently, the vow should take effect even according to Rabbi Meir; why does the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> rule that the vow does not take effect and the food remains permitted?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">holds in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir in one </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">and disagrees with his </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in another. He holds in accordance with his </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in one </span>case, in <span class="gemarra-regular">that he does not hold that from a negative </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">infer a positive </span>statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he disagrees with his </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in another </span>case, i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> offering. </span>This <span class="it-text">tanna</span> holds that if one says: That which I will not eat of yours shall be considered <span class="it-text">lakorban</span>, he does not mean: It is to be considered an offering and therefore I will not eat from that which is yours. Similarly, in the case in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> does not hold that the individual means to say: It shall not be non-sacred and therefore I will not eat that which is yours. In order to effect a vow, one must express it clearly. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>The apparent contradiction between the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> and the mishna can be resolved in a different manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>case in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said: </span>That which I will not eat of yours shall be considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as non-sacred</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>case, where it is forbidden, in accordance with Rabbi Meir’s ruling in the mishna, is <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said: </span>That which I will not eat of yours should <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as non-sacred, which indicates: It shall not be </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">rather like an offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore I will not eat it.
§ It is stated in the mishna that if one says that a food item shall be considered not <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually pure,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>if he said the food shall be considered an offering that has become <span class="gemarra-regular">ritually impure, left over [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">notar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], or </span><span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its appointed time, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is forbidden. Rami bar Ḥama raises a dilemma: </span>If one said with regard to a particular item: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">the meat of peace-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> after the sprinkling of </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">blood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is this an effective vow, which prohibits the item?
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he said </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">with this formulation, he is associating </span>the object of his vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with a permitted </span>item, as the meat of peace-offerings is permitted to be eaten after the blood is sprinkled on the altar. Consequently, the declaration does not express a vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he places the meat of peace-offerings </span>following the sprinkling of the blood in one place, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he places </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">that is permitted next to it. And he says: This is like that. </span>In this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is he associating </span>the object of his vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with the original </span>forbidden status of the peace-offering before the blood is sprinkled, <span class="gemarra-regular">or is he associating </span>the object of his vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with the </span>current <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>status of the peace-offering?
To resolve this question, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the mishna: If he said the food shall be considered an offering that has become <span class="gemarra-italic">notar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span><span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e. an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its appointed time, it is forbidden. 

Daf 12a

<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-italic">notar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are </span>conditions that apply <span class="gemarra-regular">after the sprinkling of the blood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> when the prohibition against misusing consecrated property, which the individual is attempting to extend to a permitted item, no longer applies. Since the vow takes effect, this proves that the individual is associating the object of his vow with the original forbidden status of the offering. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, said to him: </span>It is possible to say that it is speaking here about <span class="gemarra-italic">notar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a burnt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since a burnt-offering may not be eaten even after its blood is sprinkled, the original prohibition against misusing consecrated property continues to apply to the meat of this offering. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, let it teach </span>explicitly that the individual referred <span class="gemarra-regular">to the meat of a burnt-offering.</span>
The Gemara responds: The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is speaking </span>utilizing the style of: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is not necessary. It is not necessary </span>to state that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">associates </span>the object of his vow with <span class="gemarra-regular">meat of a burnt-offering, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden, as he extends </span>the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering </span>to the other item. However, if one extends the status of <span class="gemarra-italic">notar</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a burnt-offering, it is necessary to say </span>that the other item is forbidden.
It could <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say </span>that the individual intended to declare the item forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">like the prohibition of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">notar</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">like the prohibition of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and this would be like one who associates </span>the object of his vow with <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">item that is forbidden </span>by the Torah rather than an item forbidden by means of a vow. Consequently, the item <span class="gemarra-regular">is not forbidden, </span>as one can take a vow by associating the object of his vow with a forbidden item only if that item is itself prohibited due to a vow. The mishna therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that his intention is to transfer the prohibition of the offering, and the vow takes effect.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objectio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> based upon the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Which is the </span>vow of <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">issar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mentioned in the Torah? </span>It is a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">one said: I hereby </span>declare <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will not eat meat and I will not drink wine </span>today <span class="gemarra-regular">like the day his father died</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> referring to the father of the individual making the vow, as there is a custom to fast on the anniversary of a parent’s death, or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Like the day his teacher died, </span>as one mourns his primary teacher like a father, or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Like the day Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, was killed </span>(see Jeremiah, chapter 41), i.e., the Fast of Gedaliah, or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Like the day I saw Jerusalem in its </span>state of <span class="gemarra-regular">destruction. And Shmuel said: And this is if he was obligated by </span>a previous <span class="gemarra-regular">vow </span>to abstain from meat and wine <span class="gemarra-regular">on that day </span>that he refers to in his declaration.
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? Is it not </span>a case where, <span class="gemarra-regular">for example,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it was Sunday</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the same day of the week <span class="gemarra-regular">on which his father died? And although there were many permitted Sunday</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in the interim, nevertheless, when he said he would not eat meat or drink wine like the day of the week on which his father died, his intention was to the particular Sunday when his father died, when he had vowed to abstain from meat and wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teaches </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited. Learn from this that he associates </span>the object of his vow with <span class="gemarra-regular">the original </span>halakhic status of the Sunday his father died, and not the status of the intervening Sundays. Similarly, in the case of peace-offerings following the sprinkling of the blood, he is referring to the original status of the meat before the sprinkling of the blood.
The Gemara responds that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is how </span>the comment <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel was stated: Shmuel said: And this is if he was continuously obligated by a vow from that day forward </span>to abstain from meat and wine on the anniversary of his father’s death. Consequently, when he associates another day with the day of his father’s death, he expresses a vow based upon the current status of the day, and there is no proof with regard to the case of the meat of the peace-offering.
The Gemara cites another attempted proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>that which was taught in the mishna (13b): If one declares an item to be <span class="gemarra-regular">like the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Aaron</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the portion of dough given to the priests, <span class="gemarra-regular">or like his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the portion of agricultural produce given to priests, the item remains <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. </span>Although these items are prohibited to non-priests as soon as they are designated, they are considered forbidden by the Torah rather than forbidden by a vow. The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if one declares an item to be <span class="gemarra-regular">like the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the loaves of the thanks-offering, </span>i.e., the four loaves of the thanks-offering that were eaten by the priests, the item is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden. </span>

Daf 12b

Having made this inference, Ravina comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">But the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the loaves of the thanks-offering is </span>designated only <span class="gemarra-regular">after the sprinkling of the blood. </span>Consequently, the individual must have made his vow after the sprinkling of the blood, when these loaves are permitted to priests. If the vow nevertheless takes effect, it must be because the individual is referring to the original forbidden status of the loaves before the sprinkling of the blood. This indicates that one has in mind the original status of the item rather than its current status.
The Gemara refutes this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that when the mishna specifies that if one said the food should be like the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of Aaron it remains permitted it thereby indicates that if he said it should be <span class="gemarra-regular">like the collection of the </span>Temple treasury <span class="gemarra-regular">chamber</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is also called a <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and is always forbidden, the food becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden. </span>However, one cannot infer from the mishna that if one declares the food to be like the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the loaves of the thanks-offering the food becomes forbidden.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according to this, if one said the food should be like <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the loaves of the thanks-offering,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what, </span>does the food remain <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted? </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let it teach </span>in the mishna that if one said the food should be like the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">the loaves of the thanks-offering </span>it remains permitted even though the thanks-offering is forbidden by means of a vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>one would know on his own that if he says the food should be like the <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span>Aaron, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>the food remains permitted. The Gemara responds: It <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of the loaves of the thanks-offering </span>is also referred to as <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">terum</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> and is therefore included in the mishna.
The Gemara offers an alternative response to Ravina’s attempted proof from the case of the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the loaves of the thanks-offering, that one has in mind the original status of an item when one expresses a vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>that the <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the loaves of the thanks-offering </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be designated <span class="gemarra-regular">before the sprinkling of the blood, for example, when he separated </span>the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">during the kneading </span>of the dough. Consequently, the case may be where one makes the vow before the sprinkling of the blood, when the loaves are forbidden to all, and that is the reason the vow takes effect. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with that which Rav Tovi bar Kisna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one baked the loaves of the thanks-offerin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as four loave</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> rather than the forty loaves that should ideally be baked, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has fulfilled </span>his obligation. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it written </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">forty </span>loaves must be brought with the thanks-offering, ten loaves of each of the four different types? The Gemara answers: One must bake forty loaves in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>fulfill the <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzva </span>in the optimal fashion, but he has nevertheless fulfilled his obligation with four loaves, one of each type.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But he is required to take </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., designate one loaf of each type to be given to the priests. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say that he takes one </span>loaf of <span class="gemarra-regular">bread </span>of the four as <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for all </span>the others, <span class="gemarra-regular">but didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Menaḥot</span> 77b) with regard to the verse “And of it he shall present <span class="gemarra-regular">one out of each offering </span>for a gift to the Lord; it shall be the priest’s” (Leviticus 7:14), that it indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">that he should not take from one offering, </span>i.e., one type of loaf, <span class="gemarra-regular">for another? And if you would say that he takes a slice from each one </span>of the four loaves and gives them to the priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">but didn’t we learn </span>in that mishna that the word <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>in the verse indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">that he may not take a slic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> but rather a complete loaf?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be <span class="gemarra-regular">that he separated </span>the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">during </span>the time of <span class="gemarra-regular">kneading. He took one </span>piece of dough <span class="gemarra-regular">from the leavened bread, one from the loaves, one from the wafers, and one from the flour mixed with water and oil. </span>After separating one tenth of each type of dough for the priest, he then baked the remainder into four loaves. Since it is possible to separate the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> at the time of the kneading, before the sprinkling of the blood of the offering, it is possible that the case is one where he expressed the vow at this time. Consequently, there is no proof that one has in mind the original status of an offering rather than its current status when one expresses a vow after the sprinkling of the blood.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that this question, whether one intends to extend the original or current status of an offering, is <span class="gemarra-regular">parallel to </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>meat is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>like the meat of <span class="gemarra-regular">a firstborn</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Ya’akov renders </span>the meat <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden and Rabbi Yehuda renders </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted.</span>
The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that he associates the object of his vow with the status of a firstborn animal <span class="gemarra-regular">before the sprinkling of the blood, </span>when it is forbidden as a consecrated item, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the rationale of the one who renders </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted? And if </span>he associates the object of his vow with the status of a firstborn animal <span class="gemarra-regular">after the sprinkling of the blood, </span>when it belongs to the priest and is permitted to be eaten, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the rationale of the one who renders </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden? Rather, is it not </span>

Daf 13a

<span class="gemarra-regular">that he places the meat of a firstborn </span>animal in one place <span class="gemarra-regular">and he places another </span>piece of <span class="gemarra-regular">meat next to it,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he said: This </span>second piece of meat is hereby <span class="gemarra-regular">like that </span>meat of the firstborn animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span> about whether he is referring to the original forbidden status of the firstborn animal or its current permitted status? 
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, everyone</span> agrees that he is referring to the status of the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">before the sprinkling of the blood, and what is the reason of the one who renders </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted? The verse states: “When </span>a man <span class="gemarra-regular">takes a vow” </span>(Numbers 30:3), which indicates that he has not done so <span class="gemarra-regular">until he takes a vow with an item forbidden by means of a vow, </span>i.e., by extending the status of an item that itself was forbidden by a means of a vow. This comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude a firstborn, which is an item that is forbidden </span>by the Torah rather than by means of a vow; a firstborn animal is sacred simply because it is born first.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the one who renders </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>holds that it is because <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “To the Lord” </span>(Numbers 30:3), which comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>one who takes a vow by associating an object with an <span class="gemarra-regular">item that is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>by the Torah.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the one who renders </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>based on the principle that one cannot take a vow by associating the item with an item that is forbidden by the Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">what does he do with </span>the expression <span class="gemarra-regular">“to the Lord”? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He requires </span>this expression <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>include the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who associates </span>the object of his vow with <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering and a guilt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Although these offerings are obligatory rather than voluntary, and in that regard they are dissimilar to items forbidden by means of a vow, one can render another item forbidden by associating it with these offerings.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what did you see </span>that led you <span class="gemarra-regular">to include a sin-offering and a guilt-offering and to exclude the firstborn? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">I include the sin-offering and guilt-offering </span>due to the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that he associates </span>the object of his vow with an animal forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of a vow, </span>as it is the individual who designates a particular animal for one of these offerings. <span class="gemarra-regular">And I remove the firstborn, because it is sacred from its mother’s womb.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the one who renders </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>is of the opinion that one who says that a piece of meat shall be considered for him like the meat of a <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborn also associates </span>the object of his vow with an item forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">by a vow, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">They said in the name of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">one has a firstborn </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">born in his home </span>it is still <span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzva to consecrate it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> As it is stated: “The males you shall consecrate” </span>(Deuteronomy 15:19). Although a firstborn animal is considered consecrated from birth, its owner is still commanded to declare it consecrated, and it is therefore considered an item forbidden by means of a vow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the one who renders </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>in this case argues that although the owner is required to declare it consecrated, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he does not consecrate it, is it not consecrated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Since it is consecrated in any event, it is considered to have been rendered forbidden by the Torah rather than through a vow.
§ It is taught in the mishna that if one says that food shall be considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like the lamb [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">imra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>of the daily offering, or <span class="gemarra-regular">like the </span>animals designated as offerings and kept in special <span class="gemarra-regular">enclosures, </span>the vow takes effect.
It was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one says that food shall be considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a lamb, for a lamb, like a lamb; enclosures, for enclosures</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like enclosures; wood, for wood, like wood; fires, for fires, like fires; the altar, for the altar, like the altar; the Sanctuary, for the Sanctuary, like the Sanctuary; Jerusalem, for Jerusalem, like Jerusalem; </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all of them, </span>if he adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which I will eat of yours</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is forbidden. </span>This is because his intent is that whatever he eats that belongs to the other individual should be forbidden to him like one of these consecrated items. However, if he adds: That which <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not eat of yours, </span>the food is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted, </span>since the only implication of his statement is that whatever he does not eat shall be forbidden.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is </span>the Sage of whom <span class="gemarra-regular">we have heard, for whom there is no difference </span>whether one said <span class="gemarra-regular">a lamb, for a lamb, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">like a lamb, </span>that I eat of yours? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is Rabbi Meir. </span>Conversely, Rabbi Yehuda holds that the vow takes effect only if one says: Like a lamb.
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">say the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">all of them, </span>if he adds: That which <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not eat of yours, </span>the food remains <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. But didn’t we learn </span>in the next mishna that if one says: That which <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not eat of yours </span>shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">for an offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lekorban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], Rabbi Meir prohibits </span>him from eating food belonging to the other individual? <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Abba said </span>in explanation of this ruling that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is as though he said: It shall be for an offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lekorban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">therefore I will not eat </span>that which is <span class="gemarra-regular">yours. </span>Apparently, according to Rabbi Meir the food is forbidden even if he said: That which I will not eat of yours.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult: This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one said: </span>That which I do not eat from you shall <span class="gemarra-regular">not [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">la</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">for a lamb [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">le’imra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Although this statement implies that what he does eat shall be considered like the lamb of the daily offering, Rabbi Meir holds that one cannot infer a positive statement from a negative statement. Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said: For a lamb [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">le’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">imra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>In that case, his statement is interpreted as though he said: It shall be considered the lamb used for the daily offering, and therefore I will not eat it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: An offering, a burnt-offering, a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">meal-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering, a thanks-offering, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> peace-offering, </span>and adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which I eat of yours, </span>the vow takes effect and the food <span class="gemarra-regular">is forbidden. Rabbi Yehuda renders </span>the food <span class="gemarra-regular">permitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in all these cases. If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">The offering, like an offering, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering, </span>and adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which I will eat of yours, </span>the food <span class="gemarra-regular">is forbidden. </span>If he says: That which <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not eat of your </span>shall be <span class="gemarra-regular">for an offering, Rabbi Meir renders </span>the food <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It teaches </span>in the mishna that if one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">An offering, the offering, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">like an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and then adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which I will eat of yours, it is forbidden. </span>This indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">this unattributed </span>opinion in the <span class="gemarra-regular">mishna </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, for whom there is no difference whether </span>one says <span class="gemarra-regular">a lamb [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">imra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">as a lamb [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">le’imra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">].</span>
The Gemara asks: However, <span class="gemarra-regular">if it is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, that which it teaches </span>is difficult. It teaches that if one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">The offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hakorban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>and adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which I will eat of yours, </span>the food <span class="gemarra-regular">is forbidden. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span><span class="gemarra-regular">concede to Rabbi Yehuda </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says: This offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ha</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">korban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], or this burnt-offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ha</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ola</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], or this meal-offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ha</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">minḥa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], or this sin-offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ha</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥatat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>and then adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">That I will eat of yours, </span>the vow does not take effect and the food <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted? </span>The reason for this is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the individual <span class="gemarra-regular">did not take a vow </span>that the item should be associated with an offering; <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>he took a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">by the life of the offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is not a valid expression of a vow. 

Daf 13b

The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>case, where the vow does not take effect, is <span class="gemarra-regular">where one said: This offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ha</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">korban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, where the vow does take effect, is <span class="gemarra-regular">where one said: The offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hakorban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> What is the reason </span>that the vow does not take effect when he says this offering [<span class="it-text">ha</span> <span class="it-text">korban</span>]? It is because <span class="gemarra-regular">he is saying </span>that he is taking a vow by <span class="gemarra-regular">the life of </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">offering, </span>which is not a valid way to express a vow.
The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that if one says: That which <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not eat of yours is</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lakorban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which indicates <span class="it-text">la</span> <span class="it-text">korban</span>, it is not an offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir prohibits </span>him from eating food belonging to the other individual. This is because his statement indicates that what he does eat shall be considered an offering. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>it true that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir does not hold that from a negative </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">infer a positive </span>statement? The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said: It is as though he said: It shall be for an offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lekorban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">therefore I will not eat </span>that which is <span class="gemarra-regular">yours.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who says to another: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me for <span class="gemarra-regular">my mouth </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">speak with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or: It is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me for <span class="gemarra-regular">my hand </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">work with you, </span>or: It is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me for <span class="gemarra-regular">my foot </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">walk with you, it is prohibited </span>for him to speak with, work with, or walk with the other individual.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: There is a <span class="gemarra-regular">stricture </span>that applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to oaths beyond </span>the strictures that apply <span class="gemarra-regular">to vows, and </span>there is a stricture that applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to vows beyond </span>the strictures that apply <span class="gemarra-regular">to oaths. The stricture </span>that applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to vows is that vows take effect with regard to a mitzva as </span>they do <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to optional </span>activities, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is not the case with regard to oaths, </span>as one cannot take an oath to neglect a mitzva. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the stricture </span>that applies <span class="gemarra-regular">to oaths is that oaths take effect upon a matter that has substance and a matter that does not have </span><span class="gemarra-regular">substance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">which is not the case with regard to vows, </span>which take effect only upon a matter that has substance. This contradicts the mishna, which states that a vow can apply to speech or actions, which are not physical items that have concrete substance.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: </span>The mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who says: My mouth shall be forbidden </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to my speech</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">My hands </span>shall be forbidden with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to their work, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">My feet </span>should be forbidden with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to their walking. </span>In these cases the vow applies to a limb, which is a concrete item, and therefore it takes effect. The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise </span>according to this interpretation, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it teaches: </span>For <span class="gemarra-regular">my mouth </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">speak with you, and it does not teach: That which I speak with you. </span>This indicates that he imposed the vow upon his mouth and not upon the act of speaking.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">And these are </span>the vows in which the one who takes the vow attempts to create a prohibition on an item by associating it with an item in an ineffective manner, rendering the vow void and leaving the item <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted: </span>If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which I will eat of yours </span>will be <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥullin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> or: That which I will eat of yours will be <span class="gemarra-regular">like pig </span><span class="gemarra-regular">meat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Like </span>an object of <span class="gemarra-regular">idol worship;</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">hides </span>of animal offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">whose hearts were </span><span class="gemarra-regular">remove</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> as a form of idol worship, and it is therefore prohibited to derive benefit from those animals; or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Like animal carcasses and animals with a wound that will cause them to die within twelve months [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tereifot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]; </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Like </span>non-kosher <span class="gemarra-regular">repugnant creatures and </span>non-kosher <span class="gemarra-regular">creeping animals;</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Like the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥall</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of Aaron, </span>the first priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">or like his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> in all these cases, the food is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. </span>Although none of these items may be eaten, they are forbidden by Torah law, not by means of a vow. Therefore, it is impossible to extend their prohibition to other items by means of a vow that associates them with those items. 
With regard to a man <span class="gemarra-regular">who says to his wife:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> You are hereby to me like </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">mother, </span>i.e., deriving benefit from you should be forbidden to me like engaging in sexual intercourse with my mother, dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">is broached with hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by </span>suggesting <span class="gemarra-regular">a different extenuation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a halakhic authority suggests other, extenuating circumstances that enable the dissolution of the vow. Although this vow does not take effect either, as engaging in sexual intercourse with one’s mother is prohibited by Torah law, by rabbinic law this is treated like an actual vow and requires dissolution by a halakhic authority, so <span class="gemarra-regular">that he will not </span>take genuine vows <span class="gemarra-regular">lightly.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It may be inferred from the first case in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>the vow does not take effect is <span class="gemarra-regular">that he said: That which I will eat of yours </span>will be <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥullin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: That which I will eat of yours </span>will be <span class="gemarra-italic">laḥullin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">indicates </span>that he is saying: It <span class="gemarra-regular">will not [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">la</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] be non-sacred [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥullin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">rather </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering, </span>which is a vow that takes effect. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is expressed in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna? If </span>it is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, isn’t he of </span>the opinion that one does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>say: <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>

Daf 14a

<span class="gemarra-regular">a negative </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">infer a positive </span>statement? How then can it be inferred that it should be like an offering? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-regular">rather </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>who disagrees with Rabbi Meir in this matter, the ruling of the mishna is superfluous, as <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>identical to the ruling of the mishna in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause. </span>The mishna above (10b) already established that a vow that uses the term <span class="it-text">laḥullin</span> takes effect.
The Gemara answers: The ruling is superfluous. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that the vow does not take effect when he says that the food will be <span class="gemarra-regular">like pig meat </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>an object of <span class="gemarra-regular">idol worship, it therefore teaches </span>incidentally that this ruling also applies when he says that it will be <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>what the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: And these are </span>the vows that do not take effect at all and therefore the item mentioned in the vow remains <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted: </span>One who said that a certain item will be <span class="gemarra-regular">like non-sacred</span> food, or <span class="gemarra-regular">like pig meat, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>an object of <span class="gemarra-regular">idol worship. And if it did not teach </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred </span>food, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would say </span>that although the vow does not take effect, it still <span class="gemarra-regular">requires, </span>by rabbinic law, <span class="gemarra-regular">a request </span>to a halakhic authority for its dissolution.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is there </span>any reason <span class="gemarra-regular">to consider</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>interpretation? <span class="gemarra-regular">But from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the latter clause teaches </span>with regard to a man <span class="gemarra-regular">who says to his wife: You are hereby to me like </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">mother, </span>that dissolution is <span class="gemarra-regular">broached with him by </span>suggesting <span class="gemarra-regular">a different extenuation, it may be inferred that </span>the vow in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-regular">clause does not necessitate a request </span>to a halakhic authority. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the interpretation of Ravina must be rejected, and <span class="gemarra-regular">it is clear </span>that the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">was cited tangentially </span>to the other cases in the mishna. 
§ With regard to the principle that a prohibition cannot be created by associating a permitted item with one forbidden by Torah law, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where is this matter </span>derived? The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “When a man takes a vow to the Lord” </span>(Numbers 30:3), which indicates that a vow does not take effect <span class="gemarra-regular">until one takes a vow </span>by associating the status <span class="gemarra-regular">of an item that is </span>forbidden by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a vo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> with another item. If the item one is using to create the prohibition is forbidden by Torah law, the vow does not take effect.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if the item in the vow is associated <span class="gemarra-regular">with an item forbidden </span>by Torah law, the vow should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>take effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>following that phrase in the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “To bind his soul with a bond [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">issar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">],” </span>which indicates that the association can be with an item forbidden [<span class="it-text">asur</span>] by Torah law. The Gemara answers: The phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“To bind his soul with a bond” is necessar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (12a): <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the bond mentioned in the Torah. </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> derives from this phrase that a vow that associates the relevant item with an item whose prohibition was created by a pre-existing vow takes effect, but one whose prohibition is by Torah law does not take effect. 
§ It is stated in the mishna that with regard to a man <span class="gemarra-regular">who says to his wife: You are hereby </span>to me <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">mother, </span>dissolution is broached with him suggesting a different extenuation, i.e., by rabbinic law it is treated like an actual vow and it requires dissolution by a halakhic authority. The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that states that if a man says to his wife: <span class="gemarra-regular">You are hereby to me like the flesh of </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">mother</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">like the flesh of my sister, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">like the fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">orla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or like </span>forbidden mixtures of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds </span>planted <span class="gemarra-regular">in a vineyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> all forbidden items, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has said nothing. </span>This indicates that he does not even have to make a request to a halakhic authority. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: He has said nothing by Torah law, </span>as the vow does not take effect. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, he needs </span>to make <span class="gemarra-regular">a request </span>to a halakhic authority <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law. Rava said: That </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to Torah scholars</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who are aware that this vow does not take effect. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>mishna, on the other hand, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to an ignoramus, </span>with regard to whom a rabbinic ordinance is necessary lest they take vows lightly. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who takes a vow </span>by associating an item <span class="gemarra-regular">with a Torah </span>scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">has not said anything, </span>i.e., the vow does not take effect. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: But </span>nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">he needs </span>to make <span class="gemarra-regular">a request to a halakhic authority </span>for dissolution of the vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman said: And </span>if he is <span class="gemarra-regular">a Torah scholar </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">does not need </span>to make <span class="gemarra-regular">a request</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The postulation of Rava, which states that with regard to some vows that do not take effect it is necessary to make a request to a halakhic authority only if they are taken by an ignoramus, can be seen from here. 

Daf 14b

§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who takes a vow </span>by associating an item <span class="gemarra-regular">with a Torah </span>scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">has not said anything, </span>and the vow does not take effect. However, he associates the item <span class="gemarra-regular">with what is written in </span>the Torah scroll, <span class="gemarra-regular">his statement is upheld. </span>Since the name of God is written in the Torah, he has invoked God’s name in his vow. If he associates the item <span class="gemarra-regular">with it and with</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is written in it, his statement is upheld.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>that if he associates the item <span class="gemarra-regular">with what is written in </span>the Torah scroll, <span class="gemarra-regular">his statement is upheld. Need it be said </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is the same if he associates the item <span class="gemarra-regular">with it and with what is written in it? </span>That is obvious. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>case, in which the item is associated with it and with what is written in it, is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">where the Torah </span>scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">is placed on the ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> while <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, in which the item is associated with what is written in it, is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">where he is holding it in his hands. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">it is placed on the ground, </span>whether one mentions the Torah scroll or what is written in it, <span class="gemarra-regular">his thoughts are concerning the parchment,</span> i.e., the physical scroll, as he naturally assumes that since the scroll is placed on the ground, the parchment must be blank. Therefore, the vow takes effect only if he mentions both it and what is written in it, indicating that he is aware that it is a Torah scroll. However, where <span class="gemarra-regular">he is holding it in his hands </span>and associates the item with what is written in it, <span class="gemarra-regular">his thoughts are concerning the mentions [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">azkarot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>of the name of God <span class="gemarra-regular">that are in it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the vow takes effect.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that the entire <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where it is placed on the ground, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span>middle clause of: With what is written in the Torah scroll, <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that even though it is placed on the ground, since he said: With what is written in it, it is </span>an <span class="gemarra-regular">effective </span>vow, as he was clearly referring to the names of God. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>employing the style: <span class="gemarra-regular">This, and it is unnecessary to say that. </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> where he said: What is written in it, which has a novel element, and then states a more obvious ruling, i.e., it goes without saying that if he associates the item with it and with what is written in it, the vow takes effect.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire middle clause, </span>i.e., the latter clause, where he associates the item with it and with what is written in it, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he is holding </span>the Torah scroll <span class="gemarra-regular">in his hands. And </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this: Since he is holding it in his hands, even though he said only: With </span>the Torah scroll, and did not explicitly state: With what is written in it, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">considered </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">like one who said: With what is written in it. </span>Therefore, the item is prohibited. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to one who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sleeping is </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">for me as if </span>it were <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> thereby prohibiting himself from sleeping; or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Speaking </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me; </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Walking is </span><span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me; </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to his wife: Engaging in sexual intercourse with you is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>if he violates the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">he is in </span>violation of the prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">“He shall not profane his word” </span>(Numbers 30:3).
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It was stated </span>that with regard to one who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sleeping is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for my eyes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">toda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">if I will sleep tomorrow, Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: He may not sleep today, lest he sleep tomorrow </span>and thereby cause the vow to have been violated today, retroactively. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman said: He may sleep today, </span>as there is currently no prohibition, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we are not concerned that he will perhaps sleep tomorrow, </span>as he will be careful not to sleep. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Yehuda concedes </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he says: Sleeping is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for my eyes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">tomorro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">if I sleep today, he may sleep today. </span>

Daf 15a

Sleeping today is not prohibited for him. Rather, it causes sleeping to be prohibited for him tomorrow, because <span class="gemarra-regular">when</span> one <span class="gemarra-regular">is not careful, </span>it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a condition. </span>In the former case, sleeping on the second day merely fulfills the condition on which the prohibition was based, causing it to take effect retroactively. Therefore, there is concern that he will not be careful and retroactively cause a violation. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">is careful with regard to a prohibition. </span>In the latter case, sleeping on the second day is directly prohibited. Therefore, there is no concern that he will violate the prohibition.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to the opinion of Rav Yehuda: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna that one who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sleeping is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Walking is </span><span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me,</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Speaking is </span><span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me, </span>may not violate his vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? If we say </span>that the wording of the vow is precisely <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span> the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches, is </span>the vow: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sleeping is </span><span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me, </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">vow? But didn’t we learn </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: There is <span class="gemarra-regular">stringency with regard to oaths </span>vis-à-vis vows, in <span class="gemarra-regular">that oaths apply to something that has actual </span>substance <span class="gemarra-regular">and to something that does not have actual </span>substance, <span class="gemarra-regular">which is not the case with regard to vows. And sleep is something that does not have actual </span>substance, so how can a vow apply to sleep? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the mishna must be referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said: Sleeping is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for my eyes. </span>
The Gemara questions this interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he did not give a measurement </span>to the prohibition created by the vow, but rather prohibited himself from sleeping for an unlimited period of time, <span class="gemarra-regular">do we let him </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">until he </span>inevitably <span class="gemarra-regular">transgresse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the prohibition: He shall not profane, </span>by falling asleep? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say </span>that if one says: I hereby take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will not sleep for three days</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the court <span class="gemarra-regular">flogs him </span>for taking an oath in vain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he may sleep immediately</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as he is incapable of fulfilling his oath? Here too, if the prohibition has no time frame, the vow should not take effect. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the mishna must be referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Sleeping is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to my eyes tomorrow if I sleep today. </span>The mishna rules that he may not sleep today, lest he transgress the prohibition of: He shall not profane, by sleeping tomorrow. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t you say </span>that with regard to this vow it is agreed that he may sleep today, as one <span class="gemarra-regular">is careful with regard to any </span>direct <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition </span>and will not violate the vow tomorrow? If so, why is it prohibited for him to sleep today?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious </span>that the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Sleeping is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to my eyes today if I sleep tomorrow. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he does not sleep today, when he sleeps tomorrow, what </span>transgression of: <span class="gemarra-regular">He shall not profane his word, is there? Rather, is it not with regard to </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he slept </span>on the first day, and therefore the mishna warns him not to sleep on the second day lest he transgress the prohibition retroactively? <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, there is </span>a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">in which he sleeps </span>on the first day. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">a refutation </span>of the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yehuda </span>that he may not sleep today lest he sleep tomorrow as well, thereby violating the prohibition. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that he may not sleep tomorrow, it does not mean that today he may sleep <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>. Rather, it means <span class="gemarra-regular">that if he did sleep </span>today he must be careful not to sleep tomorrow. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said </span>a different answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>the mishna may be interpreted <span class="gemarra-regular">as it teaches, </span>i.e., sleeping is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me. The vow does not take effect, as sleep does not have actual substance. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the reason the mishna states that if he sleeps he is in violation of the prohibition:<span class="gemarra-regular"> He shall not profane? </span>He transgresses the prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Although the vow does not take effect by Torah law, the Sages prohibited him from breaking his word.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But is there a </span>prohibition of:<span class="gemarra-regular"> He shall not profane, by rabbinic law?</span> The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, and it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">matters that are permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but others are accustomed to observe a prohibition with regard to them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you may not permit </span>these matters <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>those people, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “He shall not profane his word” </span>(Numbers 30:3). If they contravene their custom they are in violation of the prohibition: He shall not profane his word, by rabbinic law, as that is similar to violating a vow.
The Gemara attempts again to raise a difficulty with regard to Rav Yehuda’s opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna (57a) that if a man said to his wife: <span class="gemarra-regular">Deriving benefit from me until Passover </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for yo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">u</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if you go to your father’s house until the </span>following <span class="gemarra-regular">festival </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, then, if <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span><span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>to her father’s house <span class="gemarra-regular">before Passover, she is prohibited from deriving benefit from him until Passover, </span>as she violated the condition, thereby enabling the vow to take effect. 
The Gemara infers: Only if <span class="gemarra-regular">she went before Passover </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited for her </span>to derive benefit from him. However, if <span class="gemarra-regular">she did not go, </span>she is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>prohibited from deriving benefit from him. Apparently, even though she can transgress the condition retroactively until <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> by going to her father’s house, there is no concern that she will do so. This is difficult according to Rav Yehuda, who prohibits transgression of a conditional vow that may take effect retroactively.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said </span>that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> can be interpreted as follows: If <span class="gemarra-regular">she went before Passover, she </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from </span>deriving benefit from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>if she does so <span class="gemarra-regular">she is flogged</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If <span class="gemarra-regular">she did not go </span>before Passover, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">merely prohibited for her </span>to derive benefit from him, lest she violate the condition and cause the vow to take effect retroactively. However, she is not liable to be flogged for it, as the vow has not yet taken effect. 
The Gemara counters: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say the latter clause </span>of that mishna, which states that if she goes to her father’s house <span class="gemarra-regular">after</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Passover </span>she is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>violation of: <span class="gemarra-regular">He shall not profane his word. And if </span>the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where she did not derive benefit </span>from him <span class="gemarra-regular">before Passover, is there </span>a transgression of: <span class="gemarra-regular">He shall not profane? </span>Clearly the vow was not violated. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious that she derived benefit </span>from him before Passover, and therefore if she goes to her father’s house between Passover and <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> she violates the vow retroactively. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, she may derive benefit </span>from him, even though she can subsequently violate the vow by transgressing the condition. 

Daf 15b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> conclusive refutation </span>of the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Yehuda.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>this, it does not mean that before she went she was permitted to derive benefit from him <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>. Rather, it means <span class="gemarra-regular">that if she derived benefit </span>from him after the fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">she is in </span>violation of: <span class="gemarra-regular">He shall not profane his word.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learn </span>further on (57b) that if the husband said to his wife: <span class="gemarra-regular">Deriving benefit from me until the festival </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span> is <span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for yo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">u</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if you go to your father’s house until Passover, </span>then, if <span class="gemarra-regular">she went before Passover, she </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from deriving benefit from him until the festival </span>of <span class="it-text">Sukkot</span>, as the vow took effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">and she is permitted to go </span>to her father’s house <span class="gemarra-regular">after Passover. </span>
The Gemara infers: Only if <span class="gemarra-regular">she went</span> before Passover is it <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited for her </span>to derive benefit from him. However, if <span class="gemarra-regular">she did not go </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>prohibited for her to do so. She may derive benefit from him, and there is no concern that she will subsequently go to her father’s house, transgressing the prohibition. This is difficult according to the opinion of Rav Yehuda that one may not perform an action that will be rendered retroactively a violation of a vow if the condition is met. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: The same is true, that even if she did not go, she </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from </span>deriving benefit from him. The difference is that if <span class="gemarra-regular">she went </span>it is not only <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited for her </span>to derive benefit from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if she does so <span class="gemarra-regular">she is flogged; </span>whereas if <span class="gemarra-regular">she did not go, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">merely prohibited for her </span>to derive benefit from him, lest she violate the vow by going to her father’s house before Passover.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>to the opinion of Rav Yehuda: It is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that if one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This loaf is </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me toda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if I go to such and such a place tomorrow, </span>then if <span class="gemarra-regular">he ate </span>the loaf today, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is subject to </span>the prohibition that <span class="gemarra-regular">he shall not go </span>tomorrow. Apparently, he may eat it today, as there is no concern that he will go tomorrow. 
The Gemara answers: Where is the contradiction? <span class="gemarra-regular">Does </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he may eat </span>the loaf <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">It teaches </span>only that <span class="gemarra-regular">he ate, </span>i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">once he ate, he is subject to </span>the prohibition that <span class="gemarra-regular">he shall not go. </span>
It is further taught in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he went </span>the next day, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is in </span>violation of: <span class="gemarra-regular">He shall not profane his word. </span>The Gemara infers from the fact that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring only to a case in which he went after the fact, that <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not g</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span> <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>. This indicates that he is permitted to eat the loaf, thereby prohibiting himself from going the next day. This accords with the opinion of Rav Naḥman that one may cause a vow to take effect by fulfilling its condition, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a difficulty to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda. </span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the same is true, that </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">could have taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he may go. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">since the first clause teaches </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> where <span class="gemarra-regular">he ate </span>the loaf after the fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it cannot teach </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he may eat </span>it according to Rav Yehuda, who holds that it is prohibited for him to eat it <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he went, </span>and does not teach that he may go, to maintain a uniform style. In conclusion, neither opinion is refuted.
§ It is taught in the mishna that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to his wife: Engaging in sexual intercourse with you is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me, </span>if he violates the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">he is in </span>violation of the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">He shall not profane his word. </span>The Gemara asks: How can one render prohibited engaging in sexual intercourse with his wife? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t he duty boun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by Torah law to </span>engage in sexual intercourse with <span class="gemarra-regular">her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is written: “Her food, her clothing, and her conjugal rights he may not diminish” </span>(Exodus 21:10)? 
The Gemara answers: The vow does not take effect if it is formulated as cited. Rather, the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he says: The pleasure </span>I derive <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>engaging in <span class="gemarra-regular">sexual intercourse with you is </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and sexual intercourse is </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">not amenable to him. </span>Since he is not obligated to experience the pleasure he derives from sexual intercourse with her, he can prohibit himself from experiencing this pleasure. In this manner he can render their sexual intercourse forbidden by means of a vow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Kahana said: </span>If a woman vows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sexual intercourse with me is </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to you, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">coerces he</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to engage in sexual intercourse with him, as she is duty bound to </span>engage in sexual intercourse with <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>due to his conjugal rights. However, if she vows: <span class="gemarra-regular">The pleasure </span>I derive <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>engaging in <span class="gemarra-regular">sexual intercourse with you is </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me, it is prohibited </span>for them to engage in sexual intercourse, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>she derives pleasure from the sexual intercourse and <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not feed a person that which is forbidden to him. </span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one says: I take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sleep</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">That I will not speak, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">That I will not walk, </span>this activity is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>to him. As taught earlier (10a), one of the primary methods of taking a vow is by invoking an offering. The mishna provides several examples where invoking the term <span class="it-text">korban</span> is not effective. If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">An offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">korban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] that I will not eat of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">yours</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">This offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ha</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">korban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] that I will eat of yours, </span>or: That which <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not eat of yours </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not an offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">la</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">korban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the food is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. </span>

Daf 16a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose</span> opinion is expressed in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna? It is </span>apparently the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir. As, if </span>it is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, </span>there is a contradiction, because <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not differentiate </span>whether one takes a vow by saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">An offering, and he does not differentiate </span>whether he takes a vow by saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">This offering. </span>In both cases the vow does not take effect, as he did not use the phrase: Like an offering. The mishna, by contrast, indicates that only a vow that is phrased: An offering that I will not eat of yours, or: This offering that I will eat of yours, does not take effect. If it is phrased: An offering I will eat of yours, it takes effect, as it indicates that his eating will be like an offering. 
The Gemara continues its analysis: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say the latter clause </span>of the mishna: If he says: That which <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not eat of yours </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not an offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the food is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (13a) that if one said: That which <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not eat of yours </span>will be <span class="gemarra-regular">for an offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lekorban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], Rabbi Meir forbids </span>the food to him? <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is rendered as one who says: </span>Your food <span class="gemarra-regular">will be </span>to me <span class="gemarra-regular">for an offering; therefore, I will not eat of yours. </span>The mishna appears to be incompatible with the opinion of Rabbi Meir as well. 
The Gemara answers that this is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. That </span>mishna is referring to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who said: For an offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lekorban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>and the vow therefore takes effect. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>mishna is referring to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who said: Not for an offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">la</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lekorban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">he is saying that it should not be an offering, </span>and therefore the vow does not take effect.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">An oath </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not eat of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">yours</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will eat of yours [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">she’okhal</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lekha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Not an oath that I will not eat of yours, </span>the food <span class="gemarra-regular">is forbidden.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">By inference </span>from the mishna, it may be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is an oath that I will eat of yours, indicates that I will not eat. And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shevuot</span> 19b): There are <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>basic types of <span class="gemarra-regular">oaths that are </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">four</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> An oath <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will eat, and: That I will not eat; </span>an oath <span class="gemarra-regular">that I ate, and: That I did not eat. From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">states: </span>That I will eat, in contradistinction to: <span class="gemarra-regular">That I will not eat; that I ate, and </span>in contradistinction: <span class="gemarra-regular">That I did not eat,</span> it may be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that </span>an oath <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will eat of yours [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">she’okhal</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lekha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] indicates: </span>An oath <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will eat. </span>This contradicts our mishna. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>The phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">That I will eat [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">she’okhal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], indicates two expressions</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> depending on the context in which it is used. How so? If <span class="gemarra-regular">they were importuning [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mesarevin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him to eat, and he said: I will eat, I will eat, and </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">furthermore </span>said: <span class="gemarra-regular">An oath that I will eat [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">she’okhal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], it indicates: That I will eat. However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: I will not eat, I will not eat, and he furthermore said: An oath that I will eat [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">she’okhal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], he is saying: That I will not eat. </span>The oath is intended to reinforce his refusal to eat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said </span>that the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">That I will eat [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">she’okhal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>cited in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an oath, is </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">saying </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: That I will not eat [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">she’i</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">okhal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>the prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious, </span>as he explicitly took an oath not to eat. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">of stating </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he blundered </span>in properly <span class="gemarra-regular">upholding the wording</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he mispronounced the vow, as his intention was to say: An oath that I will eat [<span class="it-text">she’okhal</span>], the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that he meant that he will not eat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye did not state </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">reason </span>for the ruling of the mishna that was stated <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rav Ashi, as </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">does not teach </span>the case of: <span class="gemarra-regular">That I will not eat [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">she’i</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">okhal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>Rather, it teaches the case of that I will eat [<span class="it-text">she’okhal</span>]. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Ashi turned away [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nadei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the reason that Abaye </span>stated, because <span class="gemarra-regular">he held </span>that the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">That I will not eat, also indicates two expressions, </span>depending on the context. For example, if <span class="gemarra-regular">they were importuning him to eat and he said: I will not eat, I will not eat, and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">said: An oath, </span>then, in this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>the wording of the oath was: <span class="gemarra-regular">That I will eat, or: That I will not eat, this </span>expression <span class="gemarra-regular">indicates that he is saying: I will eat. </span>The statement: An oath that I will not eat, should be interpreted rhetorically in this context: Did I take an oath that I will not eat? Certainly I did not, as I will eat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And there is also </span>a way <span class="gemarra-regular">to interpret the expression: An oath that I will not eat, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">indicating </span>its straightforward meaning, i.e., that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">saying: An oath that I will not eat. </span>Therefore, the mishna cannot be interpreted in this manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> in tractate <span class="it-text">Shevuot</span> clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">established a principle: That I will eat, indicates that I will eat, and: That I will not eat, indicates I will not eat. </span>Therefore, the correct version of the mishna must be: That I will not eat [<span class="it-text">she’i</span> <span class="it-text">okhal</span>].
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>rule, that oaths can render actions, which do not have actual substance, either prohibited or obligatory, <span class="gemarra-regular">is a stringency of oaths vis-à-vis vows, </span>which do not take effect with regard to matters that do not have actual substance. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there is also <span class="gemarra-regular">a stringency of vows vis-à-vis </span><span class="gemarra-regular">oaths</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>With regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Making a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Taking a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">lulav</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span><span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Donning phylacteries is </span><span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me, in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">vows, </span>the items are rendered <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden, </span>and he may not perform the mitzva until the vow is dissolved. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of similar <span class="gemarra-regular">oaths, </span>these items are <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted, as one cannot take an oath to transgress the mitzvot.</span> 

Daf 16b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It is stated in the mishna: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stringency </span>of oaths vis-à-vis vows. The Gemara presumes that the mishna is referring to the distinction stated in previous <span class="it-text">mishnayot</span> between saying: An offering that I will not eat of yours, and saying: An oath that I will not eat of yours. The Gemara asks: Should it be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the statement: An offering that I will not eat of yours, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">vo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> by rabbinic law, and it is merely less stringent than the corresponding oath, which takes effect by Torah law? <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for him to eat, implying that the vow does not take effect at all? 
The Gemara answers: This <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught with regard to the latter clause of the other section.</span> As opposed to a vow that is taken with regard to a matter that does not have actual substance, which takes effect only by rabbinic law, as articulated in the mishna (14b) and Gemara (15a), the subsequent mishna (15b) teaches that if someone says: <span class="gemarra-regular">An oath that I will not sleep, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">That I will not speak, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">That I will not walk, </span>this activity is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>to him. It is concerning this contrast that the mishna says: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is a stringency of oaths vis-à-vis vows.</span>
§ It is stated in the mishna that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a stringency of vows vis-à-vis oaths. How so? </span>Whereas a vow can override a mitzva, an oath cannot. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Giddel said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said, and Rav Tavyumei teaches </span>the same statement with a different attribution, i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Giddel said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span>said: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that one cannot take an oath to transgress the mitzvot? The verse states: “He shall not profane his word” </span>(Numbers 30:3). It is inferred that <span class="gemarra-regular">his word, </span>i.e., the prohibition he accepted upon himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">he shall not profane. However, he may profane </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for the desires of Heaven. </span>If he took an oath to act against the will of God, the oath does not take effect. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">a vow </span>that enables it to override mitzvot? Granted, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written </span>in the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“When a man takes a vow to the Lord…he shall not profane his word” </span>(Numbers 30:3), which indicates that even with regard to matters that pertain to the Lord, i.e., mitzvot, one shall not profane his word, as the vow takes effect. However, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath it is also written </span>in the same verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Or swears an oath” to God, “he shall not profane his word.” </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>The distinction is not between oaths and vows per se, but rather between the phraseology in each case. How so? <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>case, in which the prohibition overrides the mitzva, is referring to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who said: The benefit </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> is hereby forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since the vow renders the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> a forbidden object, it takes effect and overrides the mitzva, as one may not be fed what is forbidden to him, even if it is forbidden only to him. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, in which the prohibition does not take effect, is referring to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who said: </span>I hereby take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will not derive benefit from the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The oath does not take effect, as one is not entitled to take an oath to abstain from an act that he is obligated to perform.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>in objection to the explanation of Abaye: <span class="gemarra-regular">But were mitzvot given for </span>the purpose of <span class="gemarra-regular">deriving benefit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The performance of mitzvot is not considered benefit. Why then would performance of the mitzva with the <span class="it-text">sukka</span> be considered deriving benefit? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said </span>a different explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>case is referring to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who said: Dwelling in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span> is hereby prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">to me, and that </span>case is referring to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who said: </span>I hereby take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will not dwell in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sukka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
§ The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is the principle <span class="gemarra-regular">that one cannot take an oath to transgress the mitzvo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> derived from here, </span>i.e., the above verse? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is derived from there, </span>i.e., another verse, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that if one <span class="gemarra-regular">takes an oath to nullify a mitzva and does not nullify it, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">he will be liable </span>for violating an oath on a statement. 

Daf 17a

However, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: </span>“Or if anyone swears clearly with his lips <span class="gemarra-regular">to do evil, or to do good” </span>(Leviticus 5:4). From the juxtaposition of evil and good it is derived that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as the doing of good,</span> which is interpreted as obligating himself to take a positive action, is referring to a <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>activity, e.g., to eat, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, the doing of evil, </span>which is interpreted as prohibiting himself from something, refers only to that which is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted, </span>e.g., not to eat. This <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">takes an oath to nullify a mitzv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and does not nullify it; </span>he is not liable for violating the oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the permission </span>to nullify it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not in his power. </span>
The Gemara answers that both verses are necessary. <span class="gemarra-regular">One verse: </span>“To do evil or to do good,” which is stated in the context of the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of offerings, is necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">to exempt him from </span>bringing <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering for </span>violating <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath, and one </span>verse: “He shall not profane,” is necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">to exempt him from the prohibition for </span>violating <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> oath.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">There is a vow within a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> It is possible to impose an additional prohibition, by means of a vow, on an item that is already forbidden by means of a vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">But there is no oath within an oath. </span>If one takes an oath twice with regard to the same action, the second oath does not take effect. <span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I am hereby a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nazirit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">if I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and then repeated: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby a nazirite if I eat, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he ate, he is obligated </span>to observe naziriteship for thirty days <span class="gemarra-regular">for each and every one </span>of the vows, as both vows took effect. However, if he said: I hereby take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will not eat, </span>and repeated: I hereby take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he ate, he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is liable </span>to bring an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">for only one </span>violation of an oath. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: They taught </span>that there is a vow within a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">only where he said: I am hereby a nazirite today, </span>and then he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby a nazirite tomorrow. As since an additional day </span>of naziriteship <span class="gemarra-regular">is added </span>by the second vow, an additional thirty-day obligation of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship takes effect upon </span>the first term of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship. However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: I am hereby a nazirite today, </span>and then repeated: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby a nazirite </span><span class="gemarra-regular">today</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a vow of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship does not take effect upon </span>a previous vow of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship, </span>and he must observe only one term of naziriteship. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: I am hereby a nazirite today, I am hereby a nazirite today, </span>a second vow of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship takes effect with regard to him, </span>as one can apply two obligations of naziriteship to himself one after the other.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to Rav Huna, instead of teaching </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no oath within an oath, </span>drawing a distinction between a vow and an oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>a narrower distinction between different vows, stating that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a vow within a vow, and there is </span>a case in which there is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a vow within a vow. </span>How so? If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby a nazirite today, I am hereby a nazirite tomorrow, </span>in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a vow within a vow. </span>However, if one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby a nazirite today, </span>and then again says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby a nazirite today, </span>

Daf 17b

in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no vow within a vow. </span>The Gemara concludes: This question is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult, </span>although it is not a conclusive refutation.
The Gemara raises several problems with the opinion of Rav Huna. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is a vow within a vow, but there is no oath within an oath. What are the circumstances? If we say </span>that the case of a vow within a vow is <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span> one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I am hereby a nazirite today, I am a hereby a nazirite tomorrow, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in the corresponding </span>situation <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an oath </span>within an oath, which will not take effect, is where one said: I hereby take an oath <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will not eat figs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he then said: </span>I hereby take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will not eat grapes, </span>i.e., he took two separate oaths; if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">why does an </span>additional <span class="gemarra-regular">oath not take effect </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath </span>was already made? It ought to take effect, as the second oath is not connected to the first one. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what are the circumstances in which </span>a second <span class="gemarra-regular">oath does not take effect </span>after <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath </span>was already made? <span class="gemarra-regular">For example, where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>I hereby take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will not eat figs, and he again said: </span>I hereby take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will not eat figs. In the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> corresponding </span>situation <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to naziriteship, what are the circumstances? </span>It must be a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I am hereby a nazirite today, I am a hereby a nazirite </span><span class="gemarra-regular">today; and </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">there is a vow within a vow. </span>This poses <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> difficulty to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna, </span>who holds that in this case the second vow does not take effect.
The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna </span>is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I am hereby a nazirite today, I am hereby a nazirite tomorrow; </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in the corresponding </span>situation <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an oath </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>I hereby take an oath <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will not eat figs, and then said: </span>I hereby take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will not eat figs and grapes, </span>the second oath <span class="gemarra-regular">does not take effect, </span>as he had already taken an oath with regard to part of its content.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Rabba say </span>that if one said: I hereby take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will not eat figs, and then </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>I hereby take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will not eat figs and grapes, and he </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">ate figs, </span>violating the oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">set aside an offering </span>for the violation of an oath on a statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he then ate grapes, </span>in this case the <span class="gemarra-regular">grapes </span>that he ate <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">a half-measure </span>of the second oath. The inclusion of both figs and grapes in the oath indicates that his intention was to prohibit himself from eating both. Since he already set aside an offering for eating the figs, he is now considered as having eaten only grapes and as having violated only half of the oath. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore he is not liable to bring an offering for violating the second oath, as <span class="gemarra-regular">one does not bring an offering for a half-measure. </span>
The fact that he is exempt from bringing an offering merely because he ate a half-measure indicates that the second oath took effect. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>I hereby take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will not eat figs, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> then said: </span>I hereby take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will not eat figs and grapes, since the </span>second <span class="gemarra-regular">oath </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">take effect with regard to grapes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as grapes were not included in the first oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">it takes effect with regard to figs as well. </span>This poses a problem according to the opinion of Rav Huna, who would explain the mishna as teaching that the second oath in this case does not take effect at all. The Gemara answers: This is not a problem. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna does not hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, </span>as Rabba was an <span class="it-text">amora</span> and Rav Huna’s student.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who took two </span>vows of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship, counted the </span>thirty days of the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>term of naziriteship <span class="gemarra-regular">and set aside an offering </span>at the end of its term, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">requested </span>from a halakhic authority <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>dissolution of the vow before the offering was sacrificed, thereby rendering the offering unnecessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>term of naziriteship <span class="gemarra-regular">is counted for him instead of the first</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> He is considered as having fulfilled the second term of naziriteship during the period in which he observed the first one. Therefore, the offering that he set aside counts for the second term of naziriteship. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? If we say that </span>it is a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: I am hereby a nazirite today, I am hereby a nazirite tomorrow, why is the second </span>term of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship counted for him instead of the first? Isn’t there an additional day</span> in the second term of naziriteship that he has not yet observed, as the second thirty day term commences the day after the first thirty day period had commenced? How, then, is it possible that the second obligation was fulfilled through his observance of the first one? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious that </span>it is a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: I am hereby a nazirite today, I am hereby a nazirite today, </span>

Daf 18a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation </span>of the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Huna.</span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, actually </span>the case is where he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby a nazirite today, I am hereby </span>a nazirite <span class="gemarra-regular">tomorrow. And what </span>is the meaning of the statement: The second term of naziriteship <span class="gemarra-regular">is counted for him </span>instead of the first? It is counted <span class="gemarra-regular">except for that additional day, </span>which he still must observe. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>it may be a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he accepted </span>upon himself <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>periods of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> simultaneously, </span>i.e., he said: I am hereby a nazirite twice. Therefore, when the vow with regard to the first term of naziriteship is dissolved, the days he observed count entirely for his second term. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna raised </span>an additional <span class="gemarra-regular">objection </span>against the opinion of Rav Huna from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. It is stated in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“A nazirite, to consecrate [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nazir</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lehazzir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Numbers 6:2). <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the use of similar, repetitive wording in the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>it is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that naziriteship takes effect upon </span>a prior vow of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship. As </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that it could be derived through an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">inference </span>that naziriteship does not take effect, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">And just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath, </span>which is more <span class="gemarra-regular">stringent,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> an oath does not take effect upon </span>a prior <span class="gemarra-regular">oath, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship, </span>which is more <span class="gemarra-regular">lenient, all the more so </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>clear that it does not take effect where a vow of naziriteship was already in effect? Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Nazir</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lehazzir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.” From here </span>it is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that naziriteship takes effect upon </span>a prior vow of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? If we say </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I am hereby a nazirite today, I am hereby a nazirite tomorrow, does that </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">require </span>proof from <span class="gemarra-regular">a verse </span>that it takes effect? It is obvious that the second vow of naziriteship takes effect at least on the additional day. And as the minimum term of naziriteship is thirty days, an additional thirty days must be observed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I am a nazirite today, I am a nazirite today? And </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that in this case as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship takes effect upon </span>a prior vow of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship, </span>contrary to the opinion of Rav Huna.
The Gemara answers: That is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the case. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">with what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he accepted upon himself two </span>terms of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship simultaneously. </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches that he must observe two terms of naziriteship and bring a separate offering for each. 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> stated that an oath is more stringent than a vow. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what is the stringency of an oath vis-à-vis a vow,</span> such as a vow of naziriteship? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> posits this <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>an oath, unlike a vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">takes effect even with regard to a matter that has no actual </span>substance, there is a counterargument that <span class="gemarra-regular">a vow also has stringency </span>vis-à-vis an oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">in that it, </span>unlike an oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">takes effect with regard to a mitzva just as </span>it does with regard to a matter that is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rather, </span>oaths are more stringent <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is written with regard to an oath: “The Lord will not hold guiltless </span>he who takes His name in vain” (Exodus 20:6). 
§ It is taught in the mishna that if one said: I hereby take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will not eat, </span>I hereby take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will not eat, and he </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">ate, he is liable </span>to bring an offering for <span class="gemarra-regular">only one </span>violation of an oath. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: If he requested </span>and received dissolution from a halakhic authority <span class="gemarra-regular">for the first </span>oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>oath <span class="gemarra-regular">takes effect upon him. From where </span>is this derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is not taught </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is only one, </span>i.e., it is as though he took only one oath as the oaths are identical. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, it is taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is liable for only one. </span>Evidently, he is not liable for the second oath only because it <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have a span </span>of time in which to take effect, as he is already under oath not to eat. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">when he requests </span>dissolution of <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>oath, i.e. the first oath, the second oath has a span of time in which to take effect, and <span class="gemarra-regular">takes effect.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Another version </span>of Rava’s proof from the mishna is that it may be inferred from the statement: He is liable for only one, that although <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no liability </span>to bring an offering for violating the second oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is </span>an effective <span class="gemarra-regular">oath. </span>But if there is no liability, then <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is it effective? Certainly it is effective <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava, as Rava said: If he requested </span>and received dissolution from a halakhic authority <span class="gemarra-regular">for the first </span>oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">the second is counted for him in its place.</span>
The Gemara proposes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the following mishna (<span class="it-text">Shevuot</span> 27b) <span class="gemarra-regular">supports his </span>opinion: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who took two </span>vows of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship, and counted the first </span>term, <span class="gemarra-regular">and set aside an offering, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">requested </span>and received dissolution from a halakhic authority <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the first oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">the second </span>term <span class="gemarra-regular">counts for him instead of the first. </span>Evidently, although initially the second term of naziriteship did not have a span of time in which to take effect, it was not completely void. Therefore, when the first vow was dissolved, the second one immediately took its place. It may be proved from here that this is true with regard to oaths as well.
The Gemara refutes this proof: That mishna may be referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he accepted upon himself two </span>terms of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship simultaneously. </span>Since two terms cannot be observed concurrently, when he accepts two terms simultaneously, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that the second term commences immediately following the close of the first, which immediately took effect upon sequential periods of time. However, when one takes an oath prohibiting himself from a matter that is already prohibited by an oath in the same period of time, the second oath may not take effect at all. 

Daf 18b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Unspecified vows </span>are treated <span class="gemarra-regular">stringently</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but their specification, </span>if specification is necessary, is treated <span class="gemarra-regular">leniently. How so? </span>If one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: This</span> item is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">to me like salted meat, </span>or: This item is prohibited to me <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">wine </span>used for <span class="gemarra-regular">libations, if he vowed in reference to </span>meat or libations <span class="gemarra-regular">of a peace-offering, </span>i.e., if he claimed that his intention was that the item will be forbidden to him like the salted meat of an offering, or like wine that is used for libations on the altar, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden, </span>as he associated the item of the vow with an item forbidden by means of a vow, i.e., the offering. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he claims that <span class="gemarra-regular">he vowed in reference to </span>meat or libations <span class="gemarra-regular">of idol worship, </span>i.e., that the item will be like the salted meat of an offering for an idol, or like wine that is used for libations as idol worship, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted, </span>as the item of the vow was associated with an item forbidden by the Torah. By enabling the one who took the vow to later clarify his intent, the vow is treated leniently. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the vow was <span class="gemarra-regular">without</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> specification, </span>i.e., the one who took the vow did not specify whether his intention was to associate the item with an offering for Heaven or to associate the item with idol worship, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
Similarly, if one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>item is <span class="gemarra-regular">hereby </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>like an item dedicated to the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>his intention was that it would be <span class="gemarra-regular">like a dedication to Heaven, </span>which is a form of consecration, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is forbidden. And if </span>his intention was that it would be <span class="gemarra-regular">like a dedication to priests, </span>whereby one pledges his asset as a gift to priests, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted, </span>as this type of gift is not forbidden at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>he said it <span class="gemarra-regular">without specification, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden. </span>
Likewise, if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>item <span class="gemarra-regular">is hereby </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me like tithes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if he took a vow </span>with the intention that it would be <span class="gemarra-regular">like the animal tithe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden, </span>as the item of the vow was associated with an item forbidden by a vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if </span>his intention was that it will be like the tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">of the granary</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., grain that is given to the Levites and has no sanctity, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And if </span>he said it <span class="gemarra-regular">without specification, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden. </span>
Similarly, if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>item <span class="gemarra-regular">is hereby </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me like </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if he took a vow </span>with the intention that it would be <span class="gemarra-regular">like the collection of the </span>Temple treasury <span class="gemarra-regular">chamber [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">terumat</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halishka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is a tax for the communal offerings, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden, </span>his vow was associated with an item forbidden by a vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>his intention was that it would be like <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of the granary </span>that is given to the priests, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted, </span>as <span class="it-text">teruma</span> is not an item forbidden by a vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>the vow was taken <span class="gemarra-regular">without specification, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: Unspecified </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in Judea is forbidden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> However, <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Galile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is permitted, as the people of the Galilee are unfamiliar with the collection of the chamber. </span>When they say <span class="it-text">teruma</span> they are referring to the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> allotted to the priests, which is familiar to them. Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">unspecified dedications in Judea are permitted, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">in the Galilee they are forbidden, as the people of the Galilee are unfamiliar with dedications </span>allotted <span class="gemarra-regular">to the priests, </span>so when they say dedication they are referring to dedication to Heaven.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara raises a problem with the principle stated in the mishna that unspecified vows are treated stringently. <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn</span> in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Taharot</span> 4:12): <span class="gemarra-regular">Uncertainty </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship </span>is treated <span class="gemarra-regular">leniently</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> And naziriteship is a type of vow. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. That </span>mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who disagree with him. <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who consecrates his undomesticated animal and his domesticated anima</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has consecrated the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ko</span><span class="gemarra-italic">y</span> as well, although it is uncertain whether it is an undomesticated or a domesticated animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: He has not consecrated the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">koy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">The </span>Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">who said </span>that one <span class="gemarra-regular">puts his possessions into </span>a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty, </span>and therefore a <span class="it-text">koy</span> is included in the aforementioned vow, hold that one <span class="gemarra-regular">enters himself into </span>a state of uncertainty <span class="gemarra-regular">as well. </span>Therefore, uncertainty with regard to naziriteship is treated stringently. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Eliezer, <span class="gemarra-regular">who said</span> that one <span class="gemarra-regular">does not put his possessions into </span>a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty, </span>and therefore the phrase: Undomesticated and domesticated animals, refers only to definitely undomesticated and definitely domesticated animals, 

Daf 19a

holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">does not enter himself into uncertainty either. </span>Therefore, uncertainty with regard to naziriteship is treated leniently. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>Rabbi Zeira: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>manner <span class="gemarra-regular">did you establish </span>the mishna that states <span class="gemarra-regular">that uncertainty </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship </span>is treated <span class="gemarra-regular">leniently? </span>You established it <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer. Say the latter clause </span>of that mishna: If there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">firstborns</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whether human firstborns</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or animal firstborns, whether non-kosher </span>firstborns, i.e., the firstborn of a donkey, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>the firstborn of <span class="gemarra-regular">kosher </span>animals, <span class="gemarra-regular">the burden of proof rests upon the claimant. </span>In other words, the priest cannot take the redemption money from the father of the child, or the animal from its owner, and conversely, if the father or owner mistakenly gave it to a priest, he does not get it back. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in that regard:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But with regard to shearing and working </span>these uncertain animal firstborns, they are <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> just like definite firstborns. This indicates a difference between the monetary issue, with regard to which it is ruled that the animal cannot be taken from the owner by the priest, and the prohibition, which applies despite the uncertainty. Evidently, even the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of this mishna does not hold that all uncertainties with regard to consecration are to be treated leniently. 
Rabbi Zeira <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Abaye: This is not difficult. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do you compare sanctity that emerges by itself, </span>i.e., the sanctity of a firstborn, which results from objective reality and not human intent, <span class="gemarra-regular">to sanctity that emerges by </span>the volition of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>and is dependent on his intention? Only with regard to the latter type of sanctity can it be established that a person does not intend to consecrate an item in an uncertain manner.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if </span>Rabbi Zeira’s answer <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult, this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult. </span>It is stated in that same mishna: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">liquid </span>with regard to which there is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertaint</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> whether it became ritually impure through contact with someone who was ritually impure, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is as follows: It is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">impure </span>with regard to its <span class="gemarra-regular">being impure </span>in and of itself, but it is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">pure </span>with regard to its ability <span class="gemarra-regular">to render other </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">impure. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. And Rabbi Elazar would also say in accordance with the statements of</span> Rabbi Meir. 
According to Rabbi Zeira’s assertion that the rulings of this mishna with regard to uncertainty are in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, this causes a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But does Rabbi Eliezer hold </span>that with regard to liquid of uncertain ritual status <span class="gemarra-regular">being impure, it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">impure? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>By Torah law, <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity does not apply to liquids at all? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Know </span>that this is so, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Yosei ben Yo’ezer of Tzereid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> testified concerning </span>a grasshopper species called <span class="gemarra-italic">eil</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">kamtz</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">kosher, and concerning the liquids of the </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughterhouse </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are pure. </span>Liquids are susceptible to ritual impurity only by rabbinic law, and liquids in the Temple were not included in this decree so as not to cause additional impurity there. Since Rabbi Eliezer holds that by Torah law liquids are not susceptible to impurity, how can it be his opinion that liquids of uncertain ritual status are considered impure?
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">This works out well according to Shmuel, who said </span>that the meaning of Rabbi Eliezer’s ruling that the liquids of the Temple slaughterhouse are <span class="gemarra-regular">pure </span>is that they cannot <span class="gemarra-regular">render other </span>items impure, <span class="gemarra-regular">but they themselves are </span>susceptible to <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity. </span>Accordingly, liquids are susceptible to impurity by Torah law; only their ability to render other items impure is by rabbinic law. The ruling in the mishna that liquid of uncertain ritual status is considered impure is therefore consistent with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, and Rabbi Zeira’s answer works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to Rav, who said </span>that they are <span class="gemarra-regular">actually pure, </span>i.e., they are not susceptible to impurity, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is there to say? </span>The mishna that is lenient with regard to uncertain naziriteship and stringent with regard to liquid of uncertain ritual status is clearly not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rabbi Zeira’s answer should be rejected, and the contradiction between the mishna here, which states that unspecified vows should be treated stringently, and the mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Teharot</span>, which states that uncertain naziriteship should be treated leniently, should be resolved as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>mishna, in <span class="it-text">Teharot</span>, is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, and this </span>mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that if someone says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby a nazirite if there are in this hea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> of grain <span class="gemarra-regular">one hundred </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and he went</span> to measure the heap <span class="gemarra-regular">and found that it was stolen or that it was lost </span>and cannot be measured, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda permits </span>him to perform actions forbidden to a nazirite, as he holds that this uncertain naziriteship does not take effect. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shimon prohibits </span>him from doing so, as he maintains that it does take effect. This indicates that Rabbi Shimon is of the opinion that uncertain naziriteship is treated stringently. 
And the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>between the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda and </span>another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yehuda. Did Rabbi Yehuda </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person does not enter himself into </span>a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty, </span>and therefore as long as the volume of the heap is unknown, naziriteship does not take effect? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from the mishna, where <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: Unspecified </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in Judea is forbidden but in the Galilee it is permitted, as the people of the Galilee are not familiar with the collection of the chamber.</span> The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>it is permitted is <span class="gemarra-regular">that they are not familiar; </span>

Daf 19b

<span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">they are familiar, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden, </span>even if the person mentioned <span class="it-text">teruma</span> without specification, and there is still uncertainty with regard to which <span class="it-text">teruma</span> he was referring.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that the contradiction can be resolved as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span>the case of a vow conditioned on the volume of <span class="gemarra-regular">a heap, </span>Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">wherever uncertainty is more stringent than certainty, one does not enter himself into </span>a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty. </span>Uncertain naziriteship is more stringent than definite naziriteship, <span class="gemarra-regular">as while a definite nazirite </span>has a remedy, i.e., at the end of his naziriteship he <span class="gemarra-regular">shaves </span>his hair <span class="gemarra-regular">and brings an offering and it is eaten, one cannot shave </span>his hair <span class="gemarra-regular">for uncertain </span>naziriteship. He cannot bring an offering in case he is not a nazirite, which would render his offering a non-sacred animal in the Temple courtyard. Since he cannot bring an offering he may not shave.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Yehuda said to Rava: </span>According to your answer, that Rabbi Yehuda holds that he is not a nazirite only because uncertain naziriteship is more stringent than definite naziriteship, if one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>If there are a hundred <span class="it-text">kor</span> in this heap <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby a permanent nazirite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? In this case, uncertainty is apparently not more stringent than certainty, as the naziriteship will never end even if it is definite. 
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Even</span> with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a permanent nazirite, his uncertainty is more stringent than certainty </span>with regard to a different <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">the hair of a definite </span>nazirite <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">heavy </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">he may lighten </span>the hair <span class="gemarra-regular">with a razor and bring </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">three animal </span>offerings that a nazirite brings when he has completed his term of naziriteship, before continuing to observe naziriteship; <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas </span>in a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot </span>do so. Since it is not certain that he is a nazirite, he cannot bring these offerings and is therefore prohibited from shaving. Therefore, uncertainty is more stringent than certainty with regard to a permanent nazirite as well.
Rav Huna further asked him: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>If there are one hundred <span class="it-text">kor</span> in this heap, <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby a nazirite like Samson </span>(Judges, chapters 13–16), i.e., he would be like Samson, whose permanent naziriteship could not be dissolved and who had no remedy at all, even by bringing offerings, and therefore could never shave, <span class="gemarra-regular">what</span> is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Uncertainty is definitely not more stringent than certainty in this case. 
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The concept of <span class="gemarra-regular">a nazirite </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">Samson is not taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> It was not mentioned at all by the Sages, as the naziriteship of Samson could not have been created through a vow. It was a one-time, divine order that cannot be emulated. Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But didn’t Rav Adda bar Ahava say </span>that the concept of <span class="gemarra-regular">a nazirite </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">Samson is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, which shows that it takes effect? Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and I cannot take issue with it. Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda acknowledges that in this case even uncertain naziriteship takes effect.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said </span>a different resolution to the contradiction between the statements of Rabbi Yehuda. <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, in which Rabbi Yehuda treats uncertain naziriteship leniently, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda in the name of Rabbi Tarfon. As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If a number of people wager on the truth of a statement, and they stipulate that whoever is correct will be a nazirite, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Tarfon: None of them is a nazirite </span>no matter who is correct, <span class="gemarra-regular">because naziriteship was given </span>to take effect <span class="gemarra-regular">only through explicitness </span>of intent. A vow of naziriteship takes effect only if it is taken unconditionally. Therefore, in the case of the heap, since the speaker was uncertain of its volume at the time the vow of naziriteship was taken, the vow does not take effect. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, why </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the heap <span class="gemarra-regular">was stolen or that it was lost? </span>Even if it was still present and measured, the naziriteship would not have taken effect as it was conditioned and was not a clear expression. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>that detail was established <span class="gemarra-regular">to convey the far-reaching nature </span>of the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Shimon, that even </span>if it is the case <span class="gemarra-regular">that it was stolen or that it was lost </span>and consequently cannot be measured, nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person enters himself into uncertainty, </span>and therefore the vow takes effect.
§ It is stated in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: Unspecified </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in Judea </span>is forbidden, but in the Galilee it is permitted, as the people of the Galilee are unfamiliar with the collection of the Temple treasury chamber. The Gemara infers: Where <span class="gemarra-regular">they are familiar </span>with the collection of the chamber, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden. Apparently, uncertainty </span>with regard to vows <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>treated <span class="gemarra-regular">stringently. </span>
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">say the latter clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Unspecified dedications</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in Judea are permitted, but in the Galilee they are forbidden, because the people of the Galilee are unfamiliar with dedications allotted to the priests. </span>It may be inferred that where <span class="gemarra-regular">they are familiar </span>with dedications allotted to the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">they are permitted, </span>due to the uncertainty. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, uncertainty </span>with regard to vows <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>treated <span class="gemarra-regular">leniently. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: The latter clause is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, </span>not of Rabbi Yehuda, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">unspecified </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in Judea is forbidden. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">unspecified </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dedications</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the Galilee are forbidden. </span>

Daf 20a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who <span class="gemarra-regular">took a vow </span>by associating an item <span class="gemarra-regular">with a dedication [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥerem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> saying: This item is hereby forbidden to me like an item dedicated to the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I took a vow only with </span>the intention that it would be like <span class="gemarra-regular">a sea net [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥermo</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">shel</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">yam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> that is used to catch fish; or one who took a vow by associating an item <span class="gemarra-regular">with an offering, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I took a vow only with </span>reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">offerings to kings, </span>i.e., a gift for a king, not an offering to God.
Or one who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby an offering myself [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">atzmi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I took a vow only with </span>reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">a bone [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">etzem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] that I set aside for myself to vow with, </span>as <span class="it-text">atzmi</span> means both myself and my bone, i.e., he set aside a bone so as to pretend to take a vow upon himself; or one who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Deriving benefit from me is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for my wife, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I took a vow only with regard to my first wife whom I divorced, </span>not with regard to my current wife. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">For all </span>of the above vows, those who took them <span class="gemarra-regular">do not </span>need to <span class="gemarra-regular">request </span>of a halakhic authority to dissolve <span class="gemarra-regular">them, </span>as the speaker interpreted the vows in a manner that caused them not to take effect at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if they requested </span>dissolution, apparently due to their being uncertain of their explanations, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">punishes them and treats them stringently </span>and the vows are not dissolved. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: </span>These vows are not treated stringently. Rather, dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">is broached with them by </span>suggesting <span class="gemarra-regular">a different extenuation, </span>i.e., the halakhic authority suggests extenuating circumstances that undermine the vow but do not pertain to its wording. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we teach them </span>that they should not take this kind of vow in the future, <span class="gemarra-regular">in order that they will not take vows lightly.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">is itself difficult. </span>On the one hand, <span class="gemarra-regular">you said they do not </span>need to <span class="gemarra-regular">request </span>to dissolve <span class="gemarra-regular">them, and then it is taught </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">if they requested </span>dissolution, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">punishes them and treats them stringently, </span>i.e., the vows took effect and the vows are not dissolved. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: All of these </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">do not need a request. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">in what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement said? In </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Torah scholar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who knows that these vows do not take effect, and he obviously did not intend for them to take effect in the first place. <span class="gemarra-regular">How-ever, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an ignoramus who comes to request </span>dissolution of the vow, the court <span class="gemarra-regular">punishes him and treats him stringently.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">treats </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">stringently </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the halakhic authorities <span class="gemarra-regular">do not broach </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with him </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of regret; </span>rather, extenuating circumstances must be found. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, what are the circumstances </span>in which the court <span class="gemarra-regular">punishes </span>him? 
The Gemara answers that the circumstances are <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vowed to be a nazirite and violate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his naziriteship, </span>the halakhic authority <span class="gemarra-regular">does not attend to him </span>to dissolve his vow <span class="gemarra-regular">until he observes </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibitions </span>of naziriteship <span class="gemarra-regular">for the same </span>number of <span class="gemarra-regular">days in which he behaved with permissiveness </span>concerning the restrictions of a nazirite. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei said: In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is this statement, </span>that he must observe naziriteship for a period of time corresponding to his vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">said? </span>It is said <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a short </span>term of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship, </span>which is not longer than the minimum thirty days. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, in </span>the case of a <span class="gemarra-regular">long </span>term of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteshi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is enough for him </span>to observe it for <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty days, </span>even if he violated it for a greater number of days. This explains the punishment mentioned in the mishna: An ignoramus who requests the dissolution of his vow must first observe the vow for a certain period of time. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: Since the Sages say </span>that the halakhic authority <span class="gemarra-regular">does not attend to him, a court that does attend </span>to him and dissolves his vow immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">is not acting properly. Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov says: </span>A halakhic authority who dissolves the vow prematurely <span class="gemarra-regular">is excommunicated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ It is stated in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis say:</span> Dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">is broached with him </span>by suggesting a different <span class="gemarra-regular">extenuation, </span>and he is taught not to take this kind of vow so that he will not take vows lightly. It is <span class="gemarra-regular">taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Never be accustomed to </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">vows</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because ultimately you will </span>disregard them, and you will even <span class="gemarra-regular">abuse oaths</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which are more grave. <span class="gemarra-regular">And do not regularly be around an ignoramus, because ultimately he will feed you untithed produce,</span> as he is not careful to tithe. <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not regularly be by an ignorant priest, because ultimately </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he will feed you </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> due to his close relationship with you, and <span class="it-text">teruma</span> is forbidden to a non-priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">And do not talk extensively with a woman, because ultimately you will come to adultery. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Aḥa, son of Rabbi Yoshiya, says: Anyone who watches women will ultimately come to sin, and anyone who looks at the heel of a woman will have indecent children </span>as a punishment. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">relates to </span>all women, including <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife </span>when she has the status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a menstruating woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: The heel </span>of a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">that is mentioned </span>is not the heel of the foot, but <span class="gemarra-regular">the place of uncleanliness, </span>i.e., the genitalia, and it is called a heel as a euphemism, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is situated opposite the heel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">“That His fear may be upon your faces” </span>(Exodus 20:17); <span class="gemarra-regular">this</span> is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">shame, </span>as shame causes one to blush. <span class="gemarra-regular">“That you not sin” </span>(Exodus 20:17) <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that shame leads to fear of sin. From here </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said: It is a good sign in a person that he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is one who experiences shame. Others say: Any person who experiences shame will not quickly sin, and </span>conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who does not have </span>the capacity to be <span class="gemarra-regular">shamefaced, it is known that his forefathers did not stand at Mount Sinai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Dehava</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: The ministering angels told me four matters: For what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">do lame people come into existence? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>their fathers <span class="gemarra-regular">overturn their tables</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., they engage in sexual intercourse in an atypical way. <span class="gemarra-regular">For what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">do mute people come into existence? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>their fathers <span class="gemarra-regular">kiss that place </span>of nakedness. <span class="gemarra-regular">For what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">do deaf people come into existence? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>their parents <span class="gemarra-regular">convers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> while engaging in sexual intercourse. For what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">do blind people come into existence? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>their fathers <span class="gemarra-regular">stare at that place. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction: Imma Shalom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the wife of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, <span class="gemarra-regular">was asked: For what </span>reason 

Daf 20b

<span class="gemarra-regular">are your children so beautiful? She said to them: </span>My husband <span class="gemarra-regular">does not converse with me </span>while engaging in sexual intercourse, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither at the beginning of the night nor at the end of the night, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">rather at midnight</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And when he converses </span>with me while engaging in sexual intercourse, <span class="gemarra-regular">he reveals a handbreadt</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> of my body <span class="gemarra-regular">and covers a handbreadth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>he covers himself up <span class="gemarra-regular">as though he were being coerced by a demo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> and is covering himself out of fear. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And I said to </span>my husband: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this behavior? <span class="gemarra-regular">And he said to me: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">so that I will not set my eyes on another woman, </span>i.e., think about another woman; if a man thinks about another woman during sexual intercourse with his wife, <span class="gemarra-regular">his children consequently come </span>close <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>receiving <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mamzer</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> status, </span>i.e., the nature of their souls is tantamount to that of a <span class="it-text">mamzer</span>. Therefore I engage in sexual intercourse with you at an hour when there are no people in the street, and in this manner. In any event, it can be seen from her words that a Sage conversed with his wife while engaging in sexual intercourse with her.
The Gemara answers: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span>permission to converse with her is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to matters of sexual intercourse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>restriction of conversation is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to other matters </span>that are not related to sexual intercourse.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: That is the statement of Yoḥanan ben Dehavai. However, the Rabbis said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan ben Dehavai. Rather, whatever a man wishes to d</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with his wife he may do. </span>He may engage in sexual intercourse with her in any manner that he wishes, and need not concern himself with these restrictions. As <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> allegory, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">like meat that comes from the butcher. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he wants to eat it with salt, he may eat it </span>that way. If he wants to eat it <span class="gemarra-regular">roasted, he may eat it </span>roasted. If he wants to eat it <span class="gemarra-regular">cooked, he may eat it </span>cooked. If he wants to eat it <span class="gemarra-regular">boiled, he may eat it </span>boiled. <span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">fish that come from the fisherman.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar said: Who are the ministering angels </span>that Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Dehavai mentioned? He was referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages, </span>for whom he employed the honorary title: Ministering angels. <span class="gemarra-regular">Because if you say </span>that he was referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">actual ministering angels, why did Rabbi Yoḥanan say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Yoḥanan ben Dehavai? </span>The ministering angels <span class="gemarra-regular">are more knowledgeable about the forming of the fetus </span>than people are. Clearly, if the ministering angels were the source for the ruling of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Dehavai it would have been imperative to heed his instructions. <span class="gemarra-regular">And why are </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">called ministering angels? Because they stand out like ministering angels, </span>as they are recognized by their clothing.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">A certain woman, who came before Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi to complain about her husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: My teacher, I set him a table</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> using a euphemism to say that she lay before him during intimacy, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he turned it over</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to her: My daughter, the Torah permitted </span>him to engage in sexual intercourse with <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>even in an atypical manner, <span class="gemarra-regular">and what can I do for you </span>if he does so? Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain woman who came before Rav said to him: My teacher, I set a table for him and he turned it over. He said </span>to her: In <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>this case <span class="gemarra-regular">different from a fish [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">binnita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> that one may eat any way he wishes?
§ The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And that you not go about after your own heart” </span>(Numbers 15:39). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span> that it is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from here </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a man should not drink from this cu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> while setting his eyes on another cup, </span>i.e., one should not engage in sexual intercourse with one woman while thinking about another woman. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: </span>This statement is not necessary with regard to an unrelated woman. Rather, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary only </span>to state <span class="gemarra-regular">that even </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">two wives, </span>he should not engage in sexual intercourse with one while thinking about the other. 
The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and those that transgres</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> against Me” </span>(Ezekiel 20:38). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Levi said: These are children of </span>those who have <span class="gemarra-regular">nine traits</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who are defective from their conception and from whom rebels and transgressors emerge. The mnemonic for these nine traits is <span class="gemarra-regular">children of </span>the acronym <span class="gemarra-italic">aleph</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">samekh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">nun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">shin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">gimmel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ayin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
The children of nine traits are as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Children of fear [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eima</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>i.e., where the wife was afraid of her husband and engaged in sexual intercourse with him out of fear; <span class="gemarra-regular">children of a woman who was raped [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">anusa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> children of a hated woman [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">senua</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>i.e., a woman who was hated by her husband; <span class="gemarra-regular">children of ostracism [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">niddui</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., one of the parents was ostracized by the court; <span class="gemarra-regular">children of substitution [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">temura</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>i.e., while engaging in intercourse with the woman, the man thought that she was another woman; <span class="gemarra-regular">children of strife [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">meriva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the parents engaged in intercourse while they were quarreling; <span class="gemarra-regular">children of drunkenness [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shikhrut</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>i.e., the parents engaged in intercourse while they were drunk; <span class="gemarra-regular">children of a woman who was divorced in the heart [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gerushat</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>i.e., the husband had already decided to divorce her when they engaged in intercourse; <span class="gemarra-regular">children of mixture [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">irbuveya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the man did not know with which woman he was engaging in intercourse; <span class="gemarra-regular">children of a shameless woman [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥatzufa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>who demands of her husband that he engage in intercourse with her.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan said: Any man whose wife demands of him </span>that he engage in sexual intercourse with her <span class="gemarra-regular">will have children the likes of whom did not exist even in the generation of Moses our teacher? As it is stated: “Get you wise men, and understanding, </span>and well known from each one of your tribes, and I will make them head over you” (Deuteronomy 1:13); <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written </span>subsequently: <span class="gemarra-regular">“So I took the heads of your tribes, </span>wise men, and well known” (Deuteronomy 1:15). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it does not say </span>that they were <span class="gemarra-regular">understanding. </span>Evidently, even Moses could not find understanding men in his generation. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>by contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “Issachar is a large-boned donkey” </span>(Genesis 49:14). The Sages transmitted a tradition that this is an allusion to the incident when Jacob came in from the field riding on a donkey, and Leah went out to greet him, saying: “You must come in to me; for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes” (Genesis 30:16). Issachar was conceived from their subsequent sexual intercourse. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written: “And of the children of Issachar, men that had understanding of the times” </span>(I Chronicles 12:33). The descendants of Issachar were understanding men. It is derived from here that a woman who demands from her husband that he engage in sexual intercourse with her has a positive effect on their children. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is not referring to a woman who demands intercourse explicitly, but rather to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who entice</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> her husband, so that he understands that she wants to engage in sexual intercourse with him. They consequently have excellent children.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages dissolved four </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> without the requirement of a request to a halakhic authority: <span class="gemarra-regular">Vows of exhortation, vows of exaggeration, vows that are unintentional, and vows </span>whose fulfillment is impeded by <span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances beyond </span>one’s<span class="gemarra-regular"> control. </span>The mishna explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Vows of exhortation </span>are those by which one encourages another using vow terminology that is exaggerated. <span class="gemarra-regular">How so? One was </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sellin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">an item and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not lower </span>the price <span class="gemarra-regular">for you </span>to less <span class="gemarra-regular">than a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">that is</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">as if </span>it were <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering, </span>for me. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the other one,</span> the buyer, <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I will not raise </span>my payment <span class="gemarra-regular">to you </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">more than a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">shekel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as <span class="gemarra-regular">that is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me. 

Daf 21a

In this case, one may assume that <span class="gemarra-regular">both want </span>to complete the deal <span class="gemarra-regular">at three dinars</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and they did not intend to vow but only exaggerated for purposes of bargaining.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages dissolved four </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">vows. Rabbi Abba bar Memel said to Rabbi Ami: You said to us in the name of Rabbi Yehuda Nesia: Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>this mishna of <span class="gemarra-regular">four vows? It </span>is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda, who said in the name of Rabbi Tarfon: </span>With regard to two people who entered into a wager, and each declared that he would become a nazirite if the other was right, then <span class="gemarra-regular">actually neither of them </span>becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">a nazirite, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">because naziriteship is determined only by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">explicitnes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> of intent. One cannot become a nazirite unless he vows clearly and with certitude. Here too, since the intent of the wagering parties was not actually to vow, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that the vow is invalid.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: You </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">even say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda. <span class="gemarra-regular">Does </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: Both wanted </span>the price to be three dinars? <span class="gemarra-regular">It teaches: Both want, </span>in the present tense, demonstrating that they would have been satisfied with that price from the outset and never intended to vow, so the vow is not binding. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</span> If the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the buyer in the form of a vow that the price must remain <span class="gemarra-regular">more than a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the other </span>declared in the form of a vow that the price must remain <span class="gemarra-regular">less than a shekel,</span> what is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this a vow, </span>where each stands firmly in his position? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or </span>perhaps this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>also merely for <span class="gemarra-regular">encouragement? </span>
Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: We</span> already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span>about a similar case: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">was importuning anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that he should eat with him </span>and the other refused <span class="gemarra-regular">and said to him: Entering your house is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">A drop of cold </span>water is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will not <span class="gemarra-regular">taste </span>it with you, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to enter his house and drink cold </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">since he intended it </span>as a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">only for the purpose of eating and drinking </span>a large amount but did not mean literally that he would not drink anything. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And why </span>is this permitted? <span class="gemarra-regular">But he said: A drop of cold </span>water, so how can you say that the vow is only with regard to drinking a large amount? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person speaks this wa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> in exaggerated terms but does not mean literally what he says. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here also, </span>in the case of the buyer and seller, <span class="gemarra-regular">a person speaks this way. </span>He exaggerates and does not intend the literal meaning of his words, even though he was quite precise in his wording. 
Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>

Daf 21b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Are </span>these cases <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable? Concerning </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">cold </span>water, the <span class="gemarra-regular">righteous say little and do much. </span>Therefore, when the host says to the other: Enter my house and drink a drop of cold water, he intended to offer him an entire meal. So too, the one who vows is referring to an entire meal and not literally to a drop of water. Therefore, he may drink a bit of cold water in the host’s house. 
But <span class="gemarra-regular">here it is uncertain. Perhaps </span>when the seller <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>he will only accept more than a <span class="it-text">sela</span>, he really intends to accept <span class="gemarra-regular">less than a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sela</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span>when the buyer says he will not pay more than a shekel, he really intends to pay <span class="gemarra-regular">more than a shekel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">an exhortation </span>vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or, perhaps he meant specifically </span>what he said, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is a vow, </span>because he did not intend to compromise on the price. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">The dilemma remains </span>unresolved. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi said: These four vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that are taught in the mishna still <span class="gemarra-regular">require a request </span>made <span class="gemarra-regular">to a halakhic authorit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> to dissolve them. Rav Yehuda continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">When I said </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before Shmuel, he said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages dissolved four vows, and you say they require a request </span>made <span class="gemarra-regular">to a halakhic authority? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef taught this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in this manner: Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi said: A halakhic authority is able to dissolve only </span>a vow that is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to these four vows </span>in that it was not intended to be a vow at all but was simply expressed in the language of a vow. In addition, he can dissolve a vow taken by mistake. The Gemara comments: It can be derived from here that <span class="gemarra-regular">he holds that </span>a halakhic authority <span class="gemarra-regular">does not broach </span>dissolution based <span class="gemarra-regular">on regret</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> A halakhic authority must search for a factor that, had the one making the vow been aware of it at the time of the vow, he would not have vowed. Simply expressing regret about the vow is an insufficient basis on which to dissolve it. 
The Gemara relates an incident that illustrates a different opinion concerning broaching dissolution based on regret. There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Huna </span>to request dissolution of a vow. Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Is your heart upon you?</span> Do you still have the same desire that you had when you made the vow? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: No. And </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">dissolved </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since Rav Huna dissolved the vow based on regret alone, he evidently holds that one may broach dissolution based on regret. 
Similarly, there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who came before Rabba bar Rav Huna </span>to dissolve his vow. Rabba bar Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Had there been ten peopl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">appeased you at the time </span>you vowed, <span class="gemarra-regular">would you have made the vow? He said to him: No. And he dissolved </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for him.</span>
It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>The halakhic authorities who dissolve the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">say to the person </span>who vowed: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this heart, </span>i.e., this desire, still <span class="gemarra-regular">upon you? If he says no, they dissolve it. Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, says in the name of his father: They say to the person </span>who vowed: <span class="gemarra-regular">Had there been ten people who </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">appeased you at the time, would you have made the vow? If he says no, they dissolve it.</span>
The Gemara prefaces the next discussion with <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> mnemonic </span>device: <span class="gemarra-regular">Asi and Elazar, Yoḥanan and Yannai.</span>
The Gemara relates that there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain</span> person <span class="gemarra-regular">who came before Rabbi Asi </span>to request dissolution of a vow. Rabbi Asi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Do you have regret? He said to him </span>rhetorically: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>do I not have regret? In other words, certainly I have regret. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he dissolved </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for him. </span>Similarly, there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who came before Rabbi Elazar, </span>and Rabbi Elazar <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Did you want to vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Was this really your desire? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to </span>Rabbi Elazar: <span class="gemarra-regular">If they had not angered me, I would not have wanted anything. He said to him: Let it be like you want,</span> and the vow is dissolved. In another instance, there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain woman who took a vow with regard to her daughter </span>that the daughter may not benefit from her, and she <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Yoḥanan </span>to dissolve the vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to her: Had you known that your neighbors would say about your daughter: </span>

Daf 22a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Had her mother not seen inappropriate [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aziva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> matters </span>or behavior <span class="gemarra-regular">in her </span>that should be stopped, <span class="gemarra-regular">she would not have taken a vow with regard to her for nothing; </span>had you known that the neighbors would say that, <span class="gemarra-regular">would you have taken a vow with regard to her? She said to him: No, and he dissolved </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for her.</span>
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">The son of the daughter of Rabbi Yannai the Elder came before Rabbi Yannai the Elder </span>to dissolve a vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: Had you known that</span> when you make a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">they open your record book </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pinekas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> in heaven <span class="gemarra-regular">and examine your actions, would you have vowed? He said to him: No, and he dissolved </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for him. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said: What is the verse </span>from which it is derived that taking a vow leads to one’s deeds being examined? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">“And after vows to make inquiry” </span>(Proverbs 20:25). This is interpreted to mean that after one takes a vow, his actions are reviewed in heaven. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And although Rabbi Yannai broached </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with him </span>in this way, <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not broach </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>manner <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>one who vows, by asking if he regrets it because his actions will be examined in heaven. This is because one might be embarrassed, upon hearing such a question, to say that he does not have regret, and he will claim untruthfully that he is regretful. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">do not broach </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">in this other </span>way, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabba bar bar Ḥana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What </span>type of dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">did Rabban Gamliel broach for a certain elderly man </span>who had taken a vow and came before him for dissolution? He informed him that it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“There is one who speaks like the piercing of a sword, but the tongue of the wise is health” </span>(Proverbs 12:18), which is interpreted to mean: <span class="gemarra-regular">Anyone who verbally expresses </span>the language of a vow, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">appropriate to pierce him with a sword, but </span>he has another option: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The tongue of the wise is health,” </span>since the Sages can release him from his vow. Quoting this verse with its interpretation is also not an acceptable method of broaching dissolution.
<span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">do not broach </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">using this other </span>method, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan says: One who vows </span>is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as if he built </span>a personal <span class="gemarra-regular">alta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> outside the Temple, which is prohibited, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who fulfills </span>this vow is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as if he sacrifices an offering on it. With the first clause, we may broach </span>dissolution by informing the one who vowed that vowing is akin to building an altar outside the Temple, but with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>there is a dispute among the Sages. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: We do broach </span>dissolution by telling someone that fulfilling a vow is like sacrificing an offering on a forbidden altar, while <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: We do not broach </span>dissolution with it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana taught this</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in this wording, </span>i.e., the wording that was just cited. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Tavyumei taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">this way: </span>With regard to what is written <span class="gemarra-regular">in the last clause, </span>all agree that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not broach </span>dissolution in this way. With regard to what is written <span class="gemarra-regular">in the first clause, </span>there is a dispute among the Sages. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: We do broach </span>dissolution in this manner, while <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: We do not broach dissolution </span>in this manner either. The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we do not broach </span>dissolution using <span class="gemarra-regular">either </span>the language <span class="gemarra-regular">in the first clause or </span>the language <span class="gemarra-regular">in the latter clause. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">we also do not broach </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with this </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel, as Shmuel said: </span>With regard to one who vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">although he fulfills it, he is called wicked. Rabbi Abbahu said: What is the verse </span>from which this is derived? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">“But if you refrain [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">teḥdal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] from vowing there will be no sin in you” </span>(Deuteronomy 23:23), <span class="gemarra-regular">and he derives </span>the word <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥadala</span> here from the word <span class="gemarra-italic">ḥadala</span> elsewhere. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is written here: “But if you refrain [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">teḥdal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] from vowing,” and it is written there: “There the wicked cease [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥadlu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] from troubling” </span>(Job 3:17). The parallel language demonstrates that vowing is an act of the wicked. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: We, too, learn </span>in the mishna (9a): If one says he vows <span class="gemarra-regular">like the vows of the virtuous, he has not said anything. </span>If he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Like the vows of the wicked, he has vowed with regard to</span> becoming <span class="gemarra-regular">a nazirite, or with regard to </span>obligating himself in <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering, or with regard to </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath. </span>From here it is also apparent that vowing is an act of the wicked.
§ Apropos the verse “There the wicked cease from troubling,” the Gemara cites a related statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan said: Anyone who gets angry, all kinds of Gehenna rule over him, </span>because anger causes him to transgress all kinds of severe sins, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated: “Therefore remove vexation from your heart and put away evil from your flesh” </span>(Ecclesiastes 11:10), <span class="gemarra-regular">and the evil </span>mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">is nothing other than Gehenna, as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it is stated: “The Lord has made everything for His own purpose and even the wicked for the day of evil” </span>(Proverbs 16:4), which is interpreted to mean that ultimately the day of the evildoer in Gehenna will arrive. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And not only that, but </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">hemorrhoids will control him, as it is stated: “But the Lord shall give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and languishing of soul” </span>(Deuteronomy 28:65). <span class="gemarra-regular">Which </span>is the <span class="gemarra-regular">matter </span>of sickness <span class="gemarra-regular">that causes failing of the eyes </span>in pain <span class="gemarra-regular">and causes languishing of the soul? You must say this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">hemorrhoids.</span>
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on his ascent to Eretz Yisrael, had two residents of Ḥoza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> join him. </span>Because of a brawl between them, <span class="gemarra-regular">one arose </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered the other. </span>The assailant <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Ulla: Did I act properly? He said to him: Yes, and open the place of the slaughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., cut it more so that he will die faster. <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>Ulla <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>Ulla <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Perhaps, Heaven forbid, I strengthened the hands of sinners </span>by commending him, although I did so merely because I was afraid that he would kill me. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: You saved yourself </span>by doing so, as it is permitted for one to say words like this in order to save his own life. 
With regard to the narrative itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan wondered: Now, it is written </span>in the passage of curses: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But the Lord shall give you there a trembling heart” </span>(Deuteronomy 28:65) and this <span class="gemarra-regular">is written with regard to Babylonia, </span>because in the exile an individual possesses a trembling and angry heart. How is it possible that in Eretz Yisrael a person can get so angry as to murder another? Ulla <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: At that moment </span>when the incident occurred

Daf 22b

<span class="gemarra-regular">we had not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">crossed the Jordan River, </span>and we were still outside of Eretz Yisrael. Therefore, the curse of a heart of anger was relevant.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna said: Anyone who gets angry, </span>at that moment <span class="gemarra-regular">even the Divine Presence is not important to him, as it is stated: “The wicked, in the height of his anger says: He will not require; all his thoughts are: There is no God” </span>(Psalms 10:4). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti said: </span>Anyone who gets angry <span class="gemarra-regular">forgets his learning and increases foolishness, as it is stated: “For anger rests in the bosom of fools” </span>(Ecclesiastes 7:9), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written: “But a fool unfolds folly”</span> (Proverbs 13:16). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>With regard to one who gets angry, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is acknowledged that his sins are more numerous than his merits, as it is stated: “And a wrathful man abounds in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">transgression</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Proverbs 29:22). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Had Israel not sinned </span>in earlier times <span class="gemarra-regular">they would have been given the five books of the Torah and the book of Joshua alone. </span>They needed the book of Joshua <span class="gemarra-regular">because it </span>includes <span class="gemarra-regular">the arrangement of Eretz Yisrael. </span>Since it contains the division of Eretz Yisrael among the tribes, it was required for all generations, but the other books of the prophets primarily detail the history of how Israel angered God and He sent prophets to admonish them. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason, </span>i.e., what is the allusion to this idea? It is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For in much wisdom is much vexation” </span>(Ecclesiastes 1:18). All the wisdom that the Jews possess from the books of the Bible is the result of their angering God.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Asi said: One does not attend to </span>a request to dissolve a vow in which the name of <span class="gemarra-regular">the God of Israel </span>is invoked because such a declaration is especially stringent, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>a case where one swears by the God of Israel and adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Benefiting from me is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for my wif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because she stole my purse or she hit my son, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">it became known that she did not steal or did not hit </span>his son. In such a case, the vow can be dissolved because the vow was made in error, but in other cases such a vow is not dissolved. 
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>woman <span class="gemarra-regular">who came before Rav Asi. He said to her: With what </span>language <span class="gemarra-regular">did you vow? </span>She said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">By the God of Israel. He said to her: If you would have vowed </span>and said: <span class="gemarra-regular">By </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mohi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, which is merely a substitute name, I would have attended to your </span>request and dissolved the vow, but <span class="gemarra-regular">now that you did not vow by </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mohi</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but rather, by the God of Israel, I will not attend to your </span>request and dissolve the vow.
The Gemara relates another incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana happened </span>to come <span class="gemarra-regular">to the home of Rav Yosef. </span>Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Let the Master eat something. He said to him: No, </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master of all I will not eat it. </span>Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: No, </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master of all you will not eat it. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana’s </span>statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master of all </span>I will not eat it, is <span class="gemarra-regular">well </span>understood. <span class="gemarra-regular">But for Rav Yosef, why did he say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: No, </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master of all </span>you will not eat it? What was the purpose of his vow? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what he said to him: No, </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">the Master of all </span>you will not eat it <span class="gemarra-regular">is what you said; therefore, you may not eat it, </span>since a vow taken in such solemn fashion may not be dissolved. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that it is permitted for a halakhic authority to <span class="gemarra-regular">broach</span> dissolution based on <span class="gemarra-regular">regret, and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">attends to </span>a request to dissolve a vow in which the name of <span class="gemarra-regular">the God of Israel </span>is invoked.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava praised </span>his student <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Seḥora to Rav Naḥman </span>by saying <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is a great man. </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> When </span>Rav Seḥora <span class="gemarra-regular">comes to you, bring him to me. </span>Rav Seḥora <span class="gemarra-regular">had a vow </span>that he wanted <span class="gemarra-regular">to dissolve, </span>so Rava sent Rav Seḥora to Rav Naḥman. <span class="gemarra-regular">He came before Rav Naḥman. </span>
Rav Naḥman, who wanted to dissolve the vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Did you vow with such </span>a matter <span class="gemarra-regular">in mind? He said to him: Yes, </span>so Rav Naḥman did not dissolve the vow. He then asked again: Did you vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with such a matter in mind,</span> and suggested another possibility. He said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes.</span> This happened <span class="gemarra-regular">several times, </span>and every time Rav Naḥman attempted to broach an opening, Rav Seḥora replied that he had that in mind when he made the vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman became upset </span>with him because it appeared that Rav Seḥora was making it unnecessarily difficult for him to dissolve the vow. Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Go to your tent [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kilakh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> because I do not want to talk to you. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Seḥora went out and made </span>the following <span class="gemarra-regular">opening for himself </span>that would enable the dissolution of his vow, based on a mishna in tractate <span class="it-text">Avot</span> (2:1): <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: What is the proper path that a person should choose? </span>He should choose <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>path <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a glory to the one who does it and a glory from his fellow men. </span>Rav Seḥora then reasoned that <span class="gemarra-regular">now that Rav Naḥman became upset </span>at him, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would not have made the vow with knowledge of this </span>fact, since he would not receive glory from his fellow men, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>based on this <span class="gemarra-regular">he dissolved </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara relates a similar incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">had a vow to dissolve. He came before the Sages </span>for dissolution. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: Did you vow with the knowledge of this </span>particular fact? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said: Yes. </span>They proposed another possibility: Did you vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with the knowledge of this </span>other particular fact? He said to them: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes. </span>This happened <span class="gemarra-regular">several times, </span>

Daf 23a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and the Sages were troubled </span>by the fact that they could not dissolve the vow. They spent an extended period of time attempting to do so. During this time, they moved <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> a location with light from the <span class="gemarra-regular">sun to </span>one with <span class="gemarra-regular">shade, and </span>then moved again <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">shade </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara cites <span class="gemarra-regular">another version </span>of the incident: They asked him: Did you vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with knowledge of this </span>particular fact when you vowed? He said to them: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes. </span>This occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">several times and the Sages were troubled </span>with this problem for an extended period of time, during which they moved <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sun to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">shade and from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">shade to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sun, </span>but they did not find a solution. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Botnit, son of Abba Shau</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> ben Botnit, said to him:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Would you have vowed with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge that the Sages would be troubled </span>even to the point of going <span class="gemarra-regular">from shade to sun and from sun to shade? He said: No, and they dissolved it.</span>
The Gemara relates another incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael bar Rabbi Yosei had a vow to dissolve. He came before the Sages. They said to him: Did you vow with knowledge of this </span>particular fact? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: Yes. </span>They asked again: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did you vow with knowledge of this </span>other fact? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: Yes. </span>This occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">several times. When a certain launderer saw that the Sages were troubled </span>because Rabbi Yishmael caused them difficulty in successfully dissolving his vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">he hit </span>Rabbi Yishmael <span class="gemarra-regular">with a launderer’s too</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> that he had in his hand. Rabbi Yishmael <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Had I known that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">launderer would hit me </span>due to my vow <span class="gemarra-regular">I would not have vowed, and he dissolved it. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: This is </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">new situation, </span>which is not included among those matters that he could have considered at the time of the vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">because it would not enter </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">mind that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">launderer would hit him. And we </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned: We do not broach dissolution with </span>a person <span class="gemarra-regular">using a new situatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that did not exist at the time of the vow. Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This is not a new situation </span>that he could not have thought of previously, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it is common </span>to find <span class="gemarra-regular">heretics [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">appikurei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who </span>deny fundamental Torah principles and <span class="gemarra-regular">who trouble the Sages. </span>Although he would not have considered the possibility that this launderer would attack him, he may have considered the possibility that some heretic would. Therefore, it was permitted to broach dissolution in this manner.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">The wife of Abay</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> had a certain daughter. </span>Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>She should get married <span class="gemarra-regular">to my relative. </span>His wife <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that she should get married <span class="gemarra-regular">to her relative. He said to </span>his wife: <span class="gemarra-regular">Benefit from me should be forbidden to you, if you defy my will and marry her to your relative. She went and defied his will and married her to her relative</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">came before Rav Yosef. </span>Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If you had known that she would </span>ultimately <span class="gemarra-regular">defy your will and marry her to her relative, would you have made the vow? He said: No. And Rav Yosef dissolved </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for him </span>because Abaye did not think that his wife would actually defy him, and he intended the vow only to serve as a threat.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is it dissolved in a case like this, </span>where the vow was dependent on the daughter not marrying the wife’s relative? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, and it is taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> (5:1): There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident involving one man who vowed, </span>prohibiting <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife </span>from benefiting from him if she were <span class="gemarra-regular">to ascend to </span>Jerusalem for <span class="gemarra-regular">the pilgrimage Festival, and she defied his wil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and ascended to </span>Jerusalem for <span class="gemarra-regular">the pilgrimage Festival. And </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">he came before Rabbi Yosei </span>to request dissolution, Rabbi Yosei <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: And had you known that she would defy your will and ascend to </span>Jerusalem <span class="gemarra-regular">on the pilgrimage Festival, would you have vowed at all? He said to him: No, and Rabbi Yosei dissolved it. </span>This incident indicates that it is permitted to dissolve a vow with such an opening.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Even one who wants to take a vow </span>prohibiting <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>from benefiting from him, but only in order <span class="gemarra-regular">that he should eat with him, </span>not intending to take an actual vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">should say to him </span>at the outset: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any vow that I take in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">futur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is void. And </span>this statement is effective, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that he remembers at the time of the vow </span>that his intent at the beginning of the year was to render it void.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov’s proposal, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And since he said: Any vow that I take in the future should be void, </span>the one being invited <span class="gemarra-regular">will not listen to him and will not come </span>to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">with him, </span>since he already knows that the vow is not valid. That being the case, why would the first individual take a vow at all? 

Daf 23b

The Gemara answers: The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete and is teaching like this: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who wants another to eat with him, and he urges him </span>to do so <span class="gemarra-regular">and makes a vow with regard to him, this </span>vow <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>included in the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">vows of exhortation, </span>which do not require dissolution. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in addition, <span class="gemarra-regular">one who desires </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">his vows not be upheld </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire year should stand up on Rosh HaShan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and say: Any vow that I take in the futur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> should be void. And </span>this is statement is effective, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that he remembers at the time of the vow </span>that his intent at the beginning of the year was to render it void. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he remembers </span>at the time of the vow that his intent at the beginning of the year was to render it void but still makes the vow, then <span class="gemarra-regular">he has uprooted his stipulatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that all his vows are void <span class="gemarra-regular">and has upheld his vow. </span>Why, then, does it state that the vows are void in this case? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Teach: And </span>this is statement is effective, <span class="gemarra-regular">provided that he does not remember at the time of the vow </span>that his intention at the beginning of the year was to render it void. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Actually, </span>say <span class="gemarra-regular">as we sai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> initially, </span>that he does remember his stipulation at the time of the vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he stipulated </span>a condition <span class="gemarra-regular">on Rosh HaShana </span>rendering void vows that he would make later in the year, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he did not know with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">he made the stipulation, and now he makes a vow. If he remembers at the time of the vow and says: I am vowing in accordance with the initial intention</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> when I stipulated that all vows should be void, <span class="gemarra-regular">his vow has no substance. </span>However, if <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not say: I am vowing in accordance with the initial intention</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">he has uprooted his stipulation and upheld his vow. </span>
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana intended to teach </span>this topic <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span>the Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">lecture</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that everyone would learn this manner of rendering vows void on Rosh HaShana. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">conceals it </span>and does not say it explicitly, despite the fact that it is studied by Torah scholars, <span class="gemarra-regular">in order that </span>the public <span class="gemarra-regular">not treat vows lightly, and you teach it </span>publicly <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span>the Festival <span class="gemarra-regular">lecture?</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the scholars: Do <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis disagre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov </span>in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">or not? And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree </span>with him, is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in accordance with his </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">or not?</span> The Gemara suggests a proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear, as we learned </span>in a mishna (63b): <span class="gemarra-regular">One who says to another: </span>

Daf 24a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Benefiting from you is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for m</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if you do not take </span>from me <span class="gemarra-regular">for your son a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of wheat and two barrels of wine </span>as a gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>other individual <span class="gemarra-regular">can dissolve his vow without </span>the involvement of <span class="gemarra-regular">a halakhic authority. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">can say to </span>the one who vowed: Did <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>your vow for <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">other than due to my honor, </span>in order to convince me to accept a gift for my son? <span class="gemarra-regular">This is my honor, </span>that I refrain from accepting the gift. 
The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>that he may dissolve the vow without a halakhic authority is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the potential recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">said: This is my honor. But </span>if he did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>say <span class="gemarra-regular">so, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a vow. </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion does this follow? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>included in the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">vows of exhortation </span>and is not considered a vow, since the intention was solely to encourage the other individual to accept the gift. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, conclude from </span>this mishna that the <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis disagree with him </span>and hold that vows of exhortation are also vows.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, it is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, but Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov concedes in this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is a vow </span>and not just a means of encouragement <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>the one who took the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I am not a dog</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that I benefit from you and you do not benefit from me. </span>Therefore, one truly wants the vow to be valid so that the other will accept the gift, and it was not intended merely as a means of encouragement.
The Gemara suggests another proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the continuation of that mishna: So too, in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to another: Benefiting from me is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for you if you do not give my son a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of wheat and two barrels of wine, Rabbi Meir says: </span>The vow is valid, and he may not benefit from the one who took the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">until he gives </span>the gift. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: Even this </span>individual who took the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">can dissolve his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">vow without </span>the involvement of <span class="gemarra-regular">a halakhic authority, as he can say: I hereby </span>consider it <span class="gemarra-regular">as though I received </span>the gift from you.
The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The reason </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">because he said: I hereby </span>consider it <span class="gemarra-regular">as though I received it </span>from you. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if he did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>say <span class="gemarra-regular">so, it would be a vow. </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion does this statement reflect? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it reflects the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>included in the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">vows of exhortation. Rather, is it not </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, and </span>this demonstrates that the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree </span>with him with regard to vows of exhortation?
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, actually </span>it is possible that it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov. And Rabbi Eliezer </span>ben Ya’akov <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes in this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">that it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a vow because </span>the one that took the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">says to him: I am not a king that I </span>provide <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit to you and you do not </span>provide <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit to me. </span>Consequently, the intent is not simply to encourage him but rather, to actually take a vow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Kashisha, son of Rav Ḥisda, said to Rav Ashi: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a mishna (27a): What are examples of <span class="gemarra-regular">vows</span> impeded by <span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances beyond </span>one’s<span class="gemarra-regular"> control</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which do not require dissolution? If <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s friend took a vow with regard to him that he should eat with him, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he became sick, or his son became sick, or a river </span>that he was unable to cross <span class="gemarra-regular">barred him </span>from coming, these are vows impeded by circumstances beyond one’s control. The Gemara infers: Such a vow does not require dissolution in cases like these, but <span class="gemarra-regular">if not </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>unavoidable element, <span class="gemarra-regular">it would be a vow. </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion does this follow? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it follows the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">they are </span>vows of <span class="gemarra-regular">exhortation </span>that he did not intend to be treated as vows at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, and </span>it is therefore clear that the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree </span>with him? 
Rav Ashi responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>this follows the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov. But do you hold that </span>in the case here <span class="gemarra-regular">the host took a vow with regard to the </span>potential <span class="gemarra-regular">guest? No, </span>the case here is <span class="gemarra-regular">where the </span>potential <span class="gemarra-regular">guest caused a vow </span>to be taken <span class="gemarra-regular">by the hos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Do you invite me to your meal? </span>The inviter <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Yes. </span>The invitee then asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this vow upon you, </span>i.e., do you vow to do so? The inviter agreed <span class="gemarra-regular">and he vowed, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he became sick, or his son became sick, or a river barred him </span>from coming; <span class="gemarra-regular">these are vows </span>impeded by <span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances beyond </span>one’s<span class="gemarra-regular"> control. </span>Because the vow was initiated by the potential guest rather than the host, it cannot qualify as a vow of exhortation. Consequently, dissolution is not allowed except when unavoidable situations like these occur.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear</span> another proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Further </span>to the point of the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to his friend: Benefiting from you is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me if you do not lodge with me, and eat hot bread with me, and drink a cup </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">hot </span>water <span class="gemarra-regular">with me, and the other</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> becomes irritated at him </span>because he was forcing him to do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">these are also vows of exhortation. But the Rabbis did not concede to him </span>on this issue, because the friend’s opposition implies that the vow must be a valid vow and not a vow of exhortation. The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Rabbis did not concede to him? Does it not</span>

Daf 24b

mean <span class="gemarra-regular">that even in the earlier </span>cases, where he did not become irritated, they disagree with regard to vows of exhortation and hold that these vows are indeed valid, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>can one <span class="gemarra-regular">conclude from </span>here that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis disagree with him? </span>The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>here that this is so. 
With regard to the practical conclusion of this dispute, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>halakhic conclusion <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>reached <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>this matter? Does the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> follow the opinion of the Rabbis or that of Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rav Huna said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov. And so said Rav Adda bar Ahava: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Vows of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exaggeratio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that the Sages dissolved without a request to a halakhic authority, as described in the first mishna in the chapter, include the following examples. If <span class="gemarra-regular">one said </span>concerning a certain item: It is <span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me <span class="gemarra-regular">if I did not see on this road </span>as many people <span class="gemarra-regular">as those who ascended </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">Egypt, </span>or if he said: It is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me <span class="gemarra-regular">if I did not see a snake </span>as large <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">beam of an olive </span><span class="gemarra-regular">press</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in these cases the speaker did not intend to vow but used hyperbole to demonstrate a point, and it is understood by others that the expression is not to be taken literally.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A Sage taught: </span>Items rendered forbidden through <span class="gemarra-regular">vows of exaggeration [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">havai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted; </span>items rendered forbidden through <span class="gemarra-regular">oaths of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exaggeratio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Since oaths are very severe, one does not take an oath unless he intends it seriously. Therefore, it is not viewed as an oath of exaggeration.
The Gemara clarifies the details: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">oaths of exaggeration? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that </span>it is when one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>I take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath if I did not see on this road </span>as many people as those who ascended from Egypt, <span class="gemarra-regular">is he saying anything? </span>This statement is not formulated in the form of an oath and therefore has no validity at all, even if he was serious.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said that </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one says: </span>I take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I saw </span>on this road as many people as those who ascended from Egypt, the oath is valid. If he did not see that many people, he has taken a false oath. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If so, why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>this; it is not a novelty? <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that the case of an oath is <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a vow: </span>Just as in the case of a vow he speaks of not seeing, so too with regard to an oath he must be speaking of not seeing. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava said: </span>An oath of exaggeration is <span class="gemarra-regular">where he says: </span>All the <span class="gemarra-regular">produce of the world shall be forbidden to me by an oath if I did not see on this road </span>as many people <span class="gemarra-regular">as those </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">ascended </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">Egypt.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ashi: And perhaps this man saw an anthill and called them: </span>Those <span class="gemarra-regular">who ascended </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">Egypt, </span>because the quantity of ants was so numerous, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he took an oath properly. </span>Why, then, do we say that this is an oath taken in vain? 

Daf 25a

Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: When he takes an oath, he takes an oath based on our understanding, </span>which is that of an ordinary person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and we do not entertain </span>the possibility <span class="gemarra-regular">in our mind </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">referring to ants [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shumshemanei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, if he took an oath in that manner, it is assumed that he referred to people, like those that left Egypt. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And does a person not take an oath according to his own understanding? </span>There are times when one takes an oath with a particular stipulation in mind or intends a special meaning to his words. <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the judges <span class="gemarra-regular">administer an oath </span>to one who claims he paid a debt, <span class="gemarra-regular">they say to him: Know that we do not administer an oath to you based on a stipulation in your heart, </span>i.e., you cannot claim that you are taking the oath based on a condition you have in mind. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>your oath is taken <span class="gemarra-regular">based on our understandin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and on the understanding of the court. </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What does </span>the phrase that they say to him: Based on our understanding, come <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude? Does it not </span>serve <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one gave </span>the debtor <span class="gemarra-regular">tokens [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">iskundarei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> from a game, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in his mind <span class="gemarra-regular">he gives them </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">title </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">coins </span>and takes an oath that he returned these coins, which is the truth based on his unspoken thoughts.
The Gemara clarifies its question: <span class="gemarra-regular">And since </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that the oath taken in court is: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to our understanding, by inference </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">that a person commonly takes an oath according to his own understanding </span>and the oath would take effect according to his intent. Therefore, such a practice must be specifically excluded when taking an oath in a court. 
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this warning comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>a case similar to <span class="gemarra-regular">that cane of Rava, </span>in which a person attempts to deceive the court but does not necessarily utilize his own terminology, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who claimed money </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from another. He came before Rava </span>to adjudicate the case. The creditor <span class="gemarra-regular">said to the borrower: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Go repay me </span>your debt. The borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: I </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">repaid you. Rava said to him: If so, go take an oath to him that you repaid him. </span>
The borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">went and brought </span>a hollow <span class="gemarra-regular">cane, and placed </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">money inside it, and was leaning upon it, and went </span>leaning <span class="gemarra-regular">upon it to the court. He said to the lender: Hold this cane in your hand </span>so that I can take an oath while holding a Torah scroll. The borrower <span class="gemarra-regular">took the Torah scroll and swore that he had repaid </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire </span>sum <span class="gemarra-regular">that had been in his possession. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">That creditor </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">became angry </span>upon hearing the borrower taking a false oath <span class="gemarra-regular">and broke that cane, and </span>all of <span class="gemarra-regular">those coins </span>placed inside <span class="gemarra-regular">fell to the ground. And it turned out that he had taken the oath in truth, </span>since he had returned all the money at the time of the oath by giving him the cane with the money inside. However, this was a deceitful tactic, as he intended that the creditor return the cane and the money in it to him after he had taken the oath. In order to prevent this kind of deception, the one taking the oath is warned that he must take the oath according to the understanding of the court. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And still, does </span>a person <span class="gemarra-regular">not commonly take an oath according to his own understanding? But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And so we found with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Moses our teacher. When he administered an oath to the Jewish people in the plains of Moab, </span>that they accept the Torah upon themselves, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to them: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Know that I do not administer an oath upon you according to your understanding </span>and the stipulations in your hearts <span class="gemarra-regular">but according to my understanding and the understanding of the Omnipresent, as it is stated: “Neither with you only </span>do I make this covenant” (Deuteronomy 29:13). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">What did Moses say to Israel? Isn’t this what he said to them:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Perhaps you will perform </span>negative <span class="gemarra-regular">actions, </span>i.e., transgressions, <span class="gemarra-regular">and say: </span>The oath was taken <span class="gemarra-regular">according to our understanding. Due to that </span>reason, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to them: </span>You take the oath <span class="gemarra-regular">according to my understanding. </span>The Gemara clarifies: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>did his warning come <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude? Does it not</span> serve <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>the possibility <span class="gemarra-regular">that they give the title God, to </span>an object of <span class="gemarra-regular">idol worship </span>and say that this was their intention when they took an oath to worship God? The fact that Moses needed to preclude this claim indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person commonly takes an oath according to his own understanding.</span>
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, idol worship is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">called: God, </span>in the Bible, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “And against all the gods of Egypt </span>I will execute judgments” (Exodus 12:12). Therefore, this would not have been a special stipulation in their minds but a misguided intention within the oath itself. Moses suspected this and therefore issued the warning.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>why did Moses have to state the oath with this warning? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him administer an oath to them </span>with the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">That you will fulfill the mitzvot, </span>which also includes the prohibition against idol worship. The Gemara answers: The word mitzvot, meaning commandments, could also <span class="gemarra-regular">indicate </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">commandments of the king, </span>and this might be their intention if they were to take an oath in this manner. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let him administer an oath to them </span>with the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">That you will fulfill all </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot. </span>The Gemara answers: This too does not suffice, because this phrase could <span class="gemarra-regular">indicate </span>specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">the mitzva of ritual fringes, as the Master said: The mitzva of ritual fringes is equivalen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to all the mitzvot in the Torah. </span>Consequently, if they would accept upon themselves: All the mitzvot, they may have intended to refer only to the mitzva of ritual fringes. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let him administer an oath to them: That you fulfill the Torah. </span>The Gemara answers: That phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">indicates </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one Torah, </span>the Written Torah and not the Oral Torah. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let him administer an oath: That you fulfill the Torahs, </span>in the plural, to include both the Written Torah and Oral Torah. The Gemara answers: This too does not necessarily include the entire Torah, since it is possible that it <span class="gemarra-regular">indicates </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah of the meal-offering, the Torah of the sin-offering, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah of the guilt-offering. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let him administer an oath: That you fulfill the Torahs and mitzvot. </span>The Gemara answers: This also does not include the entire Torah, because the word <span class="gemarra-regular">Torahs </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">indicate the Torah of the meal-offering, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">indicate </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the commandments of the king.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let him administer an oath: That you fulfill the entire Torah. </span>The Gemara answers: Fulfilling <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire Torah </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">indicate </span>specifically the denial of <span class="gemarra-regular">idol worship, </span>which is also deemed fulfilling the entire Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Idol worship is so sever</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> a sin <span class="gemarra-regular">that anyone who denies it is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as though he concedes to </span>the truth of <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire Torah. </span>The opposite is true for someone who worships idols. Therefore, the Jewish people could have claimed that fulfilling the entire Torah denotes nothing more than not practicing idol worship. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let him administer an oath: That you fulfill </span>the mitzva to distance oneself from <span class="gemarra-regular">idol worship and </span>also fulfill <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire Torah. Or, alternatively, </span>let Moses administer an oath that the Jewish people will fulfill <span class="gemarra-regular">six hundred thirteen mitzvot, </span>so there will be no doubt as to their intention. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Moses our teacher used an expression that was not troublesome </span>for the Jews. Although he could have found another manner in which they could take an oath, and it would leave no doubt as to the correct intentions, he did not want to trouble them by employing a more complex method. Therefore, he administered the oath and stated that it was according to his understanding and the understanding of the Omnipresent.
§ It was taught in the mishna that if one prohibits an item with a <span class="it-text">konam</span> vow: <span class="gemarra-regular">If I did not see a snake </span>as large <span class="gemarra-regular">as the beam of an olive press</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is a vow of exaggeration. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>is there <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>a snake like this? <span class="gemarra-regular">But a certain snake that lived in the days of King Shapu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> was so big that <span class="gemarra-regular">they threw thirteen bundles of straw and it swallowed them, </span>so it was certainly bigger than the beam of an olive press. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said:</span> It is speaking here of a snake <span class="gemarra-regular">that is notched</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the one who took the vow intended to say that the snake had notches in its back like the beam of an olive press. The Gemara asks: But <span class="gemarra-regular">all snakes have notches </span>like this. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">We are saying that it is notched on its back, </span>which is exceedingly rare.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>explicitly that the snake was <span class="gemarra-regular">notched; </span>why did he say: Like the beam of an olive press? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He teaches us a matter in passing, </span>which is <span class="gemarra-regular">that the back of the beam of an olive press </span>must be <span class="gemarra-regular">notched. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the difference </span>whether there are notches in the beam of an olive press? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">For </span>purposes of <span class="gemarra-regular">buying and selling, to tell you </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one who sells the beam of an olive press to another, if its back is notched </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">yes, </span>the sale is valid, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if</span> its back is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>notched and there are no slits, then it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>a valid sale, as a beam without notches is not called a beam of an olive press. 

Daf 25b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> What are examples of <span class="gemarra-regular">vows that are unintentiona</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> that are dissolved, as taught at the beginning of the chapter? One who vows: This loaf is forbidden to me as if it were an offering [<span class="it-text">konam</span>] <span class="gemarra-regular">if I ate or if I drank, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he remembers that he ate or drank</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Or, one who vows: This loaf is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me if <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">ea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">drink, and he </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">forgets and eats or drinks. </span>Also, <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Benefiting from me is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for my wife because she stole my purse or she hit my son, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">it became known that she had not hit him or it became known that she had not stolen. </span>
The mishna lists another example of an unintentional vow: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">saw </span>people entering his courtyard and <span class="gemarra-regular">eating figs, and </span>because he did not want them to do so <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: </span>The figs are forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to you </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering. And </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">it was found </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">his father and brother </span>were in the group, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there were others with them </span>as well, and certainly he did not intend to take a vow prohibiting his father and brother from eating the figs. In such a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai says: They, </span>his father and brother, <span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted </span>to eat the figs, <span class="gemarra-regular">and those </span>others <span class="gemarra-regular">that were with them are prohibited </span>from doing so. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel says: </span>Both <span class="gemarra-regular">these and those are permitted </span>to eat the figs, as will be clarified in the Gemara.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages taught: Just as vows that are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> unintentional are dissolved, so too, oaths that are unintentional are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dissolved</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">unintentional oaths? </span><span class="gemarra-regular">For example, </span>as in the incident of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana and Rav Asi, </span>who disagreed about a <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. During the dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>I take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that Rav said </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>opinion that I hold. <span class="gemarra-regular">And that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>I take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that Rav said </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>opinion that I hold. This is an unintentional oath, <span class="gemarra-regular">as each one took an oath properly in his own mind </span>and was sure that he was saying the truth.
With regard to the mishna’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">saw them eating, </span>the Gemara states that <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>(66a): If one vows to fast or not to eat a certain food, dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">is broached based on </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbato</span><span class="gemarra-italic">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and based on Festivals, </span>since one certainly did not intend to include these days when taking the vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">Initially, they used to say: </span>On <span class="gemarra-regular">those days, </span><span class="it-text">Shabbatot</span> and Festivals, which he did not include in his vow, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to partake of the item, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">all other days </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from doing so. This was the case <span class="gemarra-regular">until Rabbi Akiva came and taught: A vow that was partially dissolve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is dissolved completely. </span>Therefore, one is permitted to partake on other days well. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: Everyone </span>in the mishna, i.e., Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, holds that <span class="gemarra-regular">wherever </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Had I known that </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">among you I would have said: All of you are prohibited </span>from eating figs <span class="gemarra-regular">except for father</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> then </span>in that case <span class="gemarra-regular">all are prohibited </span>from doing so <span class="gemarra-regular">and his father </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to do so. <span class="gemarra-regular">They disagreed only </span>in an instance <span class="gemarra-regular">where one said: Had I known that </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">among you then I would have said: So-and-so and so-and-so, </span>i.e., all the others, <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited </span>from eating figs <span class="gemarra-regular">and father is permitted </span>to do so. 

Daf 26a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava said: Everyone </span>holds <span class="gemarra-regular">that anywhere that one says: Had I known that father was among you I would have said: So-and-so and so-and-so are prohibited </span>to partake <span class="gemarra-regular">and father is permitted </span>to do so, then <span class="gemarra-regular">all are permitted </span>to partake. <span class="gemarra-regular">They disagree only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one says: Had I known that father was among you I would have said: All of you are prohibited </span>from partaking <span class="gemarra-regular">except for father.</span>
The rationale of the dispute is the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who said: </span>If one initially makes one declaration and immediately afterward makes a conflicting declaration, <span class="gemarra-regular">hold </span>him accountable for the <span class="gemarra-regular">first expression. </span>Since he initially said: All of you are prohibited from partaking, this expression is the effective one and they are all prohibited from doing so. The addition of the words: Except for father, is viewed as a clarification of the previous expression, simply indicating that his father is not included in the prohibition. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>by contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel hold in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, who said: A person is held accountable </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">for the conclusion of his statement, </span>and the second formulation is the primary one. Therefore, the fact that one altered his formulation to exclude his father from the prohibition means that the vow is partially canceled, and a vow that is partially dissolved is dissolved completely. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa raised an objection to Rava </span>from the following mishna (66a): <span class="gemarra-regular">In what case did Rabbi Akiva say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a vow which was partially dissolved is dissolved completely? </span>For example, if one said: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">of all of you is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not benefit </span>from it, if benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">one of them was permitted </span>for whatever reason, benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">all of them is permitted. </span>However, if one said: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">of this one and of that one </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">benefit </span>from it, then if benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">was permitted </span>for whatever reason, benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted, </span>but if benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">the last </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">was permitted, </span>benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">the last </span>one alone <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted and </span>benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the others <span class="gemarra-regular">is forbidden. </span>
Rav Pappa explains his objection: Rabba stated that when one qualifies his words by saying: I would have said all of you are prohibited from partaking except father, then all agree that everyone except his father is prohibited from doing so, but that when he adds to his words by saying: I would have said that so-and-so and so-and-so are prohibited from partaking and father is permitted to do so, there is a dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, he establishes </span>Rabbi Akiva’s <span class="gemarra-regular">first clause, </span>where benefit from all is permitted, as a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he</span> retracts and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>I meant to say that the property <span class="gemarra-regular">of this one and of that one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but not that of so-and-so, is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, which accords with the opinion of Beit Hillel. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the last clause </span>of the mishna, in which benefit from the last one alone is permitted, but benefit from all the others remains forbidden, is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he </span>retracts and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The property <span class="gemarra-regular">of all of you </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me except for that of one of you. According to the opinion of Rabba, both Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel would agree that in this case the one who stated the vow is permitted to benefit only from the one excluded from the vow. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to you, </span>Rava, who holds that if he said: I would have said that so-and-so and so-and-so are prohibited to partake and father is permitted to do so, all concede that everyone is permitted to partake, and that the dispute pertains to when one says: I would have said that all of you are prohibited to partake except for father, <span class="gemarra-regular">granted, he establishes the first claus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of Rabbi Akiva’s statement as a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>retracts and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>The property <span class="gemarra-regular">of all of you </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me except for that of father, and benefit from all is permitted, in accordance with the opinion of Beit Hillel. 

Daf 26b

<span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of that mishna, in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said: </span>I intended to prohibit eating figs <span class="gemarra-regular">to this one and to that one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and they are all permitted to do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>which is evident from the fact that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is cited in his name, then according to your opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">why do the Rabbis disagree with him? But haven’t you said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">all agree </span>that they are all <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to partake when the one who took the vow explains that he meant: To this one and to that one?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to</span> Rav Pappa: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to Rabba, </span>whose opinion you are supporting with this objection, <span class="gemarra-regular">does the latter clause work out well according to Rabbi Akiva? In what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">does he establish it? </span>In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one </span>retracted and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: From all of you, which of them is the first one and which of them is the last one? </span>The mishna stated that if benefit from the last one was permitted, benefit from the last one alone is permitted and benefit from all the others is forbidden. If he is now saying: From all of you, who is the first and who is the last?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Rava explains as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">The first clause </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said: From all of you, </span>and this follows the opinion of Beit Hillel, who say, according to Rava, that the entire vow is dissolved. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause, </span>i.e., the last two cases, it is referring to where he did not specify: From this one and from that one, but where, <span class="gemarra-regular">for example, he linked them to one anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and said: So-and-so </span>should be prohibited to partake <span class="gemarra-regular">like so-and-so, and so-and-so like so-and-so, </span>but there is no general prohibition on all of them. Rather, each prohibition is linked to another one. Therefore, if the prohibition pertaining to the first individual is dissolved, then all those prohibitions linked to that one are dissolved as well.
The Gemara comments: The language <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> concerning this mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">the middle one </span>in this chain of people prohibited by the vow from partaking <span class="gemarra-regular">was permitted </span>to do so, then <span class="gemarra-regular">from him and below, </span>i.e., those who were mentioned after him, <span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted </span>to partake, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>from him and <span class="gemarra-regular">above, </span>i.e., those who were mentioned before him, <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited </span>from partaking. This indicates that the mishna speaks about a case where the prohibitions are linked together. Therefore, the prohibition is dissolved for those who were mentioned after that individual whose prohibition is dissolved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava raised an objection to Rava</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> The mishna (66a) states that if one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Onions are </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will not <span class="gemarra-regular">taste them, because onions are bad for the heart</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and others <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: But isn’t the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kufer</span><span class="gemarra-italic">i</span> onion <span class="gemarra-regular">good for the heart, </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">is dissolved with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kuferi</span> onions, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not only with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kuferi</span> onions is it dissolved, <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to all </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">onions. </span>The mishna relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident </span>of this kind <span class="gemarra-regular">occurred, and Rabbi Meir dissolved </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to all </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">onions. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>speaking here of a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>that person <span class="gemarra-regular">said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Had I known that the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kuferi</span> onion <span class="gemarra-regular">is good for the heart I would have said: All onions are forbidden and </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">kuferi</span> onion <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted? </span>This would be difficult for Rabba, who argues in similar cases that all opinions maintain that the other onions are forbidden, as well as for Rava, who would hold that only Beit Shammai, who follow the opinion of Rabbi Meir, maintain that all onions are forbidden in this type of case, and yet here Rabbi Meir himself permits all types of onions.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>this should be explained as a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one says: If I had known that the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kuferi</span> onion <span class="gemarra-regular">is good for the heart, I would have said: Such an onion and such </span>an onion <span class="gemarra-regular">are forbidden </span>to me <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">kuferi</span> onion <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Akiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and</span> also <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Rabbis. </span>This is because, according to Rava, when one says: This one and that one, all agree that everything is permitted.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina raised an objection to Rava: Rabbi Natan says there is a vow that is partially dissolved and partially binding. How </span>so? One who <span class="gemarra-regular">took a vow </span>that benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>all the items in <span class="gemarra-regular">a baske</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> be forbidden to him, 

Daf 27a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and there were </span><span class="gemarra-italic">benot</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">shua</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥ</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in it, and he said: Had I known that there were </span><span class="gemarra-italic">benot</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">shuaḥ</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in it I would not have taken a vow, the basket </span>and the remaining figs inside <span class="gemarra-regular">are forbidden, </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">benot</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">shuaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are permitted. </span>This was the accepted ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">until Rabbi Akiva came and taught: A vow which is dissolved partially is dissolved completely. </span>Therefore, all of the produce is permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>referring to a case where one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Had I known that </span><span class="gemarra-italic">benot</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">shuaḥ</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">were inside it, I would have said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">black and white figs are forbidden, </span>and <span class="gemarra-italic">benot</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">shuaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are permitted, and this is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, and the Rabbis disagree </span>with him? But according to Rava everyone agrees that all the produce is permitted in a case like this.
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is possible to say that it is speaking of a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he says: Had I known that there were </span><span class="gemarra-italic">benot</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">shuaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in it I would have said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire basket is forbidden and </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">benot</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">shuaḥ</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are permitted, </span>which is the opinion of Rabbi Akiva according to Rava.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught that which the Sages taught: </span>With regard to one who <span class="gemarra-regular">took a vow, in one </span>utterance, prohibiting himself from deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from five people, </span>if the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">is dissolved for one of them, </span>then the vow concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">all of them </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is dissolved; </span>but if he retracted and said: I am prohibited to derive benefit from all of these individuals <span class="gemarra-regular">except for one of them, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">he, </span>i.e., that individual who was excluded, <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted and they, </span>the others, <span class="gemarra-regular">are forbidden? </span>
The Gemara explains two possibilities: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one says that it is in accordance <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the explanation of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">first clause </span>is referring to a case where after having taken a vow prohibiting himself from deriving benefit from all five people, he retracted and said: Benefit from this one and from that one are forbidden but benefit from one is permitted, and it is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>that a vow which is dissolved partially is dissolved completely. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the latter clause </span>is where he adds to the initial vow by stating: Except for one of them, and <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees</span> that only that one is permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>one says that it is in accordance <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the explanation of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> latter clause </span>is in accordance with the opinion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbis, and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> everyone agrees </span>with the ruling of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause. </span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> What are examples of <span class="gemarra-regular">vows </span>impeded by <span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances beyond </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">control? </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s friend took a vow with regard to him that he should eat with him, and he became sick, or his son became </span><span class="gemarra-regular">sick</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or a river </span>that he was unable to cross <span class="gemarra-regular">barred him </span>from coming, <span class="gemarra-regular">these are </span>examples of <span class="gemarra-regular">vows </span>whose fulfillment are impeded by <span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances beyond </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">control</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> They are not binding and do not require dissolution.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara relates that there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who </span>had a dispute in court with another individual and wanted to postpone the trial to a later time in order to search for more evidence. Meanwhile, he <span class="gemarra-regular">deposited </span>his documents for <span class="gemarra-regular">a favorable</span> verdict, i.e., that supported his claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">in court, and </span>since the other litigant did not believe that he would return, the man <span class="gemarra-regular">said: If I do not come </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">within thirty days, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>documents for <span class="gemarra-regular">a favorable verdict will be void. He was impeded </span>by circumstances beyond his control <span class="gemarra-regular">and did not come </span>back. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: His </span>documents for <span class="gemarra-regular">a favorable verdict are void </span>since he did not return by the specified time. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him: He is a victim of circumstances beyond </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">control and </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One exempted a victim of circumstances beyond </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">control </span>from responsibility for his actions, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written </span>concerning a young woman who was raped: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But unto the damsel you shall do nothing; </span>there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death” (Deuteronomy 22:26). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that with regard to the penalty of <span class="gemarra-regular">death, </span>which is extremely severe, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">different, </span>and she is treated leniently and not executed, but with regard to other transgressions one’s actions are treated as deliberate, <span class="gemarra-regular">but didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna here: What are examples of <span class="gemarra-regular">vows </span>whose fulfillment are impeded by <span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances beyond </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">control</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> If <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s friend took a vow with regard to him that he should eat with him, and he became sick, or his son became sick, or a river </span>that he was unable to cross <span class="gemarra-regular">barred him </span>from coming, <span class="gemarra-regular">these are </span>examples of <span class="gemarra-regular">vows </span>whose fulfillment are impeded by <span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances beyond </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">control; </span>they are not binding and do not require dissolution. This demonstrates that even here the exemption due to circumstances beyond one’s control should apply. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to Rava,</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">different from </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Gittin</span> 76b): If a man says to his wife: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is your bill of divorce from no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if I do not arrive from now until </span>the conclusion of <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve months, and he died within </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve months, this </span>document <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">bill of divorce </span>from the time of his declaration. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why? But he was a victim of circumstances beyond </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">control, </span>as death is the ultimate example of this? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">different there, </span>

Daf 27b

<span class="gemarra-regular">for had he known that he would die </span>within a year <span class="gemarra-regular">he would have immediately finalized </span>his decision <span class="gemarra-regular">and given </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">the bill of divorce. </span>Since he gave it to her initially so that she not require levirate marriage, it is assumed that his intent was to deliver it even in this case. By contrast, in the case where one stipulated about his rights, which he certainly did not intend to forfeit, it is assumed that he would not have wanted his statement to take effect in this situation.
The Gemara continues to question Rava: In <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">different from </span>the following case: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to</span> the agents with whom he entrusted a bill of divorce: <span class="gemarra-regular">If I do not return from now until thirty days </span>have passed, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">be a bill of divorce. He came </span>on the thirtieth day <span class="gemarra-regular">but was prevented </span>from crossing the river <span class="gemarra-regular">by the ferr</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> that was located on the other side of the river, so he did not arrive within the designated time. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to the </span>people across the river: <span class="gemarra-regular">See that I have arrived, see that I have arrived. And Shmuel said: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is not considered </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">an arrival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the condition is considered to have been fulfilled. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>is it not considered an arrival; <span class="gemarra-regular">but he was impeded by circumstances beyond </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">control? </span>
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumstances beyond </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">control that are apparent </span>to everyone and could have been anticipated ahead of time <span class="gemarra-regular">is different, and a ferry is</span> considered <span class="gemarra-regular">an apparent </span>type of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumstance beyond </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">control, </span>which he should have considered and stipulated explicitly. Since he did not do so, it is not considered a circumstance beyond one’s control.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to Rav Huna, </span>who said that his documents for a favorable verdict are rendered void if he does not return by the set time, it is difficult to understand why the stipulation is valid. <span class="gemarra-regular">After all, it is a transaction with inconclusive consent</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">asmakhta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since he certainly assumed that he would return and intended to actually give away his documents, <span class="gemarra-regular">and an</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">asmakhta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not effect acquisition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Even if a person performs an act of acquisition to that effect, he does not have the intention to actually follow through. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">different because his </span>documents for <span class="gemarra-regular">a favorable verdict are being held </span>by the court, so he certainly did intend to give them up in the event that he not return on time.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>his rights <span class="gemarra-regular">are held </span>by another party, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">asmakhta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Batra</span> 168a): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who repaid part of his debt, and deposited his </span>loan <span class="gemarra-regular">document with a third </span>party for purposes of security, <span class="gemarra-regular">and said: If I do not give him </span>the remainder of the debt <span class="gemarra-regular">from now until thirty days, give him his </span>loan <span class="gemarra-regular">document </span>and he can collect the entire amount. 
If <span class="gemarra-regular">the time arrived and he did not give </span>the remainder of the debt to the creditor, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span>The third party <span class="gemarra-regular">should give </span>the document to the debtor. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda says: He should not give </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Naḥman said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Avuh said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who said that an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">asmakhta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> effects acquisition. </span>The reason for this is that the one who deposited the document believes he will return in time and never intended to give over the document. It can be seen in the mishna that even in a case where the document was held by a third party, it is still considered an <span class="it-text">asmakhta</span> and is not valid. 
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is different here because </span>the one who deposited his documents with the court explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">said that </span>documents for <span class="gemarra-regular">a favorable verdict should be void</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which demonstrates that he intended to uphold his stipulation. 
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> in these cases is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">An </span><span class="gemarra-italic">asmakhta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> effects acquisitio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> even if it is dependent on a condition that may not be fulfilled, <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this is </span>true only <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the one who had stated the obligation dependent upon the <span class="it-text">asmakhta</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was not impeded </span>by circumstances beyond his control that prevented him from doing so, and instead deliberately chose not to fulfill the stipulation. In addition, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">if he effected an acquisition from </span>the other party for this <span class="it-text">asmakhta</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in an eminent court, </span>but not for an agreement that takes place not in an eminent court.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One may take a vow to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">murderers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., people suspected of killing others over monetary matters; <span class="gemarra-regular">or to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">robbers </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaramin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or to tax </span><span class="gemarra-regular">collector</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> who wish to collect tax, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the produce in his possession <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">terum</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">although it is not </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>One may also take a vow to them <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the produce in his possession <span class="gemarra-regular">belongs to the house of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">king</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">although it does not belong to the house of the king. </span>One may take a false vow to save himself or his possessions, as a statement of this sort does not have the status of a vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: One may vow </span>in such a case, although he has no intention that his words be true, <span class="gemarra-regular">using every</span> means of taking a vow or making a prohibition in order to mislead those people, 

Daf 28a

<span class="gemarra-regular">except for by </span>taking of <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath, </span>due to its more stringent nature. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: </span>One may mislead them <span class="gemarra-regular">even by </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: </span>When negotiating with a robber, <span class="gemarra-regular">one should not initiate by </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">a vow </span><span class="gemarra-regular">for him </span>unless the robber does not believe his claim, in which case he may take a vow to reinforce his words. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: He may even initiate </span>by taking a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">to him. Beit Shammai say: </span>One may take a vow only <span class="gemarra-regular">about that which </span>the robber <span class="gemarra-regular">compels him to take a vow </span>but may not add to it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: </span>One may take a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">even about that which he does not compel him to take a vow. </span>
The mishna explains the previous statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>so? If the extortionist <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that he should <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Benefiting from me is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for my wife </span>if the vow is not true, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he said: Benefiting from me is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for my wife and my children, Beit Shammai say: His wife is permitted </span>to benefit from him, since the extortionist demanded that he take that vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">but his children, </span>whom he added of his own accord, <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited </span>from benefiting from their father. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: Both these and those are permitted </span>to benefit from him.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks, concerning the mishna’s statement that one may take a vow to tax collectors: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t Shmuel say: The law of the kingdom is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., there is a halakhic principle that Jews must obey the laws of the state in which they live? Since one must pay the tax determined by the kingdom, how did the Sages permit one to lie in order to avoid paying?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥinnana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>The mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a tax collector who has no </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fixed amoun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> for collection established by the kingdom, but rather collects the tax arbitrarily. Therefore, this case is not included in the law of the kingdom. A Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">of the school of Rabbi Yannai said: </span>The mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a tax collector who establishes himself </span>as such <span class="gemarra-regular">independently </span>and was not appointed by the kingdom. 
§ The mishna states: He may also take a vow to them <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>his produce <span class="gemarra-regular">belongs to the house of the king, although it does not belong to the house of the king. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>does he <span class="gemarra-regular">take a vow</span> in this way? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Amram said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>This is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said: The produce of the world should be forbidde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to me if </span>this produce <span class="gemarra-regular">does not belong to the house of the king. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since he said </span>that the produce of the world <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be forbidden </span>to him, shouldn’t <span class="gemarra-regular">all the produce of the world is forbidden to him, </span>as this produce did not belong to the house of the king? The Gemara answers: This is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he says: </span>They shall be forbidden to me only <span class="gemarra-regular">today</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara wonders: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he says: Today, the tax collector will not accept it </span>as a vow, since it is not difficult to avoid eating produce for one day. Therefore, he may still be suspected of lying. 
The Gemara answers: This is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he says: Today, in his heart but verbalizes </span>the vow in <span class="gemarra-regular">an unspecified </span>manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">And although we hold </span>that unspoken <span class="gemarra-regular">matters that </span>remain <span class="gemarra-regular">in the heart are not </span>significant <span class="gemarra-regular">matter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> and are not taken into consideration, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to circumstances beyond </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">control it is different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and he is permitted to rely on the mental stipulation that he added in order to limit the duration of the prohibition effected by the vow.
§ The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say </span>that they may take a vow in such a case <span class="gemarra-regular">using every </span>means of vowing except for an oath, while Beit Hillel say they may take a vow even using an oath. <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: </span>One may vow only <span class="gemarra-regular">about that which </span>the extortionist <span class="gemarra-regular">compels him to take a vow </span>but may not add to it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: </span>One may take a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">even about that which he does not compel him to take a vow. How </span>so? If the extortionist <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that he should <span class="gemarra-regular">say: Benefiting from me is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for my wife </span>if the vow is not true, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he said: Benefiting from me is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for my wife and my children, Beit Shammai say: His wife is permitted</span> to benefit from him, since the extortionist demanded that he take that vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">but his children, </span>whom he added of his own accord, <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited </span>from benefiting from their father. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say: Both these and those are permitted </span>to benefit from him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said </span>that a Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: Beit Shammai say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not initiate by </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath to him </span>unless the extortionist does not believe his claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Beit Hillel say: He may even initiate by </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath to him. </span>The Gemara asks: A precise analysis of the wording indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Beit Shammai it is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath to him that one may not initiate, but one may initiate by </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">a vow to him. </span>Rav Huna asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn</span> in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: He may not initiate by </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">a vow to him? </span>
Rav Huna asks another question: <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>a precise analysis of the wording indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not initiate by </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath to him, but he may certainly vow with an oath </span>if the tax collector insists on it; <span class="gemarra-regular">but didn’t we learn </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: They may take a vow </span>in such a case <span class="gemarra-regular">using every </span>means of vowing in order to mislead them <span class="gemarra-regular">except for by taking an oath, </span>which indicates that one may not take an oath even if he does not initiate with one? 
The Gemara resolves the contradiction: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna taught </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">pertains to a vow to convey to you the far-reaching nature of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai, </span>who say that one may not initiate even with a vow. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">pertains to an oath to convey to you the far-reaching nature of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel, </span>who maintain that initiating even with an oath is permitted. It is apparent that according to Beit Shammai one may not initiate with a vow and may not take an oath at all. Therefore, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cannot be used to infer Beit Shammai’s opinion concerning oaths. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said </span>the following to resolve the contradiction: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> does not refer to a vow taken in the case of robbers or tax collectors. Rather, the dispute focuses on an entirely different topic: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>allowance for <span class="gemarra-regular">a request </span>for dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">of an oath, </span>and the statement: He may not initiate, relates to a halakhic authority who seeks an opening to dissolve an oath. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Beit Hillel say there is </span>an allowance for <span class="gemarra-regular">a request </span>for dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">of an oath</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one sees his property in danger of being destroyed, and takes a vow stating, for example: <span class="gemarra-regular">These saplings are </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">offerin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">if they are not cut </span>down, or: <span class="gemarra-regular">This garment is </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering if it is not burned, </span>these items are consecrated if the saplings remain standing or if the garment is not burned. In addition, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are subject to </span>the possibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">redemption </span>just as other items consecrated for maintenance of the Temple may be redeemed. But if one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">These saplings are </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering until they are cut </span>down, or: <span class="gemarra-regular">This garment is </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering until it is burned, </span>

Daf 28b

then <span class="gemarra-regular">they are not subject to </span>the possibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">redemption.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara questions the language of the mishna: Why does the mishna utilize the wording: They have redemption and they do not have redemption? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: They are consecrated and they are not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since the primary novelty is that they are consecrated, but not completely. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since it wanted to teach </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">They are not subject to </span>the possibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">redemption, </span>which cannot be expressed as: They are not consecrated, as they are consecrated, <span class="gemarra-regular">it taught also the first clause </span>using the language: <span class="gemarra-regular">They are subject to </span>the possibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">redemption.</span>
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">How did he take a vow? </span>What was the precise language that he used? <span class="gemarra-regular">Ameimar said: Where he says: </span>These saplings are like an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">if they are not cut </span>down <span class="gemarra-regular">today, and the day passed and they were not cut </span>down. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>that they are consecrated? Isn’t it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that his vow takes effect? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, it is necessary </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is a great </span>strong <span class="gemarra-regular">wind </span>and he thought that they would be uprooted by the wind.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t this taught together with </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a garment, </span>indicating that the two are equivalent, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a garment ready for burning, </span>i.e., is it assumed that it will burn? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is a fire. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here also there is a great </span>strong <span class="gemarra-regular">wind, and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">enters your mind that one raised in his mind </span>the possibility <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the saplings <span class="gemarra-regular">will not be saved, and due to that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">he took a vow. </span>Since in any event he assumes he will lose the saplings, perhaps he did not really intend to consecrate them. The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that in spite of this it is still considered a vow.
§ The mishna states that if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">These saplings are </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering </span>until they are cut down, they are not subject to the possibility of redemption. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>are they not subject to redemption <span class="gemarra-regular">forever? Bar Padda said: </span>If he <span class="gemarra-regular">redeemed them, they become consecrated again, </span>as they have not yet been cut down. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">redeemed them </span>again, <span class="gemarra-regular">they become consecrated again, until they are cut </span>down. Once <span class="gemarra-regular">they are cut </span>down, <span class="gemarra-regular">he redeems them once and it is sufficient. And Ulla said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Once they are cut </span>down one does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>need to <span class="gemarra-regular">redeem them again </span>because they are no longer consecrated. 

Daf 29a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna said </span>to Ulla: <span class="gemarra-regular">Where did their sanctity go? </span>How can the consecrated saplings become non-sacred without being redeemed? <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>would happen <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">said to a woman </span>while performing betrothal: <span class="gemarra-regular">Today you are my wife and tomorrow you are not my wife? Would she exit </span>the marriage the next day <span class="gemarra-regular">without a bill of divorce? </span>Likewise, in the mishna, once one consecrated the saplings, how is their sanctity withdrawn without redemption?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him: </span>How <span class="gemarra-regular">do you compare</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sanctity </span>inherent in its <span class="gemarra-regular">value </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">inherent sanctity? Sanctity </span>inherent in its <span class="gemarra-regular">value departs with nothing </span>being done, since it is conditional. When the condition is fulfilled and the saplings are cut, the sanctity is removed. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">inherent sanctity, </span>which relates to an entity that itself is consecrated, e.g., a betrothed woman, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not depart with nothing </span>being done. An action must be performed in order to remove it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: </span>And does <span class="gemarra-regular">inherent sanctity not depart with nothing </span>being done? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that if one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This ox </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">a burnt-offerin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty days and after thirty days </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a peace-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty days </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a burnt-offering </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">after thirty days </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a peace-offering. </span>One can ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>is this so? <span class="gemarra-regular">These </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>examples of <span class="gemarra-regular">inherent sanctity, and it departs with nothing </span>being done. After thirty days, it is transformed into a peace-offering without any action being taken.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one did not consecrate the animal as a burnt-offering or peace-offering but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span>that he was consecrating it <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary value, </span>with which to purchase a burnt-offering or peace-offering. Therefore, there was no inherent sanctity.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, say the latter clause: </span>If he said that <span class="gemarra-regular">after thirty days </span>it should be <span class="gemarra-regular">a burnt-offering, and from now </span>until thirty days it should be <span class="gemarra-regular">a peace-offering, </span>his words are binding. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>clause is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to inherent sanctity and one </span>clause is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to sanctity </span>inherent in its <span class="gemarra-regular">value, </span>

Daf 29b

then <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">was necessary for the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to teach two </span>clauses: In order to emphasize that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies in both cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it might <span class="gemarra-regular">enter your mind to say: Inherent sanctity does not lapse on its own, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctity </span>inherent in its <span class="gemarra-regular">value departs with nothing </span>being done. <span class="gemarra-regular">Because of this, the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> taught two </span>clauses, to demonstrate that there is no difference between them: Both depart with nothing being done. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>clause <span class="gemarra-regular">and that</span> clause refer to <span class="gemarra-regular">sanctity </span>inherent in its <span class="gemarra-regular">value, why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">to teach two </span>clauses? <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, it can be said </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">from the stringent sanctity </span>of the burnt-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">to the less stringent sanctit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> of a peace-offering, the stringent sanctity <span class="gemarra-regular">departs </span>and the animal becomes like a peace-offering, then <span class="gemarra-regular">from the less stringent sanctity </span>of the peace-offering <span class="gemarra-regular">to the more stringent sanctity </span>of the burnt-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">need this be said? </span>
The Gemara proposes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>us <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">should be a conclusive refutation of bar Padda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who said: Sanctity does not depart with nothing </span>being done and the trees require redemption, while the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> demonstrates that even inherent sanctity lapses on its own?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Bar Padda </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: This is what </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: </span>If one says: This ox, after thirty days, is a burnt-offering, then <span class="gemarra-regular">if he does not say: From now </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a peace-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">after thirty days it is a burnt-offering. </span>But when he adds: From now it is a peace-offering, the sanctity of a peace-offering takes effect upon it and does not depart with nothing being done. 
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">just as it is </span>in the case of a man <span class="gemarra-regular">who says to a woman: Be betrothed to me after thirty day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> with this money that I give you, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>she <span class="gemarra-regular">is betrothed </span>after thirty days. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is so, <span class="gemarra-regular">although the money was squandered away </span>in the meantime and does not exist at the end of thirty days, when the betrothal takes effect. Here as well, the sanctity of a burnt-offering takes effect after thirty days.
The Gemara asks: If this is what happened, then it <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious </span>that it is so. Why, then, does this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> need to be taught? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he retracted </span>within these thirty days and did not want the animal to be consecrated at all. Although the sanctity did not actually take effect yet, he may not retract.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well according to the one who said </span>that a woman who is betrothed on the condition that the betrothal takes effect after thirty days <span class="gemarra-regular">may not retract </span>even if she changed her mind within these thirty days, and the betrothal still takes effect after thirty days. <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">she may retract, what can be said? </span>Why should the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of consecration be any different than for betrothal? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there, </span>in the case of betrothal, the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">retract </span>within thirty days, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the case of the burnt-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is different because </span>the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">one’s declaration to God is equal to </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">his transfer to a common person [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hedyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> where the acquisition is consummated at the time of transfer. Since God is not associated with a particular location, a verbal statement is sufficient to establish sanctity immediately. But in the case of the betrothal of a woman, it can be argued that the betrothal takes effect only at the end of thirty days.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Avin and Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi, sat befor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yirmeya, and Rabbi Yirmeya was dozing [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">menamnem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> While he was dozing, <span class="gemarra-regular">they sat and said: According to bar Padda, who said </span>that if he <span class="gemarra-regular">redeems them </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">become consecrated again, </span>

Daf 30a

<span class="gemarra-regular">resolve </span>the dilemma from here, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rav Hoshaya asked: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who gives two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">perutot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a woma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and says to her: With one </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">be betrothed to me today and with one be betrothed to me after I divorce you, </span>what is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Rav Hoshaya was uncertain whether the second betrothal is effective after the divorce. Bar Padda holds that if he redeems the consecrated saplings, they again become consecrated. Apparently, he holds that upon the redemption, the second consecration immediately goes into effect. From bar Padda’s opinion, one could say: <span class="gemarra-regular">So too, </span>here, after the first marriage is ended by the bill of divorce, the second betrothal that was previously performed takes effect, and <span class="gemarra-regular">it should be </span>a valid <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothal. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya, </span>who had been dozing, <span class="gemarra-regular">woke up </span>when he heard their conversation and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>For <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">are you comparing </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">he redeemed them to where others redeemed them? </span>The <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> are not similar. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he redeemed </span>the saplings, <span class="gemarra-regular">they become consecrated again</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but if <span class="gemarra-regular">others redeemed them </span>before they were cut <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not become consecrated again, </span>since they are not in his possession anymore, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman </span>given a bill of divorce from her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">is considered</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as if others redeemed her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This is because upon divorce she is completely independent, and the second marriage can therefore take effect only with her consent. But if she refuses, the betrothal is not valid. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">It was also stated </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They taught only </span>that bar Padda holds that the saplings become consecrated again <span class="gemarra-regular">when he redeemed them </span>himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">others redeemed them they do not become consecrated again </span>for he cannot consecrate them after they have been in the possession of others, and it no longer depends on his intent.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who takes a vow </span>that he will not derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">seafarers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those who live on dry land. </span>But if he takes a vow not to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those who live on dry land, </span>he is also <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from seafarers, because seafarers are included </span>within the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">those who live on dry land. </span>The mishna now defines seafarers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Not like those that travel </span>by ship <span class="gemarra-regular">from Akko to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Jaffa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is a short trip, <span class="gemarra-regular">but rather one who customarily departs [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lefaresh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> to distant locations, e.g., foreign countries.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s definition of seafarers, there is a dispute between <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa and Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika. One teaches </span>this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the first clause </span>of the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one teaches </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the latter clause. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">The one who teaches </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the first clause teaches </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">like this: One who takes a vow </span>not to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from seafarers </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those who live on dry land. But </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from seafarers, and </span>seafarers are <span class="gemarra-regular">not like </span><span class="gemarra-regular">those</span>

Daf 30b

<span class="gemarra-regular">who travel from Akko to Jaffa, for they are </span>treated like <span class="gemarra-regular">those who dwell on the land. Rather, </span>the term seafarers means he took a vow that deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those who customarily depart </span>out to sea is forbidden to him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the one who teaches it with regard to the latter clause </span>of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who takes a vow </span>not to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those who dwell on dry lan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited from </span>deriving benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">seafarers, and </span>this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">not only with regard to those who travel from Akko to Jaffa,</span> who are certainly not considered seafarers, <span class="gemarra-regular">but even with regard to one who customarily departs </span>to great distances. Why is such a person also considered a dweller on dry land? <span class="gemarra-regular">Since eventually he will go up onto dry land. </span>No one lives his entire life at sea. Eventually, one will reach dry land, so all people are called dwellers on dry land.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who takes a vow </span>not to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those who see the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">su</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">even from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">blind, </span>although they see nothing. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because he meant only </span>to include all <span class="gemarra-regular">those that the sun sees, </span>i.e., shines upon with light.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara explains why the mishna states that blind people are included: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Since he did not say: From those who see, </span>which would exclude blind people. Instead, he employed the phrase: Those who see the sun, which comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">exclude fish and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fetuses</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who do not see the sun. Consequently, the vow is interpreted to refer to those who are exposed to the sun, including the blind.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who takes a vow </span>not to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>those that have <span class="gemarra-regular">dark heads [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sheḥorei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">harosh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those that are bald, </span>although they have no hair at all, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>from the <span class="gemarra-regular">elderly </span>who have white hair. This is because the term is not to be understood in its simple meaning but rather in a broader manner. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from women and from children, because only men are called: </span>Those with <span class="gemarra-regular">dark heads.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that the term dark heads does not exclude those that are bald? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because it does not say: From those with hair.</span>
The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from women and from children, because only men are called: </span>Those with <span class="gemarra-regular">dark heads. </span>The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Men sometimes cover their heads and sometimes uncover their heads</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> They can be called dark heads since, for the most part, they have dark hair which is often uncovered. <span class="gemarra-regular">But women’s </span>heads <span class="gemarra-regular">are always covered</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and children’s </span>heads <span class="gemarra-regular">are always uncovered, </span>and the expression dark heads is referring to men whose hair is sometimes seen. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who takes a vow </span>not to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those that are born </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yeludim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to derive benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">those who will be born [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">noladim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>after the time of the vow. But if one takes a vow not to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those who will be born, </span>he is also <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those that are </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">born </span>at the time of the vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir permits </span>deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">even from those that are </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">born </span>at the time of the vow because he holds that the one taking the vow was precise in prohibiting only those that will be born. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: He intended </span>to include with this expression <span class="gemarra-regular">only one whose nature is to be born. </span>Therefore, both those who will be born and those who were already born are included in the vow. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Rabbi Meir, </span>in the case of one who takes a vow that deriving benefit from those who will be born is forbidden to him, the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that he is permitted to derive benefit even from those who are already born at the time of the vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the mishna’s use of the term: Even, indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not necessary </span>to say that those who <span class="gemarra-regular">will be born </span>are permitted to him. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>if that is the case, <span class="gemarra-regular">from whom is he prohibited </span>to derive benefit? The vow appears to have no effect. 
The Gemara answers: The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete and is teaching like this: One who takes a vow </span>not to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those that are born </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to derive benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">those who will be born </span>after the time of the vow. But if one takes a vow not to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those who will be born, </span>he is also <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those that are </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">born </span>at the time of the vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: Even one who takes a vow </span>not to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those who will be born </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those who are </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">born, just as one who takes a vow </span>not to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those who are born </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those who will be born, </span>because Rabbi Meir claims that the one taking the vow was precise in his words.
With regard to the distinction between the terms in the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Is this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to say that </span>the word <span class="gemarra-italic">noladim</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> means those who will be born </span>in the future? <span class="gemarra-regular">But if that is so, </span>it says in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Your two sons who were born [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">noladim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to you in the land of Egypt” </span>(Genesis 28:5), <span class="gemarra-regular">does it also </span>mean <span class="gemarra-regular">those who will be born? </span>The verse is referring to Manasseh and Ephraim, who were already alive. 
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">But rather, what </span>should one say; <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the expression <span class="gemarra-regular">means those already born? However, if that is so, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “Behold, a son shall be born [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nolad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to the house of David, Josiah by name” </span>(I Kings 13:2), is the meaning <span class="gemarra-regular">also that he is already</span> born? <span class="gemarra-regular">But Manasseh had not yet come </span>into this world, and certainly not his grandson Josiah. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>sometimes the word <span class="gemarra-regular">means this, </span>those already born, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>sometimes <span class="gemarra-regular">means that, </span>those who are not yet born, <span class="gemarra-regular">and with regard to vows, follow the colloquial language</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in which the word <span class="it-text">noladim</span> is used to mean those who are not yet born, so the vow is interpreted in this manner.
The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say: He intended </span>to include with this expression <span class="gemarra-regular">only one whose nature is to be born. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What does </span>this term <span class="gemarra-regular">exclude? </span>The Gemara answers: It serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude fish and birds, </span>which are not born but are hatched from eggs, whereas the word <span class="it-text">noladim</span> means those born from their mother’s womb. 

Daf 31a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who takes a vow </span>that deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> those <span class="gemarra-regular">who rest on Shabbat </span>is forbidden to him is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from a Jew, and </span>he is also <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from Samaritans [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Kutim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> because they are also Shabbat observers. One who takes a vow that deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those who eat </span><span class="gemarra-regular">garlic </span>on Shabbat night is forbidden to him is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from a Jew, and </span>he is also <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from benefiting <span class="gemarra-regular">from Samaritans. </span>However, if one takes a vow that deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those who ascend </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">Jerusalem </span>is forbidden to him, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from a Jew, but </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from Samaritans </span>because they do not ascend to Jerusalem, but rather, to Mount Gerizim.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the expression in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Those who rest on Shabbat? If we say </span>that the one who took the vow intended to render forbidden deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those who uphold Shabbat, </span>i.e., who actually observe it, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>mention <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>that he is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>deriving benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">Samaritans; even </span>benefit from other <span class="gemarra-regular">gentiles </span>who are Shabbat observers should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be prohibited? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the intention of the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> was to refer to a case where one took a vow that deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who are commanded about </span>observing <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>is forbidden, and this <span class="it-text">tanna</span> holds that the Samaritans are considered true converts, commanded to observe Shabbat. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, say the latter clause </span>of the mishna: If he takes a vow that deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from those who ascend to Jerusalem </span>is forbidden to him, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from a Jew but permitted </span>to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from Samaritans. Why? But aren’t </span>Samaritans <span class="gemarra-regular">commanded </span>to ascend just like other Jews?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching </span>about those who are <span class="gemarra-regular">commanded and </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">perform </span>a mitzva, and the mishna is to be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">In the first two clauses </span>of the mishna, which concern Shabbat observance and eating garlic, both <span class="gemarra-regular">Jews and Samaritans </span>are included because they are <span class="gemarra-regular">commanded and </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">perform </span>the mitzva. However, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">gentiles, those who perform </span>these mitzvot have the status of those who <span class="gemarra-regular">perform </span>the mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">but are not commanded </span>to do so. Therefore, the one who took the vow is permitted to derive benefit from them. Concerning the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of those who ascend to Jerusalem, a Jew is commanded </span>to keep this mitzva <span class="gemarra-regular">and performs </span>it, while <span class="gemarra-regular">Samaritans </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">commanded but do not perform </span>it, so he is permitted to derive benefit from them. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one says: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">descendants of Noah is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not benefit </span>from it, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from a Jew </span><span class="gemarra-regular">but prohibited </span>from deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from the nations of the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">world</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is a Jew excluded from the category </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">descendants of Noah? </span>They are also descendants of Noah. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since Abraham was sanctified </span>and designated to possess a unique role in the world, all his descendants <span class="gemarra-regular">are called by his name </span>and are no longer termed the descendants of Noah.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one says: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">of the offspring of Abraham </span>is forbidden to me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not benefit </span>from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is prohibited </span>from deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from a Jew but permitted </span>to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from the nations of the world.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Concerning the mishna’s ruling that the one who takes such a vow is permitted to derive benefit from the nations of the world, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t there Ishmael </span>and his descendants, who are also Abraham’s offspring? Why isn’t deriving benefit from them forbidden as well? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is written </span>with regard to Abraham: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For in Isaac shall seed be called to you” </span>(Genesis 21:12), which demonstrates that the descendants of Ishmael are not termed the offspring of Abraham. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t there Esau </span>and his descendants; they are also offspring of Abraham, since they are descendants of Isaac? The Gemara answers that the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“in Isaac” </span>mean that some of Isaac’s descendants, i.e., the children of Jacob, are included in the offspring of Abraham, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not all </span>the descendants of <span class="gemarra-regular">Isaac.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one says: The property of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew is </span>forbidden to me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not benefit </span>from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may purchase </span>items from a Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">for more </span>than the market price <span class="gemarra-regular">and may sell </span>items to a Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">for less </span>than the market price, so that he does not derive benefit from the transactions. If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Benefit from me is </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to a Jew, he may purchase </span>items from a Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">for less </span>than the market price <span class="gemarra-regular">and may sell </span>items to a Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">for more </span>than the market price, so that he does not derive benefit from the transactions. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>although this would be permitted, <span class="gemarra-regular">they do not listen to him, </span>i.e., people will generally not agree to deal with him in a manner that causes them a loss in every transaction. If one says: The property of a Jew is forbidden to me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not benefit from them, and </span>my property is forbidden to a Jew and <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>will not benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from me, </span>in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">he may benefit from the nations of the world </span>but not from a Jew, and a Jew may not benefit from him.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who takes a vessel from a craftsman to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> examine </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and an accident occurs </span>to it while it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hand</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> e.g. it broke, the one who examined it is <span class="gemarra-regular">liable </span>to pay for the damages. Since the one examining the item could have completed the sale at any time, he is treated like a borrower while he examines it, as all the benefit is his. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that in every sale <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>primary <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit </span>belongs to <span class="gemarra-regular">the buyer. </span>The buyer benefits much more than the seller, and therefore he must pay for accidents. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty with Shmuel’s statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna that if one says: The property of <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew is </span>forbidden to me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not benefit </span>from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may sell </span>items to a Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">for less </span>than the market price. The Gemara infers: He may sell at a lesser price, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>selling the items at a price <span class="gemarra-regular">equal </span>to the market price is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if the </span>primary <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit </span>of the sale is to the <span class="gemarra-regular">buyer, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>selling the items at a price <span class="gemarra-regular">equal </span>to the market price should be permitted. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a sale that lies in his face, </span>i.e., an item that arouse no interest among potential buyers. In that case, the seller benefits from the sale even the item is sold at market value, and this is prohibited.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, say the first clause </span>of that <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">He may purchase </span>items from a Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">for more </span>than the market price. If the mishna deals with a case where the seller is glad to sell, why does the buyer need to pay more? He should be permitted to pay the market value. <span class="gemarra-regular">Furthermore, say the latter clause </span>of the mishna: If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Benefit from me is </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to a Jew, he may purchase </span>items from a Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">for less </span>than the market price <span class="gemarra-regular">and may sell </span>items to a Jew <span class="gemarra-regular">for more </span>than the market price. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a sale that lies in his face, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if he sells <span class="gemarra-regular">at the </span>price <span class="gemarra-regular">equal </span>to the purchase price he has more benefit than the buyer, and it should be permitted. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The latter clause </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> the opposite case, in <span class="gemarra-regular">a keen [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥarifa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sale, </span>i.e., one in which the merchandise arouses keen interest among potential buyers. Therefore, the buyer benefits if he pays the market price. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If that is so, </span>that the latter clause is referring to such a case, why should the one who took the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">purchase </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for less </span>than the market price? <span class="gemarra-regular">Even at the </span>price <span class="gemarra-regular">equal </span>to the purchase price it should be permitted, since the merchandise is selling well and the seller derives no benefit from it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>

Daf 31b

it must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna </span>is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with an average sale</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is neither of particularly low quality and difficult to sell nor of particularly high quality and in high demand. Therefore, when it is sold at the fixed price, it cannot be said that either the buyer or seller benefits. Consequently, the one taking the vow must lower the price when selling to those forbidden by the vow and add to the price when buying from them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>by contrast, the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel </span>is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a keen sale, </span>in which a sale at the fixed price is considered to be primarily beneficial to the buyer. 
The Gemara comments: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel </span>that taking an item from the seller to inspect it before purchase is considered like borrowing it. In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who takes utensils from a merchant </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to send them to his father-in-law’s hous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> as a gift <span class="gemarra-regular">and says</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the merchant: <span class="gemarra-regular">If they accept them from me I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">give you their value, and if </span>they do <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>want them, <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">give you </span>a sum of money <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the value of <span class="gemarra-regular">the financial benefit that </span>I received <span class="gemarra-regular">from them,</span> i.e., I will pay something for the benefit that I received from showing my father-in-law that I want to honor him, then if <span class="gemarra-regular">an accident occurs to </span>the utensils <span class="gemarra-regular">on the way </span>to the house of the father-in-law and they are broken, the buyer is <span class="gemarra-regular">liabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to pay because he has the status of a borrower.
But if the father-in-law did not want them and returned them to the seller, and an accident occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">on the return </span>trip, the buyer <span class="gemarra-regular">is exempt because he is like a paid bailee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since the father-in-law decided not to accept them, and the prospective buyer no longer benefits from them, he is not considered to be a borrower, but rather, a paid bailee of these utensils, and a paid bailee is exempt in the case of an accident.
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain middleman [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">safseira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who took a donke</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to sell but it was not sold, </span>i.e., he was unsuccessful in finding a buyer. <span class="gemarra-regular">While he was in the midst of returning </span>the donkey to its owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">an accident occurred </span>to the <span class="gemarra-regular">donkey. Rav Naḥman </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">obligated him to pay </span>for it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman </span>from this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If an accident occurred while on the way, he is liable </span>to pay; if it occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">on the return </span>trip <span class="gemarra-regular">he is exempt. </span>Since the case involving Rav Naḥman occurred on the return trip, why did Rav Naḥman obligate him to pay? 
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: The return </span>trip <span class="gemarra-regular">of a middleman is </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">the trip </span>there, and an item is not considered returned until he actually gives it to its owner. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because were he to find </span>someone <span class="gemarra-regular">to sell </span>the donkey to <span class="gemarra-regular">even at the door of his house, would he not sell it? </span>Therefore, he retains the status of a borrower. However, in the case of bringing a gift to a particular person who does not accept it, the sale is nullified, and the prospective buyer has only to take care of the item until it is returned to its owner, which gives him the status of a paid bailee. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Benefiting from those who are uncircumcised is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from uncircumcised </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Jew</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> because they are not regarded as uncircumcised, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he is prohibited </span>from deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from the circumcised of the nations of the world. </span>
Conversely, if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Benefiting from those who are circumcised </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">he is prohibited </span>from deriving benefit even <span class="gemarra-regular">from uncircumcised Jews and </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from the circumcised of the nations of the world, as </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">uncircumcised is used only to name the nations of the world, as it is stated: “For all the nations are uncircumcised, but all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart” </span>(Jeremiah 9:25), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it says: “And this uncircumcised Philistine shall be” </span>(I Samuel 17:36), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it says: “Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph” </span>(II Samuel 1:20). These verses indicate that ordinary gentiles are referred to as uncircumcised, regardless of whether they are actually circumcised. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: The foreskin is repulsive, as </span>is evident from the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the wicked are disgraced through it, as it is stated: </span>“Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will punish all them that are circumcised in their uncircumcision: Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that have the corners of their hair polled, that dwell in the wilderness; <span class="gemarra-regular">for all the nations are uncircumcised, </span>but all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart” (Jeremiah 9:25), which indicates that there is an element of disgrace associated with the foreskin. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael says: </span>So <span class="gemarra-regular">great is </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumcision that thirteen covenants were sealed with regard to it, </span>for the word covenant appears thirteen times in the biblical passage that discusses circumcision (Genesis, chapter 17). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span>So <span class="gemarra-regular">great is </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumcision that it overrides the strict </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as circumcision is performed even if the eighth day following the birth of a son occurs on Shabbat, despite the fact that circumcision violates the prohibition of labor on Shabbat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: Great is </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumcision, </span>as is evident from the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the punishment of <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses the righteous for </span>not circumcising his son when he was capable of doing so <span class="gemarra-regular">was not postponed </span>for even <span class="gemarra-regular">a full hour </span>(see Exodus 4:24–26). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya says: </span>So <span class="gemarra-regular">great is </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumcision that it overrides </span>the prohibitions associated with <span class="gemarra-regular">leprosy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If leprosy is found on the foreskin of an infant, although it is generally prohibited to cut the afflicted area, it is permitted to do so to perform the mitzva of circumcision. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>So <span class="gemarra-regular">great is </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumcision that </span>despite <span class="gemarra-regular">all the mitzvot that Abraham our Patriarch did, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">was not called wholehearted until he circumcised </span>himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated </span>at the time that the mitzva was given to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Walk before Me and you should be wholehearted” </span>(Genesis 17:1). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">great is </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumcision that if not for it the Holy One, Blessed be He, would not have created His world, as it is stated: “Thus says the Lord: If My covenant be not with day and night, I would not have appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth” </span>(Jeremiah 33:25), and the covenant that exists day and night is the covenant of circumcision, as it is always found on the person’s body.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: </span>So <span class="gemarra-regular">great is </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumcision that all the merits that Moses our teacher </span>accrued when he <span class="gemarra-regular">performed </span>mitzvot <span class="gemarra-regular">did not protect him when he was negligent about </span>performing <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumcision, as it is stated: “And the Lord met him and sought to kill him” </span>(Exodus 4:24). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Heaven forbid that Moses our teacher was neglectful of the </span>mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumcision. Rather, this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">I circumcise</span> the child now <span class="gemarra-regular">and depart </span>to begin my journey, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is a danger </span>for the child, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain” </span>(Genesis 34:25), which indicates that the pain of circumcision lasts for several days and the child may be in danger while in pain. If <span class="gemarra-regular">I circumcise </span>him immediately <span class="gemarra-regular">and wait three days </span>and only then embark on the journey, this is problematic, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to me: “Go, return into Egypt”</span> (Exodus 4:19), i.e., go immediately. For these reasons Moses did not circumcise the child immediately, but no neglect existed on his part. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according to this explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">for what reason was Moses punished? </span>

Daf 32a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Because he was occupied with lodging first </span>and did not immediately perform the mitzva of circumcision, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">“And it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place” </span>(Exodus 4:24).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: It was not Moses our teacher </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Satan wanted to kill, but rather, that infant </span>who was not circumcised, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Surely a bridegroom of blood are you to me” </span>(Exodus 4:25). <span class="gemarra-regular">Go out and see: Who </span>does it make sense would be the one that <span class="gemarra-regular">is called the bridegroo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> in this instance? <span class="gemarra-regular">You must say this is the infant, </span>since he is the one who entered the covenant of Abraham by means of the circumcision.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda bar Bizna taught: At the time that Moses our teacher was negligent about the circumcision, </span>the destructive angels named <span class="gemarra-regular">Af, </span>meaning anger, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Ḥeima, </span>meaning wrath, <span class="gemarra-regular">came and swallowed him, and only his leg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were left </span>outside. <span class="gemarra-regular">Immediately, “Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son” </span>(Exodus 4:25), and <span class="gemarra-regular">immediately “He let him alone” </span>(Exodus 4:26). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">At that moment, Moses our teacher wanted to kill them, as it is stated: “Cease from anger [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">af </span><span class="gemarra-regular">] and forsake wrath [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥeima</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Psalms 37:8), which indicates that he wanted to harm them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And there are those who say: He killed </span>the angel named <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥeima, as it is stated: “Wrath is not in me” </span>(Isaiah 27:4). The Gemara asks: How is it possible to say that he killed Ḥeima? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it written </span>that Moses himself said much later: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For I was in dread of the anger and wrath” </span>(Deuteronomy 9:19)? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There are two </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">wrath. And if you wish, say</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">the army of Ḥeima </span>remained but not the angel itself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Great is </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumcision, for there is no one who was engaged in mitzvot like Abraham our Patriarch, and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">he was called wholehearted only due to </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumcision, as it is stated: “Walk before Me and you should be wholehearted” </span>(Genesis 17:1), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written </span>in the next verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And I will make My covenant between Me and you” </span>(Genesis 17:2), and Abraham was then commanded with regard to circumcision. This indicates that he was not called wholehearted until he performed circumcision. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">great is </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumcision that it is equal to all the mitzvot of the Torah, as it is stated </span>at the giving of the Torah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For according to these word</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> I have made a covenant with you and with Israel” (Exodus 34:27), and “covenant” refers to circumcision. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">great is </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">circumcision that if not for circumcision heaven and earth would not have been established, as it is stated: “If My covenant be not with day and night, </span>I would not have appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth” (Jeremiah 33:25), and the covenant that exists day and night is the covenant of circumcision, as it is always found on the person’s body.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees </span>with the words <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Eliezer, for Rabbi Eliezer said: Great is the Torah, for if not for Torah, heaven and earth would not have been established, as it is stated: “If My covenant be not with day and night, </span>I would not have appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth” (Jeremiah 33:25). According to Rabbi Eliezer, the covenant that exists day and night is the Torah, as it says: “You should contemplate it day and night” (Joshua 1:8).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: At the time that the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Abraham our Patriarch: “Walk before Me and you should be wholehearted” </span>(Genesis 17:1), a sensation of <span class="gemarra-regular">trembling seized him </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: Perhaps there is something disgraceful about me </span>due to a transgression that I committed, and therefore I cannot be called complete. <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>God <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: “And I will make My covenant between Me and you” </span>(Genesis 17:2), <span class="gemarra-regular">his mind was set at ease, </span>since he understood that the removal of the foreskin that he was now commanded to do was the reason he had not yet achieved completion. 
The Gemara expounds the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“and He brought him outside” </span>(Genesis 15:5): Abraham <span class="gemarra-regular">said before Him: Master of the Universe, I looked at my constellation and </span>according to it <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">have only one son, </span>and a son has already been born to me, i.e., Ishmael. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: Emerge from your astrolog</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> because <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no constellation for the Jewish people, </span>as they are not subject to the influence of astrology. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Anyone who conducts himself with wholeheartedness, the Holy One, Blessed be He, treats him with wholeheartedness, as it is stated: “With the devout You act devoutly, and with the one who is strong in his wholeheartedness You act </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wholeheartedly</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(II Samuel 22:26).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Hoshaya said: Anyone who acts wholeheartedly, time will stand for him, </span>i.e., he will be successful, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Walk before Me and you should be wholehearted” </span>(Genesis 17:1), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written: “And you shall be the father of a multitude of nations” </span>(Genesis 17:4). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Anyone who divines, </span>i.e., he guesses and looks for signs about the future, <span class="gemarra-regular">the sign </span>will injure <span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: “For there is to him [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] divination with Jacob”</span> (Numbers 23:23). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But it is written </span><span class="it-text">lo</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>the letters <span class="gemarra-italic">lamed</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">alef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>meaning “no divination,” as opposed to with the letters <span class="it-text">lamed</span> <span class="it-text">vav</span>, meaning “there is to him divination.” The straightforward meaning of the verse is that there is no divination with regard to Jacob. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the reason that he will be injured is not based on the verse but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the concept of <span class="gemarra-regular">measure for measure: </span>Since he attempts to tell his fortune, it injures him. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ahava, son of Rabbi Zeira, teaches: Any person who does not divine </span>his future <span class="gemarra-regular">is brought inside a partitio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> close to God to a place <span class="gemarra-regular">that even the ministering angels cannot enter inside, as it is stated: “For there is no divination with Jacob, neither is there any enchantment with Israel, </span>now it is said to Jacob and Israel what has God wrought” (Numbers 23:23). In other words, matters are revealed to Israel that even the angels do not know, since Israel is closer to God than the angels.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: For what reason was Abraham our Patriarch punished and his children enslaved to Egypt </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">210 years? Because he made a draft [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">angarya</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Torah scholars, as it is stated: “He led forth his trained men, born in his house” </span>(Genesis 14:14). These trained men that he took to war were actually his disciples, who were Torah scholars. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel said: Because he greatly examined [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hifriz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the characteristics of the Holy One, Blessed be He, as it is stated: “Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?” </span>(Genesis 15:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>He was punished <span class="gemarra-regular">because he distanced people from entering under the wings of the Divine Presence, as it is stated </span>that the king of Sodom said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Give me the people and take the goods to yourself” </span>(Genesis 14:21), but Abraham refused to take any goods either. If he had not listened to the king of Sodom and had allowed the people to remain with him, he would have brought the prisoners under the wings of the Divine Presence.
The Gemara returns to discuss one of the verses cited previously: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He led forth [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vayyarek</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] his trained men, born in his house” </span>(Genesis 14:14). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: He showered them [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">horikan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with Tora</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> like someone who pours from one vessel into another, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Shmuel said: He showered them [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">horikan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] with gol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and gave them an abundance of money so that they would go to war with him. 
The Torah states that he took <span class="gemarra-regular">“eighteen and three hundred” </span>(Genesis 14:14) men to war. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami bar Abba said: Eliezer </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">equivalent </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">all of them. There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who say: </span>Only <span class="gemarra-regular">Eliezer is </span>referred to here, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the numerical value </span>of the letters of his name <span class="gemarra-regular">is this </span>amount, i.e., 318. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Ami bar Abba said: Abraham recognized his Creator at the age of three years</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: “Because [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ekev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] Abraham hearkened to My voice” </span>(Genesis 26:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">The numerical value </span>of the letters of the word <span class="it-text">ekev</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">172, </span>indicating that he observed the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> for this many years. If Abraham lived until 175 then his first recognition of the Creator must have been at the age of three.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rami bar Abba said </span>in a similar manner: 

Daf 32b

The letters of the term <span class="gemarra-regular">the Satan [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">haSatan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] in numerical value </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">364, </span>which equals the number of days of the year, except for Yom Kippur, during which he has no power. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rami bar Abba said: It is written “Abram,” and </span>after he was commanded to perform circumcision <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written “Abraham” </span>(Genesis 17:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">Initially the Holy One, Blessed be He, enthroned him</span> as ruler <span class="gemarra-regular">over 243 limbs, </span>which is the numerical equivalent of the letters of the word Abram. <span class="gemarra-regular">And in the end, </span>after he was circumcised, <span class="gemarra-regular">He enthroned him </span>as ruler <span class="gemarra-regular">over 248 limbs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is the numerical equivalent of the letters of the word Abraham.
<span class="gemarra-regular">These are</span> the additional limbs: <span class="gemarra-regular">Two eyes, and two ears, and the tip of the sex organ. </span>Following his circumcision, he had total control over them, and they performed only according to his will. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rami bar Abba said: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “There was a little city and </span>few <span class="gemarra-regular">men </span>in it, and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it. Now there was found in it a man poor and wise, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man” (Ecclesiastes 9:14–15)? <span class="gemarra-regular">“A little city,” this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the body; </span><span class="gemarra-regular">“and few men in it,” this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the limbs; “and there came a great king against it and besieged it,” this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the evil inclination; “and built great bulwarks against it,” these </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">sins. </span>
The Gemara expounds on the next section of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Now there was found in it a man poo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and wise,” this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the good inclination; “and he by his wisdom delivered the city,” this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">repentance and good deeds </span>that are cause by the good inclination. <span class="gemarra-regular">“Yet no man remembere</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that same poor man” </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">that when the evil inclination </span>overcomes the good inclination <span class="gemarra-regular">no one remembers the good inclination. </span>
The Gemara interprets the following verse in a similar homiletical manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Wisdom is a stronghold to the wise man more than ten ruler</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that are in a city” (Ecclesiastes 7:19). <span class="gemarra-regular">“Wisdom is a stronghold to the wise man,” this </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">repentance and good deeds. “More than ten rulers,” </span>these are <span class="gemarra-regular">the two eyes, and two ears, and two hands, and two legs, and the tip of the sex organ, and the mouth, </span>which are the limbs that are used by a person to interact with the world. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zekharya said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: The Holy One, Blessed be He, wanted the priesthood to emerge from Shem, </span>so that his children would be priests, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: </span>“And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine; <span class="gemarra-regular">and he was priest of God the Most High” </span>(Genesis 14:18). <span class="gemarra-regular">Once </span>Melchizedek, traditionally identified as Shem, <span class="gemarra-regular">placed the blessing of Abraham before the blessing of the Omnipresent, </span>He had the priesthood <span class="gemarra-regular">emerge from Abraham </span>in particular, and not from any other descendant of Shem. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is stated: “And he blessed him and said: Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth, and blessed be God the Most High” </span>(Genesis 14:19–20). <span class="gemarra-regular">Abraham said to him: And does one place the blessing of the servant before the blessing of his master? </span>You should have blessed God first. <span class="gemarra-regular">Immediately </span>the Holy One, Blessed be He, <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>the priesthood <span class="gemarra-regular">to Abraham, as it is stated: “The Lord says to my lord: Sit at My right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool”</span> (Psalms 110:1), <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward it is written: “The Lord has sworn, and will not repent: you shall be a priest forever, because you are a king of righteousness [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">al</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">divrati</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">malki</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tzedek</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Psalms 110:4), which is explained homiletically to mean: <span class="gemarra-regular">Due to the </span>improper <span class="gemarra-regular">words [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">divrati</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of Melchizedek, </span>the offspring of Abraham shall be priests of God forever. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is as it is written: “And he was priest of God the Most High” </span>(Genesis 14:18), which emphasizes that <span class="gemarra-regular">he,</span> Melchizedek, <span class="gemarra-regular">is a priest, but his children </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">priests.</span>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The difference between one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hamuddar</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">hana’a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">meḥaveiro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one for whom </span>benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from his food is forbidden by vow </span>concerns <span class="gemarra-regular">only setting foot </span>on the other person’s property <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>borrowing from that person <span class="gemarra-regular">utensils that one does not use </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">preparation of food </span>but for other purposes. Those two benefits are forbidden to the former but permitted to the latter.
Therefore, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one for whom </span>benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from another’s food is forbidden by vow, </span>that person <span class="gemarra-regular">may not lend him </span>utensils used in the preparation of food, e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">a sieve, or a strainer, or a millstone, or an oven. However, he may lend him a garment, or a finger ring, or a cloak, or nose rings, </span>as these are not used in the preparation of food. However, he may not lend them to one for whom benefit from him is forbidden by vow.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> who taught this mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava said: It is Rabbi Eliezer, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer said: Even overlooking [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vittur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> a matter for which one is typically indifferent to the actions of others, e.g., people setting foot on one’s property, <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one prohibited by vow from deriving benefit</span> from another. 
§ We learned in the mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one for whom </span>benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from another’s food is forbidden by vow, </span>that person <span class="gemarra-regular">may not lend him </span>utensils used in the preparation of food. 

Daf 33a

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t he vow </span>that he is prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>partaking of <span class="gemarra-regular">food, </span>and those items are not food items? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: </span>The mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he says: Benefit from your food is forbidden to me, </span>which includes any benefit associated with food. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say that </span>the result of a vow formulated in that manner is that <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not chew wheat </span>kernels belonging to the one from whose food benefit is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">and place </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">on his wound, </span>as that is a benefit that results from food. However, that vow does not render items used in the preparation of food forbidden. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he says: Benefit that leads to </span>preparation of <span class="gemarra-regular">your food is forbidden to me. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: </span>Borrowing from him <span class="gemarra-regular">a sack </span>in which <span class="gemarra-regular">to bring produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or a donkey upon which to bring produce, or even merely a basket</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> each renders <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit that leads to food, </span>and this benefit is forbidden. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa raised a dilemma: </span>If he seeks to borrow <span class="gemarra-regular">a horse </span><span class="gemarra-regular">upon which to </span>ride <span class="gemarra-regular">or a ring with which to be seen </span>when attending a feast, to create the impression that he is wealthy, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the ruling? Is it prohibited to borrow these items, since having them in one’s possession may indirectly result in his being served before others or being served higher-quality food; and therefore, borrowing those items provides benefit that leads to food? With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">traversing and walking on his land </span>that facilitates one’s quick return home, enabling him to eat sooner, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? 
The Gemara proposes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, he may lend him a garment, and a cloak, and nose rings, and finger rings. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of that situation? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>the borrower’s intent <span class="gemarra-regular">to be seen with them, </span>and therefore there is no benefit that leads to food, does this <span class="gemarra-regular">need to be said?</span> The vow rendered only food forbidden. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, isn’t </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>in a case where he borrowed those items <span class="gemarra-regular">to be seen with them, and it is taught </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">he may lend </span>it to <span class="gemarra-regular">him?</span>
The Gemara refutes this. <span class="gemarra-regular">No, actually </span>the mishna is referring to a case where he borrowed those items with the intention <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to be seen </span>with them. In response to the question: Is it necessary to say so, the Gemara answers that it is not necessary to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause: He may not lend him, </span>when listing the matters that may not be loaned, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">taught the latter clause </span>of the mishna with a parallel formulation: <span class="gemarra-regular">He may lend him. </span>Rav Pappa’s dilemma remains unresolved.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any item that one does not use in the preparation of food, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where one rents </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">of that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">kind</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> that item is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden. </span>Meaning, one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow is prohibited from borrowing this type of item from the one who vowed and imposed the prohibition. This is because one can use the money saved by borrowing the item rather than renting it to purchase food.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara states: <span class="gemarra-regular">By inference, </span>one may conclude <span class="gemarra-regular">that the first clause </span>of the mishna, which states that the one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow is prohibited from deriving benefit from utensils used in the preparation of food, e.g., a sieve or a strainer, applies <span class="gemarra-regular">even if </span>they are a place <span class="gemarra-regular">where one does not rent </span>items of that kind but typically lends them at no cost. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tann</span><span class="it-text">a</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>this mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava said: It is Rabbi Eliezer, </span>who maintains that overlooking is prohibited in the case of one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one prohibited by vow from deriving benefit from another, </span>if that other person chooses, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may contribute the half-shekel </span>to the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">on his </span>behalf, <span class="gemarra-regular">and repay his debt, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">return his lost item to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the one prohibited from benefiting is not considered to have benefited from him. In <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where one takes </span><span class="gemarra-regular">paymen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> for returning a lost item, that <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit should fall into </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>Temple property.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna allowed one who vowed and imposed the prohibition to pay the financial obligations of the one who is prohibited by vow to derive benefit from him. Based on this, the Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>repaying his debts is tantamount to <span class="gemarra-regular">merely driving away a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. </span>He is not actually giving him anything. Rather, he is preventing potential future harm. That is not considered a benefit. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>that in performing the actions listed in the mishna one is merely preventing harm? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hoshaya said: This </span>

Daf 33b

<span class="gemarra-regular">is the statement of Ḥana</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> in a dispute pertaining to one who pays the debt of another. Ḥanan holds that he cannot demand to be reimbursed for that payment, since he merely prevented potential damage. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Even if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, it was stated <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to one prohibited by vow from deriving benefit from another </span>who borrowed money, and the creditor stipulated <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that </span>if he so chooses <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">to repa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> the loan. In that case, by repaying the loan, one who vowed and imposed the prohibition did not actually repay his debt.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanan </span>to which the Gemara referred? The Gemara answers that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna: In the case of a husband <span class="gemarra-regular">who went to a country overseas, and one </span>other man <span class="gemarra-regular">arose and supported his wife </span>on his own initiative and then demanded to be reimbursed for that support when the husband returned, <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥanan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: </span>The one who took the initiative to support the wife <span class="gemarra-regular">lost his money, </span>since the husband neither asked him to do so nor committed to compensate him. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The sons of High Priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disagreed with him and said: </span>The one who took the initiative to support his wife <span class="gemarra-regular">will take an oath </span>as to <span class="gemarra-regular">how much he spent and take </span>repayment from the husband. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas said in accordance with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">statement </span>of the sons of High Priests. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said: Ḥanan spoke well</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as in any case of this type <span class="gemarra-regular">he placed his money on the antler of a deer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a risky venture with no guaranteed return.
The Gemara explains the dispute between Rava and Rav Hoshaya with regard to attribution of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava did not say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Ḥanan, <span class="gemarra-regular">as did Rav Hoshaya, </span>and he preferred a different explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he establishes the mishna in accordance with the statements </span>upon which <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone </span>agrees, rather than attributing it to an individual <span class="it-text">tanna</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hoshaya did not say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of all the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as did Rava, </span>as there is basis to issue a rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>prohibiting repayment of a loan for one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that he </span>does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">to repay </span>the loan, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>a standard loan that he is required <span class="gemarra-regular">to repay. </span>Therefore, he prefers to establish the mishna in accordance with the opinion of Ḥanan.
§ We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">He returns his lost item to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi disagree about this. One said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">They taught </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the property of the one returning </span>the lost item <span class="gemarra-regular">is forbidden to the owner of the lost item, as when he returns </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to him he is returning </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">something of his own </span>and is not giving him anything new. Consequently, returning a lost item in no way violates the vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the property of the owner of the lost item is forbidden to the one returning </span>the lost item, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not return </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, </span>as in that case the owner indirectly <span class="gemarra-regular">benefits </span>the one returning the lost item by enabling <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>to acquire the <span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rav Yosef said that the legal status of one tending to the return of a lost item is like that of a paid bailee. Since one who is engaged in a mitzva is exempt from performing another mitzva, while he is tending to the lost item he is exempt from giving charity to a pauper. Since the one returning the lost item profits from engaging in the return of the lost item, it is prohibited for him to do so, as he is prohibited by vow from deriving benefit from the owner of the lost item. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And one said: Even </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the property of the owner of the lost item is forbidden to the one returning </span>the lost item, <span class="gemarra-regular">he returns </span>it to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to the concern <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav Yosef, </span>it is not a concern because it is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncommon </span>for a pauper to happen upon a person just when he is tending to the lost item. Therefore, it cannot be said that there is profit in the return of a lost item. 

Daf 34a

<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: In <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where one takes payment </span>for returning a lost item, the <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit </span>that he receives for returning the item <span class="gemarra-regular">should fall into </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>Temple property. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who says that even </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the property of the owner of the lost item is forbidden to the one returning </span>the lost item, <span class="gemarra-regular">he returns </span>it to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>consistent with <span class="gemarra-regular">that which </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where one takes payment </span>for returning a lost item, the <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit </span>that he receives for returning the item <span class="gemarra-regular">should fall into </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>Temple property.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to the one who says </span>that in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the property of the owner of the lost item is forbidden to the one returning </span>the lost item, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not return </span>it to him, and the mishna is referring exclusively to a case where the property of the one returning the lost object is forbidden to the owner of the lost object, <span class="gemarra-regular">why should the benefit fall into </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>Temple property? It is not prohibited for him to benefit from the property of the owner.
The Gemara answers: The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches about </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of the cases: The property of the one returning the lost object is forbidden to the owner, and the one returning the lost object refuses to accept compensation. In that case, the owner of the lost item benefits from the one returning the lost object by allowing him to keep the compensation. Therefore, the benefit is donated to the Temple treasury.
<span class="gemarra-regular">There are </span>those <span class="gemarra-regular">who teach </span>the dispute <span class="gemarra-regular">in this formulation: Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi disagree about this. One said: They taught </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the property of the owner of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">lost item is forbidden to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one returning </span>the lost item, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the concern <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">peruta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Rav Yosef </span>is not a concern, because it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not common. However, </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the property of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one returning </span>the lost item <span class="gemarra-regular">is forbidden to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">lost item, he may not return </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>in doing so <span class="gemarra-regular">he benefits him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And one said: Even if the property of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one returning </span>the lost item <span class="gemarra-regular">is forbidden to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the lost item, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted</span> to return it to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">as when he returns it, he is returning </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">something of his own </span>and is not giving him anything new.
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: In <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where one takes paymen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> for returning a lost item, the <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit</span> that he receives for returning the item <span class="gemarra-regular">should fall into </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>Temple property. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to the one who says that even if the property of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one returning </span>the lost item <span class="gemarra-regular">is forbidde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the lost item he returns </span>it to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it is necessary to <span class="gemarra-regular">resolve </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">a place </span>where one takes payment.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the property of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one returning </span>the lost item <span class="gemarra-regular">is forbidden </span>to the owner of the lost item <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not return </span>it to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">how does he explain </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> taught with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a place </span>where one takes payment? Since the mishna is referring to a case where the property of the owner of the lost item is forbidden to the one returning the lost item, why is it prohibited for the owner of the lost item to keep the payment? It is not prohibited for him to benefit from the property of the one returning the lost item. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. </span>

Daf 34b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">there was a loaf of ownerless </span>bread <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span>a person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he said: This loaf is consecrated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span><span class="gemarra-regular">took </span>the loaf <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he misused consecrated </span>property. His repayment to the Temple for that misuse is <span class="gemarra-regular">based on </span>the loaf’s <span class="gemarra-regular">entire value.</span> However, if his intent was not to take the loaf for himself but <span class="gemarra-regular">to bequeath it to his sons, he misused the consecrated </span>property, and his repayment to the Temple is <span class="gemarra-regular">based on the discretionary benefit that</span> he derived from the fact that his children are indebted to him for the bequest, as he himself derived no direct benefit from the loaf.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin raised a dilemma before Rava. </span>If one said to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">My loaf </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for you, and </span>then he <span class="gemarra-regular">gave it to him as a gift, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Should one infer: <span class="gemarra-regular">My loaf </span>is forbidden, i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>the loaf <span class="gemarra-regular">is in his possession, that is when it is forbidden, </span>but when he gives him a gift, it is no longer in his possession and it is no longer forbidden? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or, perhaps </span>the inference is: Forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to you, </span>i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he rendered </span>the loaf <span class="gemarra-regular">for him like a consecrated item </span>that is forbidden even after the loaf is no longer in his possession.
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious that although he gave it to </span>the other person <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden. </span>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if that is so, when he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">My loaf </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to you, </span>with emphasis on the word my, <span class="gemarra-regular">what does it </span>come <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude? Does it not </span>come <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he stole it from him, </span>as in that case it is permitted? The same would be true if he gave it to him as a gift. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: No, it </span>comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he invited hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> to eat from the loaf before he vowed. In that case, that part of the loaf that he invited him to eat is his, and the owner cannot render it forbidden. However, even if he invited the other person before he vowed, the entire loaf remains forbidden if he gave it to him as a gift. 

Daf 35a

The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span>Rava. If another person <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Lend me your cow, </span>and the owner answered and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Every <span class="gemarra-regular">cow that I purchased</span> other than this one, which I need, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for you;</span> or if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">My property </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to you if I have a cow other than this one, </span>and in fact, he owns other cows; or if another said to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lend me your spade, </span>and the owner of the spade <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Every <span class="gemarra-regular">spade that I have that I purchased is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for you; </span>or if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">My property </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me if I have a spade other than this one, and it is discovered that he has </span>another spade and the <span class="it-text">konam</span> takes effect, then <span class="gemarra-regular">during the life </span>of the one who vowed, the cow or the spade is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> to the subject of the vow. If the one who vowed <span class="gemarra-regular">died or </span>if the cow or the spade <span class="gemarra-regular">was given to </span>the subject of the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift, it is permitted. </span>Apparently, the <span class="it-text">konam</span> is in effect only as long as the property is in his possession.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: </span>It is referring to a case where it <span class="gemarra-regular">was given to </span>the subject of the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">by another </span>person. The one who vowed did not give him the gift directly. He sold or transferred the item to a third party, who gave it to the subject of the vow as a present. Since the property left the possession of its owner before it was given to the subject of the vow, the prohibition does not take effect upon it.
The Gemara states that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: </span>The language <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precise, as it teaches: That was given to him, and it is not taught: That he gave it to him. </span>This indicates that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies specifically to a gift that was given to him by a third party, but not by the one who vowed.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised a dilemma before Rav Naḥman: Is there </span>liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse of consecrated property in </span>cases of <span class="gemarra-italic">konamot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or not? </span>Since the legal status of an item that was rendered a <span class="it-text">konam</span> is like that of consecrated property in that it is forbidden to the one who one vowed, is it like consecrated property in every sense, including liability for misuse of consecrated property?
Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>him: <span class="gemarra-regular">You learned </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> from a mishna (33a): In <span class="gemarra-regular">a place where one takes payment </span>for returning a lost item, that <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit </span>that he receives for returning the item <span class="gemarra-regular">should fall into </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>Temple property. That is <span class="gemarra-regular">to say, </span>an item forbidden by a <span class="it-text">konam</span> is like <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated property. Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated property there is </span>liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse, so too </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-italic">konamot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> there is </span>liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse.</span>
The Gemara comments on this. This dilemma is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>If one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This loaf is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> to all like <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated property, and he ate it, </span>then, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether he </span>ate it <span class="gemarra-regular">or whether another </span>ate it, the one who ate it <span class="gemarra-regular">misused consecrated property. Therefore, </span>since its status is that of consecrated property, <span class="gemarra-regular">it has </span>the possibility of desanctification through <span class="gemarra-regular">redemption. </span>If one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This loaf is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> me </span>like <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he eats it, he misused consecrated property. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>eats it, <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not misuse consecrated property, </span>as he said: To me. <span class="gemarra-regular">Therefore, it does not have </span>the possibility of desanctification through <span class="gemarra-regular">redemption, </span>since its status is not that of full-fledged consecrated property. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>vows taken in <span class="gemarra-regular">this manner and </span>vows taken <span class="gemarra-regular">in that manner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">misused consecrated property because there is no </span>liability for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse </span>of consecrated objects <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>cases of <span class="gemarra-italic">konamot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Rabbi Meir disagrees and holds that there is liability for misuse in <span class="it-text">konamot</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi: </span>If one said to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">My loaf is </span><span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for you, and he </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">gave it to him as a gift, which </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">misused consecrated property? </span>If you say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let the one who gives </span>the loaf be liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse, </span>why would he be liable; the loaf <span class="gemarra-regular">is not forbidden to him? </span>If you say: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let the one who receives </span>the loaf be liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse, he can say: I wanted </span>to receive <span class="gemarra-regular">a permitted </span>item; <span class="gemarra-regular">I did not want </span>to receive <span class="gemarra-regular">a forbidden </span>item. Since the loaf is forbidden, if I accepted it from you, it was not my intention to do so. Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: The one who receives </span>the loaf is liable for <span class="gemarra-regular">misuse when he utilizes </span>the loaf, as the principle with regard to misuse is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who utilizes consecrated money for non-sacred </span>purposes, <span class="gemarra-regular">when he is under the impression that it is non-sacred, misuses consecrated property. This </span>person who received the loaf <span class="gemarra-regular">also misuses consecrated property. </span>

Daf 35b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna proceeds to list other tasks that one may perform for someone who is prohibited by vow from benefiting from him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he separates his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">terum</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and his tithes, </span>provided that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with the knowledge </span>and consent of the owner of the produce. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he sacrifices for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the bird nests, </span>i.e., pairs of birds, pigeons and turtledoves, <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zavi</span><span class="gemarra-italic">n</span> (see Leviticus 15:13–15); <span class="gemarra-regular">the bird nests of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zavot</span> (see Leviticus 15:28–30); <span class="gemarra-regular">the bird nests of women after childbirth </span>(see Leviticus 12:6–8); <span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offerings; and guilt-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offerings</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. And he teaches him midrash</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">halakhot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">aggadot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but he may not teach him Bible. However, he may teach his sons and daughters Bible. </span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are these priests our </span><span class="gemarra-regular">agent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or agents of Heaven </span>when they perform the Temple service? The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the practical difference </span>whether they are our agents or God’s agents? The Gemara answers: The difference is with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one prohibited by vow from deriving benefit </span>from another. <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say that </span>the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">are our agents, don’t </span>the priests provide <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit </span>for the one for whom benefit is forbidden by vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore, sacrificing that person’s offering is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited? And if you say that they are agents of Heaven, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the status of priests?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>proof to resolve the dilemma, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he sacrifices for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the bird nests of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zavin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, etc. </span>The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that the priests are <span class="gemarra-regular">our agents, </span>the priests would thereby provide <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit </span>to one for whom benefit from them is forbidden. Based on the ruling in the mishna, apparently, priests are agents of Heaven.
The Gemara rejects the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to your reasoning, </span>that the mishna holds that priests are agents of Heaven, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>in general: <span class="gemarra-regular">He sacrifices for him offerings. </span>Why did the mishna list these particular offerings? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>perforce, offerings brought by <span class="gemarra-regular">those lacking atonemen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">are different </span>from other offerings, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Everyone </span>who brings an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">requires knowledg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and intent in order to bring the offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">except</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for those lacking atonement, </span>who bring the offering in order to complete their purification. This can be proven from the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that a person brings </span>a purification <span class="gemarra-regular">offering for his minor sons and daughters, </span>although they lack halakhic intelligence, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">“This is the law of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>(Leviticus 15:32). This apparently superfluous verse comes to teach that the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the <span class="it-text">zav</span> apply to <span class="gemarra-regular">both an adult and a minor. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if that is so </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Yoḥanan, </span>with regard to that which is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“This is the law of a woman after childbirth” </span>(Leviticus 12:7), would he interpret that the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of a woman after childbirth apply to <span class="gemarra-regular">both an adult and a minor? Is a minor capable of </span>giving <span class="gemarra-regular">birth? But didn’t Rav Beivai teach </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Naḥman: </span>It is permitted for <span class="gemarra-regular">three women </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">engage in intercourse with </span>a contraceptive <span class="gemarra-regular">resorbent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> A minor, and a pregnant </span>woman, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a nursing </span>woman; <span class="gemarra-regular">a minor </span>may do so <span class="gemarra-regular">lest she conceive and die. </span>Apparently, a minor is incapable of giving birth, as she would die first. 
The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“This is the law of a woman after childbirth,” </span>does not come to include a minor. Rather, it comes to teach that the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of a woman after childbirth apply to <span class="gemarra-regular">both a halakhically competent woman and a woman </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> imbecile, as a man brings an offering for his wife who is an imbecile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: A man brings the offering of a wealthy person for his wife</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as well as all offerings that she is obligated </span>to bring. A wealthy woman after childbirth brings a lamb as a burnt-offering and a dove or turtledove as a sin-offering. A poor woman brings two turtledoves or two pigeons, one as a burnt-offering and one as a sin-offering. Even if the woman is poor, and based on her usufruct property, she would bring the offering of the poor; if her husband is wealthy, he brings the offering of a wealthy person on her behalf. And he must bring on her behalf all the offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">for which she is obligated.</span>
The fact that he is obligated to bring a wealthy person’s offering on her behalf is due to the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">he writes </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">her </span>marriage contract: <span class="gemarra-regular">And responsibility </span>to pay any financial obligations <span class="gemarra-regular">that you have </span>incurred <span class="gemarra-regular">before this </span>moment <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>incumbent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon me. </span>Offerings that she is obligated to bring are included in those obligations, irrespective of her degree of halakhic competence. The offering of a woman after childbirth is one of the offerings brought by those lacking atonement. Therefore, even if priests are our agents, they may sacrifice the offering on behalf of the woman; since they may do so without her knowledge and intent, no agency is required. Therefore, there is no proof from the mishna that priests are agents of Heaven. 

Daf 36a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Shimi bar Abba raised an objection </span>from the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> (2:7): <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the one who vowed to prohibit another from benefiting from him <span class="gemarra-regular">was a priest, he may sprinkle the blood of his sin-offering and the blood of his guilt-offering on </span>the other’s behalf. Apparently, the priest may perform all sacrificial rites for one prohibited from benefiting from him, even those that require knowledge of the one for whom the offering atones.
The Gemara answers. The reference is to <span class="gemarra-regular">blood of the sin-</span><span class="gemarra-regular">offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of a leper and blood</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the guilt-offering of a leper. </span>These are offerings brought by a leper who is lacking atonement, in order to complete his purification process, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “This is the law of the leper” </span>(Leviticus 14:2). And the verse comes to teach that the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of a leper apply to <span class="gemarra-regular">both an adult and a minor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This offering, too, does not require the knowledge of the one for whom the offering atones.
The Gemara cites another proof to resolve the dilemma with regard to the nature of the agency of a priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">priests who rendered </span>an offering <span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the Temple</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., they sacrificed an offering intending to consume it after its appointed time, if <span class="gemarra-regular">they did </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">intentionally, </span>i.e., with full awareness of the period during which the offering may be consumed, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are obligated </span>to pay. The Gemara infers: If <span class="gemarra-regular">they did </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">unwittingly, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">they are exempt </span>from payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>in any event, when <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>rendered the offering <span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>it acquired the status of <span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span> and is disqualified.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, if you say </span>that the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">are agents of Heaven, this is </span>why when <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>actions cause <span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span> it is <span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>their actions are independent of the one bringing the offering. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if you say </span>that the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">are our agents, why </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>actions cause <span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span> is it <span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Let </span>the one bringing the offering <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>the priest: <span class="gemarra-regular">I designated you an agent to perform </span>the task <span class="gemarra-regular">properly but not to perform </span>the task <span class="gemarra-regular">improperly. </span>
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is different with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">piggul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, as </span>in its regard <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states </span>and emphasizes: “He who offered it, <span class="gemarra-regular">it will not be imputed to him” </span>(Leviticus 7:18). This implies that it is <span class="it-text">piggul</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in any case, </span>e.g., even if one’s actions cause the offering to be <span class="it-text">piggul</span> without the consent of the owner. Therefore, there is no proof with regard to the nature of the agency of the priest. 
§ With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Everyone </span>who brings an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">requires knowledge, except for </span>those offerings brought by <span class="gemarra-regular">those lacking atonement; </span>this can be proven from the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">a person brings </span>a purification <span class="gemarra-regular">offering for his minor sons and daughters. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if that is so, let a person bring a sin-offering on </span>behalf of <span class="gemarra-regular">another who unwittingly ate </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">fa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> without his knowledge, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as a man brings </span>an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">for his wife who is an imbecile, in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda. Why </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">did Rabbi Elazar say: </span>One who <span class="gemarra-regular">separated a sin-offering on </span>behalf of <span class="gemarra-regular">anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> who unwittingly ate forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">fat has done nothing?</span>
The Gemara refutes the analogy between the cases. <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances of </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife who is an imbecile? If she ate </span>the forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">fat when she was an imbecile, she is not subject </span>to liability to bring <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering, </span>as one lacking halakhic competence is exempt from punishment and needs no atonement. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if she ate </span>the forbidden fat <span class="gemarra-regular">when she was </span>halakhically <span class="gemarra-regular">competent and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">became an imbecile, didn’t Rabbi Yirmeya say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one ate </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">fat </span>unwittingly, <span class="gemarra-regular">and separated an offering, and became an imbecile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and became competent again, the offering is disqualified. Since it was disqualified </span>when he was demented, <span class="gemarra-regular">it will be disqualified </span>forever. It is clear, therefore, that the sin-offering that one brings for his wife who is an imbecile is not a sin-offering for eating forbidden fat, as that would require halakhic intelligence. It is merely for completion of the purification process, e.g., a woman after childbirth, for which halakhic competence is not required. Therefore, no proof may be cited from the case of one’s wife who is an imbecile to the case of bringing a sin-offering on behalf of another who ate fat.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, if that is so, let a person bring a Paschal lamb on </span>behalf of <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>without his knowledge, <span class="gemarra-regular">just as a person brings </span>a Paschal lamb <span class="gemarra-regular">for his minor sons and daughters.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Why </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">did Rabbi Elazar say: </span>One who <span class="gemarra-regular">separated a Paschal lamb on </span>behalf of <span class="gemarra-regular">anothe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> has done nothing?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: </span>The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“A lamb for each father’s house, </span>a lamb for the household” (Exodus 12:3). From here it is derived that all members of a household, including minor sons and daughters, are registered to the group eating a Paschal lamb. However, this is a custom; it <span class="gemarra-regular">is not by Torah law. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>is this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> learned? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">from that which we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Pesaḥim</span> 89a): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to his </span>minor <span class="gemarra-regular">sons: I am hereby slaughtering the Paschal lamb on </span>behalf of <span class="gemarra-regular">the one of you who will ascend to Jerusalem first, </span>and he will be privileged to eat from that lamb, then <span class="gemarra-regular">once the first </span>of his children <span class="gemarra-regular">introduces his head and most </span>of his body into Jerusalem, <span class="gemarra-regular">he acquires his portion and acquires </span>portions <span class="gemarra-regular">on behalf of his brothers with him. And if you say </span>that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> derived from the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“a lamb for the household” is by Torah law, </span>and the minors are obligated to register for the Paschal lamb, although the son who reached Jerusalem first acquired his portion based on the stipulation of his father, how can <span class="gemarra-regular">he stand over the meat </span>of the Paschal lamb after it was slaughtered <span class="gemarra-regular">and acquire it on behalf of </span>his brothers? Apparently, minors are not required by Torah law to register as members of the group eating the Paschal lamb. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, why do they </span>require <span class="gemarra-regular">that their father say to them: </span>The one of you who will ascend to Jerusalem first will be privileged to eat from that lamb, when no actual acquisition takes place? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to motivate them in </span>the performance of <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot. This is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">There was an incident </span>that transpired where a father said to his sons and daughters that they should compete to see who reaches the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb first, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the daughters preceded the sons, and the daughters were found </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">motivated and the sons </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">lazy [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shefalim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> did not say that the result was that daughters acquired their portion, apparently the father’s statement was merely motivational.
§ We learned in the mishna that among the tasks that one may perform for someone who is prohibited by vow from benefiting from him is: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he separates his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>

Daf 36b

<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who separates </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from his own </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>behalf of the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">of another,</span> does he <span class="gemarra-regular">require the knowledge </span>and consent of the owner of the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">or not? Do we say: Since it is a benefit for </span>the other to have his produce tithed, <span class="gemarra-regular">it does not require his knowledge, </span>as one may act in a person’s interest in his absence? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or, perhaps it is his mitzva, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">preferable for him to perform </span>the mitzva himself, and therefore, it does not benefit him to have the produce tithed on his behalf.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the mishna: For one for whom benefit from him is forbidden by vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">he separates his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and his tithes, </span>provided that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with his knowledge </span>and consent. The Gemara analyzes this statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing? If we say </span>that he separates <span class="it-text">teruma</span> from the produce of the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the pile for </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the pile, </span>the question is: <span class="gemarra-regular">And with the knowledge </span>and consent <span class="gemarra-regular">of whom </span>may he do so? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with the knowledge </span>of the one tithing the produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">who designated him an agent </span>to do so? One cannot tithe another’s produce unless he is designated as an agent. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that he is tithing <span class="gemarra-regular">with the knowledge of the owner of the pile. </span>However, in that case, by tithing the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t he benefiting </span>the owner, as <span class="gemarra-regular">he is performing </span>the action in fulfillment of the <span class="gemarra-regular">agency </span>of the owner? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it must be that he separates <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from his own </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>behalf of the produce of the owner of <span class="gemarra-regular">the pile. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And with the knowledge </span>and consent <span class="gemarra-regular">of whom </span>is he doing so? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with the knowledge of the owner of the pile, isn’t he benefiting </span>the owner? He is performing the action in fulfillment of the agency of the owner. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>that he is tithing <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>the basis of <span class="gemarra-regular">his own knowledge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he is separating from his own </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">on </span>behalf of <span class="gemarra-regular">the produce of another? And if you say that </span>in order to tithe from one’s produce on behalf of the produce of the owner, it <span class="gemarra-regular">requires </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge </span>and consent, <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t he benefiting </span>the owner? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>that one may conclude from here that in order to tithe from one’s produce on behalf of the produce of another, one <span class="gemarra-regular">does not require </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge </span>and consent of the owner of the pile?
The Gemara rejects that conclusion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>it is a case where he separates <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the produce of the <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the pile for </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">owner of the pile. </span>However, the circumstances here are parallel to those addressed by Rava in another context, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rava said </span>that there is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one says: Anyone who wishes to come and separate </span><span class="gemarra-italic">terum</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">may come and separate </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Here too, </span>this is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one says: </span>Anyone who wishes to come and separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span> may come and separate <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. In that case, one may tithe another’s produce without being designated as his agent.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma before Rabbi Zeira: </span>In a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">one separates </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from his own </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">of another, who </span>is entitled to <span class="gemarra-regular">the discretionary benefit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the right to give the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> to the priest of his choosing? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say: If not for the produce of this </span>one separating the <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">would the pile of that </span>owner of the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">be properly tithed, </span>and therefore the one separating the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> is entitled to the discretionary benefit? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or, perhaps </span>we say: <span class="gemarra-regular">If not for the pile of that </span>owner of the pile, <span class="gemarra-regular">the produce of this </span>one separating the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">would not be </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and therefore the owner is entitled to the discretionary benefit.
Rabbi Zeira <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that as <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: </span>“You shall tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">all the produce of your seed…and you shall give” </span>(Deuteronomy 14:22, 26), this indicates that the discretion to give the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> to the priest of his choosing is the prerogative of the one to whom the pile of the produce belongs.
Rabbi Yirmeya <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection to </span>Rabbi Zeira from the mishna: For someone who is prohibited by vow from benefiting from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">he separates his </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and his tithes, </span>provided that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">with the knowledge </span>and consent of the owner of the produce. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">the discretionary benefit </span>belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to the owner of the pile, </span>by separating <span class="it-text">teruma</span> for his produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t he benefiting </span>the owner? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, conclude from </span>the mishna that the right to <span class="gemarra-regular">the discretionary benefit </span>belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the one separating the <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> No, </span>actually this could even be a case where one separates <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">of the owner of the pile for </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">of the owner of the pile, and</span> he does so with the <span class="gemarra-regular">knowledge of the owner of the pile, where he says: Anyone who wishes to come and separate </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may come and separate </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution of Rabbi Yirmeya’s dilemma, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Abbahu said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>In a case where one consecrates an animal as an offering for another and it becomes blemished, only <span class="gemarra-regular">the one who consecrates </span>the animal <span class="gemarra-regular">adds one-fift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> to the cost of redeeming the animal, and the one seeking atonement through this offering does not. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>since the body of the animal belongs to <span class="gemarra-regular">the one seeking atonement </span>through the offering, only he <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>a non-sacred animal exchanged for the sacred animal, consecrated as <span class="gemarra-regular">a substitute</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who separates </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from his own </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">that is not his, the discretionary benefit is his</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
§ We learned in the mishna that one <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>someone who is prohibited by vow from benefiting from him <span class="gemarra-regular">midrash, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakhot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">aggadot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but he may not teach him Bible. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not teach him Bible? </span>Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the teacher <span class="gemarra-regular">benefits </span>the one for whom benefit from him is forbidden by teaching him Bible? When he teaches him <span class="gemarra-regular">midrash he also benefits him. Shmuel said: </span>The mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a place where one takes payment for </span>teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">Bibl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one does not take payment for </span>teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">midrash. </span>By teaching him Bible, the one for whom benefit is forbidden, benefits from the fact that he does not pay. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>was the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> stated <span class="gemarra-regular">without qualification? </span>There is no apparent fundamental difference between Bible and midrash. Why did the mishna refer specifically to a case where payment is taken for teaching Bible? 

Daf 37a

The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This teaches us that even in a place where one takes payment </span>for teaching, <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">Bible </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to take </span>payment, but <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">midrash </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not permitted to take </span>payment.
The Gemara asks: In <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">is midrash different </span>from Bible, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>take payment for teaching it? Based on that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written, </span>which Moses said to the people: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you </span>statutes and laws” (Deuteronomy 4:14), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also that which <span class="gemarra-regular">is written: “Behold, I have taught you statutes and laws, as the Lord </span>my God <span class="gemarra-regular">commanded me, </span>that you should do so in the midst of the land where you go in to possess it” (Deuteronomy 4:5), God said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as I </span>teach you <span class="gemarra-regular">for free</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> without payment, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too you also </span>shall teach <span class="gemarra-regular">for free. </span>There should be no difference between Bible and midrash, and <span class="gemarra-regular">Bible too, </span>like midrash, should be taught <span class="gemarra-regular">for free. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>As Bible is typically taught to children, one who teaches Bible takes <span class="gemarra-regular">payment </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">watching </span>the children. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>He takes <span class="gemarra-regular">payment </span>for teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">punctuation </span>of the text with <span class="gemarra-regular">cantillation notes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna that one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by a vow, that other person <span class="gemarra-regular">may not teach him Bible. Granted, according to the one who says</span> that the <span class="gemarra-regular">payment </span>is for teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">punctuation </span>of the text with <span class="gemarra-regular">cantillation notes, this is </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that he shall not teach him Bible, </span>as teaching punctuation is a component of teaching the biblical text. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to the one who says</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">payment </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">watching </span>the students, <span class="gemarra-regular">is an adult one who requires watching, </span>and would payment be taken for doing so? Since the teacher typically does not receive payment for teaching adults, there is no benefit when he teaches for free the one for whom benefit is forbidden; why, then, is it prohibited? The Gemara answers: The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching </span>about the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of a minor </span>who requires watching and who is prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit from the teacher. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of a minor, say the latter clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, he may teach his sons Bible. Is a minor one </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">capable of </span>bearing <span class="gemarra-regular">sons? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna is incomplete, and this </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">it is teaching</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">He may not teach him Bible,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a minor. If </span>the student <span class="gemarra-regular">is an adult, he may teach him and his sons Bible. </span>He may teach him because he does not require watching, and he may teach his son because the payment is for watching his son.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Children may not read </span>a passage in the Bible <span class="gemarra-regular">for the first </span>time <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat; however, they may review </span>a passage that they already learned <span class="gemarra-regular">once. Granted, according to the one who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">payment </span>for teaching Bible is for teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">punctuation </span>of the text with <span class="gemarra-regular">cantillation notes, this is </span>the reason that <span class="gemarra-regular">children may not read </span>a passage in the Bible <span class="gemarra-regular">for the first </span>time <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat, </span>as it would be necessary to pay the teacher. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to the one who says</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">payment </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">watching </span>the children, <span class="gemarra-regular">why may </span>children <span class="gemarra-regular">not read </span>a passage in the Bible <span class="gemarra-regular">for the first </span>time <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat? And why may </span>children <span class="gemarra-regular">review </span>a passage that they already learned <span class="gemarra-regular">once?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Isn’t there payment </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">watching </span>the children <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat </span>in both cases? 
The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to your reasoning, is </span>receiving <span class="gemarra-regular">payment </span>for teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">punctuation </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited on Shabbat? It is </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">incorporation </span>of the payment for teaching on Shabbat into the teacher’s weekly salary, <span class="gemarra-regular">and incorporation is permitted, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who hires </span>a day <span class="gemarra-regular">laborer to watch a child, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to watch a cow, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">to guard seeds does not give him payment for Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Therefore, </span>

Daf 37b

<span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the items that the laborer was entrusted to watch <span class="gemarra-regular">were lost </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bear </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility </span>to compensate the owners <span class="gemarra-regular">for them, </span>since he is not a paid bailee on that day. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>he is a laborer <span class="gemarra-regular">hired for a week, hired for a month, hired for a year, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">hired for seven years, </span>the one who hired him <span class="gemarra-regular">gives him payment </span>for labor performed on <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>as well. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the items <span class="gemarra-regular">were lost </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">he bears </span>financial <span class="gemarra-regular">responsibility </span>to compensate the owners <span class="gemarra-regular">for them. </span>If payment for Shabbat is incorporated within payment for a longer period, it is not prohibited to accept payment for permitted actions performed on Shabbat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, with regard to Shabbat, this is the reason that </span>children <span class="gemarra-regular">may not read </span>a passage in the Bible <span class="gemarra-regular">for the first </span>time on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that the fathers of the children will be at leisur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>fulfill <span class="gemarra-regular">the mitzva of </span>delighting in <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat. </span>Teaching new material to their children would occupy more of their fathers’ time, limiting their opportunity to fulfill that mitzva. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">Due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that on Shabbat </span>children <span class="gemarra-regular">eat and drink </span>more than they are accustomed to eating, <span class="gemarra-regular">their world is heavy upon them, </span>i.e., their head and their limbs are sluggish, and they are incapable of concentrating and studying well, <span class="gemarra-regular">as Shmuel said: A change in routine [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">veset</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>in eating and the like causes <span class="gemarra-regular">the onset of an intestinal ailment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the one who says </span>that the payment for teach-ing Bible is <span class="gemarra-regular">payment </span>for teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">punctuation </span>of the text with <span class="gemarra-regular">cantillation notes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore in the case of one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow, that other person may not teach his sons and daughters Bible, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not say </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">payment </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">watching </span>the children? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He holds: Do girls need watching? </span>They stay home and are not accustomed to going out.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the one who says </span>that the payment for teaching Bible is <span class="gemarra-regular">payment </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">watching </span>the children, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is the reason </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not say </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">payment </span>for teaching <span class="gemarra-regular">punctuation </span>of the text with <span class="gemarra-regular">cantillation notes? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the punctuation </span>of the text with <span class="gemarra-regular">cantillation notes is by Torah law; </span>therefore, it is included in the prohibition against taking payment for teaching Torah.
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Ika bar Avin said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥananel said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “And they read in the book, in the Torah of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading” </span>(Nehemiah 8:8)? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">“They read in the book, in the Torah of God”; that is the Bible. “Distinctly”; that is </span>the Aramaic <span class="gemarra-regular">translation. “And they gave the sense”; these are the </span>division into <span class="gemarra-regular">verses. “And caused them to understand the reading”; this is punctuation </span>of the text with <span class="gemarra-regular">cantillation notes, </span>which facilitate the understanding of the verses. <span class="gemarra-regular">And some say: These are the tradition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that determine the proper vocalization of the Bible. Rav holds that the cantillation notes are an integral part of Torah study.
On a related note, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The vocalization of the scribes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the ornamentation of the scribes, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the verses with words that are <span class="gemarra-regular">read but not written, and </span>those that are <span class="gemarra-regular">written but not read </span>are all <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> transmitted <span class="gemarra-regular">to Moses from Sinai. </span>
The Gemara elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">The vocalization of the scribes </span>is referring to words that when they appear at the end of phrases, clauses, or verses, their vocalization changes, e.g., <span class="it-text">eretz</span> with a <span class="it-text">segol</span> under the letter <span class="it-text">alef</span> to <span class="gemarra-italic">aretz</span> with a <span class="it-text">kamatz</span> under the letter <span class="it-text">alef</span>; <span class="it-text">shamayim</span> with a <span class="it-text">pataḥ</span> under the letter <span class="it-text">mem</span>, to <span class="gemarra-italic">shamayim</span> with a <span class="it-text">kamatz</span> under the letter <span class="it-text">mem</span>; and <span class="it-text">mitzrayim</span> with a <span class="it-text">pataḥ</span> under the letter <span class="it-text">reish</span>, to <span class="gemarra-italic">mitzrayim</span> with a <span class="it-text">kamatz</span> under the letter <span class="it-text">reish</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The ornamentation of the scribe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> are expressions that the scribes understood in a manner that differs slightly from its plain understanding. For example: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Then [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aḥar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] go on” </span>(Genesis 18:5); <span class="gemarra-regular">“then [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aḥar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] she will go” </span>(Genesis 24:55); <span class="gemarra-regular">“afterward [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">aḥar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] you will be gathered” </span>(Numbers 31:2); <span class="gemarra-regular">“the singers go before, the minstrels follow after [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Psalms 68:26); <span class="gemarra-regular">“Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains” </span>(Psalms 36:7). 
Words that are <span class="gemarra-regular">read but not written </span>are included in the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> transmitted to Moses from Sinai. For example, the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“Euphrates” that </span>is in the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“as he went </span>to establish his control over the river Euphrates” (II Samuel 8:3) is not written in the text of the Bible. The same is true for the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“man” that </span>is in the verse “now the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counseled in those days, <span class="gemarra-regular">was as if a man inquired of the word of God” </span>(II Samuel 16:23); and for the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“come” that </span>is in the verse “behold, the days come, says the Lord, that the city <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be built </span>to the Lord from the tower of Hananel unto the gate of the corner” (Jeremiah 31:37); and for <span class="gemarra-regular">“her” </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is in the phrase “let her not have <span class="gemarra-regular">escape” </span>(Jeremiah 50:29); <span class="gemarra-regular">unto that </span>is in the verse “it has <span class="gemarra-regular">been told me, </span>all that you have done unto your mother-in-law” (Ruth 2:11); and for <span class="gemarra-regular">“to me” that </span>is found in the passage “and she said unto her: All that you say to me I will do. And she went down to <span class="gemarra-regular">the threshing floor” </span>(Ruth 3:4–5); and for <span class="gemarra-regular">“to me” that </span>is in the verse “he gave me these six measures of <span class="gemarra-regular">barley; </span>for he said to me” (Ruth 3:17). <span class="gemarra-regular">These </span>words <span class="gemarra-regular">are read but not written. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>there are words that are <span class="gemarra-regular">written but not read. </span>For example, the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“may” that </span>is in the verse “may God <span class="gemarra-regular">forgive </span>your servant” (II Kings 5:18) appears in the Bible text but is not vocalized. 

Daf 38a

The same is true for <span class="gemarra-regular">“this” that </span>is in the verse “and this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the mitzva” </span>(Deuteronomy 6:1); and for <span class="gemarra-regular">“bend” that </span>is in the verse “let <span class="gemarra-regular">the archer </span>bend his bow” (Jeremiah 51:3); and for <span class="gemarra-regular">“five” that </span>is in the verse “and <span class="gemarra-regular">the south side </span>four thousand and five hundred” (Ezekiel 48:16); and for <span class="gemarra-regular">“if” that </span>is in the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“that </span>if I am <span class="gemarra-regular">a near kinsman” </span>(Ruth 3:12). All <span class="gemarra-regular">these are written but not read.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Adda said: In the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, they <span class="gemarra-regular">divide this vers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into three verses: “And the Lord said to Moses, behold I come to you in a thick cloud, </span>that the people may hear as I speak with you, and may also believe in you forever; and Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord” (Exodus 19:9).
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Moses became wealthy only from the waste </span>remaining <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>hewing <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Tablets</span> of the Covenant, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Hew for you two tablets of stone like the first” </span>(Exodus 34:1). “Hew for you” means that <span class="gemarra-regular">their waste shall be yours. </span>As the tablets were crafted from valuable gems, their remnants were similarly valuable.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: The Torah was given </span>initially <span class="gemarra-regular">only to Mose</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and his descendants,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: “Write for you” </span>(Exodus 34:27), and it is also stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Hew for you” </span>(Exodus 34:1), meaning: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as their waste is yours, so too their writing is yours. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">Moses treated </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">with generosity and gave it to the Jewish people. And about him, the verse says:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “He that has a bountiful eye shall be blessed, </span>as he gives of his bread to the poor” (Proverbs 22:9).
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda raised an objection </span>from the verse that states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you </span>statutes and laws” (Deuteronomy 4:14). This indicates that Moses was commanded to teach Torah to the Jewish people from the outset. The Gemara answers: The verse means: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Lord commanded </span>the Torah to <span class="gemarra-regular">me, </span>Moses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I, </span>on my own initiative, decided <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>teach <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>its statutes and laws. The Gemara cites an additional verse proving that God commanded to teach the Jewish people from the outset: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Behold, I have taught you statutes and laws, as the Lord my God commanded me” </span>(Deuteronomy 4:5). The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Lord commanded </span>the Torah to <span class="gemarra-regular">me, </span>Moses, <span class="gemarra-regular">and I </span>decided <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>teach <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>statutes and laws. 
The Gemara cites an additional verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Now therefore write this song for you, </span>and teach it the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 31:19). Apparently, Moses was commanded to teach the Torah to the Jewish people. The Gemara answers: The verse is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the song </span>of <span class="it-text">Ha’azinu</span> (Deuteronomy 31) <span class="gemarra-regular">alone </span>and not to the rest of the Torah. The Gemara asks: But the continuation of that cited verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“That this song may be a witness for Me among the children of Israel” </span>(Deuteronomy 31:19), indicates that the reference is to the entire Torah, in which the mitzvot are written. Rather, the Torah was given from the outset to all of the Jewish people, and when Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said that the Torah was given exclusively to Moses, he was referring <span class="gemarra-regular">merely </span>to the <span class="gemarra-regular">profound analysis </span>of the Torah. Moses opted to teach it to the people on his own initiative. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, rests His Divine Presence only upon </span>one who is <span class="gemarra-regular">mighty, and wealthy, and wise, and humble</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And all of these </span>qualities are derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from Moses. </span>He was <span class="gemarra-regular">mighty, as it is written: “And he spread the tent over the Tabernacle” </span>(Exodus 40:19), <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Master said: Moses, our teacher, spread it </span>himself. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is written: “Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, </span>and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board” (Exodus 26:16). Moses was tall and strong enough to spread the tent over the boards alone. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say that he was tall and thin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the fact that he was mighty cannot be derived. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the fact that Moses was mighty is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from this verse, as it is written: “And I took hold of the two tablets, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them </span>before your eyes” (Deuteronomy 9:17), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">The tablets, their length was six </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">and their width was six </span>handbreadths, <span class="gemarra-regular">and their thickness was three </span>handbreadths. If Moses was capable of lifting and casting a burden that heavy, apparently he was mighty. 
Moses was <span class="gemarra-regular">wealthy, </span>as it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Hew for you” </span>(Exodus 34:1), from which it was derived: The <span class="gemarra-regular">waste </span>of the Tablets of the Covenant <span class="gemarra-regular">shall be yours, </span>and that waste consisted of precious stones. That Moses <span class="gemarra-regular">was wise </span>is derived from the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel, who both say: Fifty measures of understanding were created in the world</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and all were given to Moses except one, as it is stated: “Yet you have deprived him of little, of God” </span>(Psalms 8:6). He lacked only complete knowledge of God. Moses was <span class="gemarra-regular">humble, as it is written: “Now the man Moses was very humble” </span>(Numbers 12:3).
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> All the prophets were wealthy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> From where do we </span>derive this? It is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from Moses, and from Samuel, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">from Amos, and from Jonah, </span>who were all wealthy.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Moses </span>was wealthy, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “I have not taken one donkey from them” </span>(Numbers 16:15). The Gemara analyzes the statement of Moses. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he said that he did not take a donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">without payment, </span>was his intent <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>himself from the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who takes </span>items that belong to others <span class="gemarra-regular">without paying? </span>That is obvious, as one who does so is a thief. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>he said <span class="gemarra-regular">that even with payment </span>he did not take a donkey. Apparently, he was wealthy and did not need to purchase anything. The Gemara rejects this proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps, </span>on the contrary, he did not purchase a donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">because he was poor </span>and could not afford it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is derived from the verse written with regard to the Tablets of the Covenant: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Hew for you” </span>(Exodus 34:1), which indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">their waste shall be yours. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Samuel </span>was wealthy, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “Here I am; witness against me before the Lord, and before His anointed: Whose ox have I taken, or whose donkey have I taken?” </span>(I Samuel 12:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he is saying that he did not take an ox or a donkey <span class="gemarra-regular">for free, </span>was his intent <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude </span>himself from the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who takes</span> items that belong to others <span class="gemarra-regular">for free? Rather, </span>he is saying <span class="gemarra-regular">that even with payment </span>he did not take a donkey or an ox. Apparently, he was wealthy. The Gemara rejects this proof. <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps, </span>on the contrary, the reason he did not purchase the donkeys is due to the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that he was poor. Rather, </span>the fact that Samuel was wealthy is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from here, </span>as it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And his return was to Ramah, for there was his house” </span>(I Samuel 7:17). <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava said: Everywhere he went, his home was with him. </span>He was so wealthy that he could afford to hire servants and pack animals to take all his belongings from place to place. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: That which is stated with regard to Samuel is greater than that which is stated with regard to Moses, as with regard to Moses our teacher it is written: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">“I have not taken one donkey from them” </span>(Numbers 16:15), meaning that he did not take an item from another against his will <span class="gemarra-regular">even with payment. Whereas with regard to Samuel, even with </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">consen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> of the owner, <span class="gemarra-regular">he would not rent </span>an item from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “And they said: You have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ratzotanu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>neither have you taken anything from any man’s hand” (I Samuel 12:4), even with his consent [<span class="it-text">ratzon</span>].
<span class="gemarra-regular">Amos </span>was wealthy, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah: I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdsman, and a dresser of sycamore-trees” </span>(Amos 7:14). Amos is saying, <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yosef translates: Because I am the owner of flocks and I have sycamores in the lowland, </span>and I do not come to prophesy for financial gain. Apparently, Amos was wealthy.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Jonah </span>was wealthy, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: </span>“And he went down to Jaffa, and found a ship going to Tarshish, <span class="gemarra-regular">so he paid its cost and went down into it” </span>(Jonah 1:3), <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He paid the cost of the entire ship</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Romanus said: The cost for the </span>entire <span class="gemarra-regular">ship was four thousand gold dinars. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Initially, Moses would study Torah and forget it, until it was given to him as a gift, as it is stated: “And He gave it to Moses when he concluded speaking with him” </span>(Exodus 31:18). Once the Torah was given him as a gift, it became his and he was able to remember it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow, that other person <span class="gemarra-regular">may feed </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">wife and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">children</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">although </span>the one who is bound by the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">is obligated in their support </span>and benefits when another supports them. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he may not feed his animal, whether </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a kosher </span>animal or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-kosher </span>animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: He may feed the non-kosher </span>animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he may not feed the kosher </span>animal. The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between kosher and non-kosher </span>animals in this respect? Rabbi Eliezer <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: The kosher </span>animal’s <span class="gemarra-regular">being </span>belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to Heaven, and </span>the animal’s <span class="gemarra-regular">body is </span>the property of its owner, as he can eat it. Therefore, the owner benefits directly when another feeds his animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">And a non-kosher </span>animal, 

Daf 38b

both <span class="gemarra-regular">its being and its body </span>belong <span class="gemarra-regular">to Heaven</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is prohibited for its owner to eat its meat. The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: The non-kosher </span>animal <span class="gemarra-regular">too, its being</span> belongs <span class="gemarra-regular">to Heaven, and its body is </span>the property of its owner, because if the owner chooses, <span class="gemarra-regular">he sells i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to gentiles or feeds it to dogs.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yitzḥak bar Ḥananya said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow, he is permitted to marry his daughter to him. Rabbi Zeira discussed it: With what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">are we dealing? If we say </span>that it is a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the property of the father of the bride is forbidden to the groom, </span>this cannot be, as when one marries his daughter to the groom, <span class="gemarra-regular">he provides him a maidservant to serve him </span>and thereby benefits him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the property of the groom is forbidden to the father of the bride, </span>and although the groom supports the bride, her father is not considered to have benefited from the property of the groom. However, it cannot be this case either, as the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">stated </span>a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with a <span class="gemarra-regular">greater </span>novel element <span class="gemarra-regular">than that </span>in the mishna itself: And with regard to one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow, that other person <span class="gemarra-regular">may feed </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">wife and children, although </span>the one who is bound by the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">is obligated in their support. </span><span class="gemarra-regular">And you say that it is permitted to marry his daughter to him? </span>Isn’t that obvious? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the property of the father of the bride is forbidden to the groom, and where his daughter is a grown woman, and </span>where her father may marry her to another only <span class="gemarra-regular">with her consent. </span>Therefore, it is not from her father that the groom is deriving benefit. 
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">That is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. In the case of one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for that other person <span class="gemarra-regular">to marry his daughter to him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> However, he may marry </span>off <span class="gemarra-regular">his daughter, </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">a grown woman, to </span>that other person <span class="gemarra-regular">with her consent.</span>
Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ya’akov said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">one vows </span>that benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>him is forbidden to <span class="gemarra-regular">his son, </span>in order to induce him to engage in <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah study</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the one who took the vow may nevertheless perform actions that provide his son with minor benefit. It is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to fill a barrel of water for </span>his son <span class="gemarra-regular">and to kindle a lamp for him. Rabbi Yitzḥak said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to roast a small fish for him. Rabbi Yirmeya said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow it is permitted </span>for the other <span class="gemarra-regular">to give him a cup of peace to drink</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is this </span>cup of peace? <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>in Babylonia, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">interpreted </span>this term as referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a cup of </span>wine given to mourners to drink at the meal of comfort in <span class="gemarra-regular">the house of mourning</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">In the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that it is the <span class="gemarra-regular">cup of </span>wine that one drinks upon leaving <span class="gemarra-regular">the bathhouse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
§ We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And he may not feed </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">animal </span>of one for whom benefit from him is forbidden, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it is a kosher animal or whether it is a non-kosher animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Yehoshua of Uzza says: </span>One who vows that benefit from him is forbidden to another <span class="gemarra-regular">may feed </span>the other person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">Canaanite slaves and maidservants</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> however, he may not feed his animal, whether </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a non-kosher </span>animal or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">a kosher </span>animal. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>for the distinction? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">His Canaanite slaves and maidservant</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are designated for labor, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">an animal is designated for fattening. </span>The one bound by the vow derives benefit from the other person feeding the kosher animal when he eats it and derives benefit from the other person feeding the non-kosher animal when he sells it to a gentile. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow and he enters </span>his house <span class="gemarra-regular">to visit him, he stands </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">but does not sit. And </span>that other person <span class="gemarra-regular">heals him </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a cure </span>of the <span class="gemarra-italic">nefesh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but not a cure of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mamon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>

Daf 39a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing? If </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the property of the visitor is forbidden to the ill person, even </span>if he is <span class="gemarra-regular">sitting, </span>this should <span class="gemarra-regular">also </span>be permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the property of the ill person is forbidden to the visitor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even </span>if he is <span class="gemarra-regular">standing, </span>it should <span class="gemarra-regular">also not </span>be permitted, as one derives benefit from entering the house. <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: Actually, </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the property of the visitor is forbidden to the ill person</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in a place where one takes payment for </span>visiting and <span class="gemarra-regular">sitting </span>with an ill person <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one does not take payment for </span>visiting and <span class="gemarra-regular">standing </span>with an ill person. Therefore, by sitting with the ill person the visitor provides him forbidden benefit by sparing him the expense of hiring another person to sit with him. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>was this distinction stated <span class="gemarra-regular">without qualification? </span>There is no apparent fundamental difference between sitting and standing when visiting the ill. The Gemara answers: It <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us this: Even in a place where one takes payment </span>for visiting the ill, <span class="gemarra-regular">for sitting,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one ought to take </span>payment, but <span class="gemarra-regular">for standing, one ought not to take </span>payment. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you wish, say </span>instead that the distinction can be explained <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim</span> said elsewhere (42a), that one who is prohibited to derive benefit from another due to a rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>may not enter a field that is owned by the latter, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest he remain standing </span>there longer than permitted. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too,</span> sitting is prohibited due to a rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree, lest he remain sitting </span>there longer than is necessary to perform the mitzva of visiting the ill.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said: Actually, </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the property of the ill person is forbidden to the visitor, and where </span>the ill person <span class="gemarra-regular">did not vow </span>that his property would be forbidden in cases where its use enables the visitor to meet needs pertaining to <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>continued <span class="gemarra-regular">existence. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">even sitting </span>should be permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">as well, </span>since the vow did not prohibit use pertaining to his existential needs. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it possible </span>to meet those needs and visit the ill <span class="gemarra-regular">while standing? </span>Therefore, sitting is not an existential need.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he became ill, he enters to visit him; if his son became ill, he inquires </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>son’s health <span class="gemarra-regular">in the marketplace </span>but may not enter the house to visit him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to Ulla, who </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the property of the ill person is forbidden to the visitor and where </span>the ill person <span class="gemarra-regular">did not vow </span>that the property be forbidden in cases pertaining to his continued <span class="gemarra-regular">existence, </span>this works out <span class="gemarra-regular">well, </span>as he excluded his own existential needs from the vow, not his son’s existential needs.
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to Shmuel, who said: </span>It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the property of the visitor is forbidden to the ill person, what is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">him and what is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">his son? </span>Why is it prohibited for him to visit when the son is ill? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel </span>could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: The mishna </span>is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the property of the visitor is forbidden to the ill person; the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the property of the ill person is forbidden to the visitor. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>was this distinction between the mishna and the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> stated <span class="gemarra-regular">without qualification? Rava said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel, </span>

Daf 39b

<span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna was difficult for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Why does </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically teach: </span>He <span class="gemarra-regular">stands </span>in his house but <span class="gemarra-regular">may not sit? Conclude from it that the property of the visitor is forbidden to the ill person.</span>
§ Apropos the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of visiting the ill, the Gemara cites related statements. <span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: From where </span>is there <span class="gemarra-regular">an allusion from the Torah to visiting the ill? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “If these men die the common death of all men, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>be visited after <span class="gemarra-regular">the visitation of all men, </span>then the Lord has not sent me” (Numbers 16:29). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where </span>in this verse <span class="gemarra-regular">may </span>visiting the ill <span class="gemarra-regular">be inferred? Rava said </span>that this is what Moses is saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">If these men, </span>the congregation of Korah, <span class="gemarra-regular">die the common death of all men, who become ill, and are confined to their beds, and people come to visit them; </span>if that happens to them, <span class="gemarra-regular">what do the people say? </span>They say: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Lord has not sent me for this </span>task.
Apropos Korah and his congregation, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava interpreted </span>the repetitive formulation in this verse <span class="gemarra-regular">homiletically: “But if the Lord will create a creation [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beria</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">yivra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>and the ground opens its mouth, and swallows them, and all that is theirs, and they will descend alive into the pit, then you shall understand that these men have despised God” (Numbers 16:30). Here, Moses is saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">If Gehenna </span>is already <span class="gemarra-regular">a creation [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">beria</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>and exists, <span class="gemarra-regular">that is optimal; if not, God should create </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yivra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>it now.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so? </span>Was there uncertainty at that point as to whether Gehenna had already been created? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Seven phenomena were created before the world was created</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and they are: Torah, and repentance, the Garden of Eden, and Gehenna, the Throne of Glory, and the Temple, and the name of the Messiah. </span>
The Gemara provides sources for each of these phenomena. <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah </span>was created before the world was created, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “The Lord made me as the beginning of His way, </span>the first of His works of old” (Proverbs 8:22). Based on the subsequent verses, this is referring to the Torah.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Repentance </span>was created before the world was created, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “Before the mountains were brought forth, </span>or ever You had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God” (Psalms 90:2), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written </span>immediately afterward: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You return man to contrition; </span>and You say: Repent, children of man” (Psalms 90:3). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Garden of Eden </span>was created before the world was created, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden eastward [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mikedem</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Genesis 2:8). “Eastward [<span class="it-text">mikedem</span>]” is interpreted in the sense of before [<span class="it-text">mikodem</span>], i.e., before the world was created. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Gehenna </span>was created before the world was created, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “For its hearth is ordained of old” </span>(Isaiah 30:33). The hearth, i.e., Gehenna, was created before the world was created. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Throne of Glory </span>was created before the world was created, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “Your throne is established of old, </span>You are from everlasting” (Psalms 93:2).
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Temple </span>was created before the world was created, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “Your Throne of Glory on high from the beginning, </span>in the place of our Temple” (Jeremiah 17:12). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The name of the Messiah </span>was created before the world was created, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written </span>about him: <span class="gemarra-regular">“May his name endure forever; </span>his name existed before the sun” (Psalms 72:17). The name of the Messiah predated the creation of the sun and the rest of the world. Apparently, Rava’s explanation that Moses was uncertain whether Gehenna had been created yet is contradicted by this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the interpretation of the repetitive formulation of the verse is that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>Moses <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying: If the opening was created for </span>Gehenna, that is <span class="gemarra-regular">optimal, and if not, the Lord should create </span>it now. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it written: </span>“And <span class="gemarra-regular">there is nothing new under the sun” </span>(Ecclesiastes 1:9)? How, then, could Moses request that God create the mouth of Gehenna now? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what </span>Moses <span class="gemarra-regular">said: If the mouth </span>of Gehenna <span class="gemarra-regular">is not close to here, let </span>God <span class="gemarra-regular">bring it closer.</span>
Apropos the conflict between Moses and Korah, the Gemara cites an additional verse that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava interpreted homiletically, and some say that </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “The sun and moon stood still in their habitation [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zevula</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> at the light of Your arrows as they go, at the shining of Your glittering spear” (Habakkuk 3:11)? <span class="gemarra-regular">What do the sun and moon seek in </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zevul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which is the fourth heaven; <span class="gemarra-regular">aren’t they fixed in </span><span class="gemarra-italic">rakia</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>the second heaven? Rather, this <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that the sun and moon ascended from </span><span class="gemarra-italic">rakia</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">zevul</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and said before Him: Master of the Universe! If You do justice for the son of Amram, </span>i.e., Moses, in his dispute with Korah, <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>will continue to <span class="gemarra-regular">illuminate </span>the world, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if not, we </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">not illuminate </span>the world. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">At that moment, </span>the Holy One, Blessed be He, <span class="gemarra-regular">shot arrows, and </span>threw <span class="gemarra-regular">spears at them, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Each and every day </span>idolaters <span class="gemarra-regular">bow to you and you </span>continue to <span class="gemarra-regular">illuminate </span>the world and do not protest. <span class="gemarra-regular">In My honor, you did not protest, but in honor of flesh and blood, you protested? And </span>ever since, <span class="gemarra-regular">each and every day </span>the heavenly hosts <span class="gemarra-regular">shoot arrows and </span>throw <span class="gemarra-regular">spears at </span>the sun and the moon, and only then do they emerge and <span class="gemarra-regular">illuminate </span>the world, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “At the light of Your arrows as they go, at the shining of Your glittering spear” </span>(Habakkuk 3:11).
§ Returning to the topic of visiting the ill, the Gemara states: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The mitzva of <span class="gemarra-regular">visiting the ill </span><span class="gemarra-regular">has no </span>fixed <span class="gemarra-regular">measure. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">Has no </span>fixed <span class="gemarra-regular">measure? Rav Yosef thought to say: There is no </span>fixed <span class="gemarra-regular">measure for the granting of its reward. Abaye said to him: And do all </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">mitzvot have </span>a fixed <span class="gemarra-regular">measure for the granting of their reward? But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Avot</span> 2:1): <span class="gemarra-regular">Be </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">meticulous in </span>the observance of <span class="gemarra-regular">a minor mitzva as a major one, as you do not know the granting of reward for mitzvot. Rather, Abaye said: </span>There is no fixed measure for the disparity between the ill person and his visitor, as <span class="gemarra-regular">even a prominent </span>person pays a visit <span class="gemarra-regular">to a lowly </span>person and should not say that doing so is beneath a person of his standing. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>There is no fixed measure for the number of times that one should visit the ill, as <span class="gemarra-regular">even one hundred times a day </span>is appropriate.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Ḥanina said: Anyone who visits an ill person takes </span>from him <span class="gemarra-regular">one-sixtieth of his suffering. </span>The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If so, let sixty </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">enter </span>to visit him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and stand him up, </span>and restore him to health. Rav Aḥa bar Ḥanina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">like the tenths of the school of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, who said that each of one’s daughters inherits one-tenth of his possessions. His intent was that each daughter would receive one-tenth of the remainder after the previous daughter took her portion. Here too, each visitor takes from the ill person one-sixtieth of the suffering that remains, and consequently a degree of suffering will always remain with the ill person. <span class="gemarra-regular">Furthermore, </span>visiting is effective in easing the suffering of the ill person only when the visitor is <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>born under the <span class="gemarra-regular">same constellatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> as the ill person. 
The Gemara elaborates on the tenths of the school of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">says: A daughter who is supported from the property of </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">brothers </span>after the death of their father <span class="gemarra-regular">receives one-tenth </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">estate </span>as her dowry. The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to your statement, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who has ten daughters and a son, no </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">at all </span>remains <span class="gemarra-regular">for the son in a place </span>where there are <span class="gemarra-regular">daughters, </span>as they receive the entire inheritance. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: The first </span>daughter <span class="gemarra-regular">takes one-tenth of the estate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the second </span>takes one-tenth <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the first <span class="gemarra-regular">left </span>of the inheritance, <span class="gemarra-regular">the third </span>takes one-tenth <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the second <span class="gemarra-regular">left </span>of the inheritance, and so on. After each succeeding daughter takes her share, they pool their resources and <span class="gemarra-regular">then divide </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">equally. </span>Therefore, the son is left with a share of the inheritance.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥelb</span><span class="gemarra-regular">o</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fell ill. Rav Kahana went out and announced: </span>

Daf 40a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥelbo fell ill. There was no one who came </span>to visit him. Rav Kahana <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t the incident involving one of the students of Rabbi Akiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who became sick </span>transpire <span class="gemarra-regular">in that manner? </span>In that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages did not enter to visit him, and Rabbi Akiva entered to visit him </span>and instructed his students to care for him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And since they swept and sprinkled water on the </span>dirt <span class="gemarra-regular">floor before </span>the sick student, <span class="gemarra-regular">he recovered. </span>The student <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Akiva: <span class="gemarra-regular">My teacher, you revived me. Rabbi Akiva went out and taught: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who does not visit the ill, it is as though he is spilling blood, </span>as it could be that the sick person has no one to care for him. If there are no visitors, no one will know his situation and therefore no one will come to his aid.
<span class="gemarra-regular">When Rav Dimi came from Eretz Yisrael </span>to Babylonia <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: Anyone who visits the ill </span><span class="gemarra-regular">causes that he will live, and anyone who does not visit the il</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> causes that he will die. </span>The Gemara asks: In <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way are his actions <span class="gemarra-regular">the cause </span>of that result? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who visits the ill pleads for mercy</span> from God <span class="gemarra-regular">that he will live, and anyone who does not visit the ill pleads for mercy that he will die, does it enter your mind </span>that he would pray <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the sick person <span class="gemarra-regular">will die? Rather, anyone who does not visit the ill</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> does not plead for mercy for him, neither that he will live nor that he will die</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since he might have saved the sick person with prayers had he visited, his failure to visit is tantamount to causing his death.
The Gemara relates with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava: </span>On <span class="gemarra-regular">the first day that he was ill, he </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say to </span>his family: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not reveal to any perso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> that I am ill, so <span class="gemarra-regular">that his luck not suffer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> From</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">forward, </span>when his situation deteriorated <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say to them: Go and proclaim in the marketplace </span>that I am ill, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">let all who hate me rejoice over my </span>distress, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is written: “Rejoice not when your enemy falls, and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles; lest the Lord see it, and it displease Him, and He turn away His wrath from him” </span>(Proverbs 24:17–18). <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">who love me pray </span>that God have <span class="gemarra-regular">mercy upon me.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: Anyone who visits the ill is spared from the judgment of Gehenna, as it is stated: “Happy is he that considers the poor; the Lord will deliver him in the day of evil” </span>(Psalms 41:2). In this verse, the term <span class="gemarra-regular">poor [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">nothing other </span>than <span class="gemarra-regular">ill, as it is stated </span>in the prayer of Hezekiah when he was ill: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He will cut me off from the illness [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">middalla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Isaiah 38:12). <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>it may be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from this verse </span>in which Jonadab asked his sick friend Amnon, son of King David: “<span class="gemarra-regular">Why, son of the king, are you so sick [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] from morning to morning?” </span>(II Samuel 13:4). <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">evil means nothing other </span>than <span class="gemarra-regular">Gehenna, as it is stated: “The Lord made everything for His own purpose, and even the wicked for the day of evil” </span>(Proverbs 16:4), and the ultimate punishment of the evildoer is Gehenna. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if one visited </span>the ill, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is his reward? </span>The Gemara wonders at that question: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is his reward? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>He <span class="gemarra-regular">is spared from the judgment of Gehenna. Rather, </span>the question is: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is his reward in this world? </span>
Rav continues: His reward is as it is written: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive, let him be called happy in the land; and deliver not You him unto the greed of his enemies” </span>(Psalms 41:3). He elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">“The Lord will preserve him” from the evil inclination; “and keep him alive” </span>and spare him <span class="gemarra-regular">from suffering; “let him be called happy in the land” </span>means that <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone will be honored </span>from their association <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">him; “and deliver not You him unto the greed of his enemies,” </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">that companions like </span>those who counseled <span class="gemarra-regular">Naaman </span>to seek <span class="gemarra-regular">a cure for his leprosy </span>from Elisha (II Kings 5:3) <span class="gemarra-regular">will happen to </span>associate with <span class="gemarra-regular">him, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">companions like </span>those who counseled <span class="gemarra-regular">Rehoboam </span>with advice that resulted in <span class="gemarra-regular">the schism in his kingdom </span>(I Kings 12:6–19) <span class="gemarra-regular">will not happen to </span>associate with <span class="gemarra-regular">him. </span>
On a similar note, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">If youths would say to you: Construct, and Elders would say to you: Demolish, heed the Elders and do not heed the youths, as the construction of youths is demolition, and the demolition of Elders is construction. And a mnemonic </span>device <span class="gemarra-regular">for this matter </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">“Rehoboam, son of Solomon” </span>(I Kings 12:21). Had he heeded the advice of the Elders and yielded at that time, there would have been no schism.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said: Let one not visit a sick person, neither during the first three hours </span>of the day, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor in the last three hours of the day, so that he will not be diverted from </span>praying for <span class="gemarra-regular">mercy. </span>Rav Sheisha elaborates: During <span class="gemarra-regular">the first three hours </span>the sick person <span class="gemarra-regular">is relieved, </span>as after a night’s sleep his suffering is somewhat alleviated and the visitor will conclude that there is no need for prayer. In <span class="gemarra-regular">the last </span>three hours of the day <span class="gemarra-regular">his weakness is exacerbated, </span>and the visitor will despair of ameliorating his suffering and will conclude that prayer is futile.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravin said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Holy One, Blessed be He </span>Himself <span class="gemarra-regular">sustains the sick person? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “The Lord will support him upon the bed of suffering” </span>(Psalms 41:4). Support in this context is understood to mean that He will feed him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Ravin said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: From where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Divine Presence is resting above the bed of the sick person? </span>It is also <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “The Lord will support him upon the bed of suffering,” </span>which indicates that God is actually over his bed. 
The Gemara notes that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who enters to visit a sick person may neither sit on the bed nor </span>sit <span class="gemarra-regular">on a bench or on a chai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> that is higher than the bed upon which the sick person is lying. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, he </span>deferentially <span class="gemarra-regular">wraps himself </span>in his garment <span class="gemarra-regular">and sits on the ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because the Divine Presence is resting above the bed of the sick person, as it is stated: “The Lord will support him upon the bed of suffering,” </span>and it is inappropriate for one to sit above the place where the Divine Presence rests.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>apropos statements of Rav cited by Ravin, the Gemara cites an additional statement that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravin said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: When </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">rain in the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">a great witness to </span>that rainfall <span class="gemarra-regular">is the Euphrates River, </span>as ultimately that rainwater increases the water flow in the Euphrates River. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this statement of Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">disagrees </span>with a statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel, as Shmuel said: A river is blessed from its banks</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the increase in its water flow is attributable to its tributaries and not to rain. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel disagrees with </span>another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel, as Shmuel said: The water purifies when flowin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> 

Daf 40b

<span class="gemarra-regular">in the Euphrates </span>River <span class="gemarra-regular">only during the days of Tishre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> alone, </span>as after the summer, when no rain falls, it is clear that the water in the river flows from the source of the river. During the rest of the year, rain and snow are mingled with the river water, and water from rain and snow purify one who immerses in them only when the water is standing.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel’s fathe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> fashioned ritual baths for his daughters during the days of Nisa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>placed <span class="gemarra-regular">mat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> in the Euphrates River <span class="gemarra-regular">during the days of Tishrei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> He fashioned ritual baths during Nisan due to the concern that the rainwater and snow water that accumulated in the river exceeded the amount of water that originated in the river’s sources. Since immersion in the flowing water would be ineffective, he fashioned ritual baths of standing water elsewhere for them. He placed mats during the days of Tishrei, when they immersed in the river itself, to prevent the mud on the riverbed from acting as an interposition that would invalidate the immersion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “And you, son of man, make for yourself implements of exile” </span>(Ezekiel 12:3)? <span class="gemarra-regular">That is</span> referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">a lamp, and a bowl, </span>

Daf 41a

<span class="gemarra-regular">and a rug, </span>as an exile needs those items and they are portable. The Sages interpreted the following verse describing the exile experience: “Therefore shall you serve your enemy whom the Lord shall send against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and <span class="gemarra-regular">in want of all things</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> and he shall put a yoke of iron upon your neck, until he has destroyed you” (Deuteronomy 28:48). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>“In want of all things” means <span class="gemarra-regular">without a lamp and without a table </span>to eat upon. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: Without a wife. Rav Sheshet said: Without an attendant </span>to aid him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: Without intelligence. </span>One of the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Without salt and without fat [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">revav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> in which to dip his bread.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">we have a tradition: A poor person is only </span>one lacking <span class="gemarra-regular">in intelligence, </span>in agreement with the opinion of Rav Naḥman. <span class="gemarra-regular">In the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">they say: </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>attribute, intelligence, <span class="gemarra-regular">in him </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">everything in him. </span>One <span class="gemarra-regular">who does not </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>attribute <span class="gemarra-regular">in him, what is in him? </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he acquired this, what </span>else <span class="gemarra-regular">is lacking? </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not acquired this, what has he acquired</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Alexandri said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: The sick person recovers from his illness only when </span>the heavenly court <span class="gemarra-regular">forgives him</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for all his sins</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: “Who forgives all your iniquity; Who heals all your diseases” </span>(Psalms 103:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna said: </span>When he recovers, <span class="gemarra-regular">he returns to the days of his youth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated </span>in a verse with regard to one recovering from illness: <span class="gemarra-regular">“His flesh is tenderer than a child’s; he returns to the days of his youth” </span>(Job 33:25). Interpreting the verse: “The Lord will support him upon the bed of suffering; <span class="gemarra-regular">You overturned all his lying down in his illness” </span>(Psalms 41:4), <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>That is <span class="gemarra-regular">to say that </span>the sick person <span class="gemarra-regular">forgets his studies</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as everything that is organized is overturned.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yose</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span> himself <span class="gemarra-regular">fell ill </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">his studies were forgotten. Abay</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> restored </span>his studies by reviewing what he had learned from Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">before him. This is </span>the background for that <span class="gemarra-regular">which we say everywhere </span>throughout the Talmud, that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: I did not learn this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">You said this to us and </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">you said it to us.</span>
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">would learn thirteen aspects of a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> on a certain issue, <span class="gemarra-regular">he taught Rabbi Ḥiyy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> seven of them.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ultimately, Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">fell ill </span>and forgot all thirteen aspects. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya restored those seven aspects that </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">taught him </span>by reviewing them before Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">six were gone </span>and forgotten, as Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi had not taught them to anyone. There <span class="gemarra-regular">was a certain launderer </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">would hear Rabbi</span> Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">when he was studying </span>those <span class="it-text">halakhot</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya went and learned </span>those <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from the launderer and he came and restored them </span>by reviewing them <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">saw that launderer, Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You made me and Ḥiyya, </span>as we were able to learn these <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> that otherwise would have been forgotten. <span class="gemarra-regular">Some say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what he said to </span>the launderer: <span class="gemarra-regular">You made Ḥiyya, and Ḥiyya made me.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Alexandri said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: Greater is the miracle performed for the sick person than the miracle that was performed for Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</span> who were rescued from the fiery furnace (see Daniel, chapter 3), as in the miracle of <span class="gemarra-regular">Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, </span>they were rescued from <span class="gemarra-regular">the fire of a layman, and anyone is capable of extinguishing it. And that </span>fire afflicting <span class="gemarra-regular">a sick person </span>with a fever is the fire <span class="gemarra-regular">of Heaven, and who can extinguish it? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Alexandri said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said, and some say Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Once the end </span>of the time allotted for the life of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person arrived, everything has dominion over him, as it is stated </span>that Cain said: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Whosoever finds me will slay me” </span>(Genesis 4:14). Cain feared that since God sentenced him to death he would be susceptible to all threats and vulnerable to anyone seeking to murder him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said </span>that it is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from this verse: “They stand this day according to Your judgments; for all are Your servants” </span>(Psalms 119:91). When the decree emerges from Heaven that the time has arrived for a person to die, everyone is a servant of God, an agent to kill him. 
The Gemara relates that people <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rabba bar Sheila: A man died. </span>This person <span class="gemarra-regular">was tall </span>and was <span class="gemarra-regular">riding on a small mule [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">giredona</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> When he reached a bridge [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tittora</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the mule <span class="gemarra-regular">was frightened [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">istavveit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">cast off </span>the rider, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>although the rider was tall and the mule was short and the rider did not fall far, <span class="gemarra-regular">he died. </span>Rabba bar Sheila <span class="gemarra-regular">read </span>the verse and applied it <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the rider: <span class="gemarra-regular">“They stand this day according to Your judgments.”</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel saw a certain frog [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kerokita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and also noticed <span class="gemarra-regular">that a scorpion was sitting upon the frog and </span>the frog <span class="gemarra-regular">crossed the river. </span>The scorpion <span class="gemarra-regular">stung a man </span>on the other side of the river <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the man <span class="gemarra-regular">died. </span>Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">read </span>and applied the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the dead man: <span class="gemarra-regular">“They stand this day according to Your judgments.” </span>Even the frog and scorpion are servants and agents of God. The only way the scorpion could reach the man and kill him was by means of the frog taking it across the river.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: One visits a sick person only if </span>that person <span class="gemarra-regular">is one whom fever overcame. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>illnesses <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span>this statement come to <span class="gemarra-regular">exclude? </span>The Gemara answers: It comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei ben Perata says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: One visits neither those with intestinal illness, nor </span><span class="gemarra-regular">those with eye illness, nor </span>those suffering from <span class="gemarra-regular">headaches</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>one does not visit <span class="gemarra-regular">those with intestinal sickness, due to </span>the sick person’s <span class="gemarra-regular">embarrassment, </span>as he would need to frequently relieve himself and it would be awkward for him in the presence of the visitor. <span class="gemarra-regular">However,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is the reason </span>that one does not visit <span class="gemarra-regular">those with eye illnesses and headaches? </span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is due to </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rav Yehuda said, as Rav Yehuda said: Speech is injurious for the ey</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and beneficial for </span>curing <span class="gemarra-regular">a fever</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, if one suffers from pain in his eye or his head it is better for him not to talk. If he has visitors, he will need to speak to them, which will cause him harm. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this fever [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ishta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> were it not the agent </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">parvanka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the Angel of Death, </span>i.e., the cause of serious, potentially deadly illnesses, it could be deemed <span class="gemarra-regular">beneficial, </span>

Daf 41b

<span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>thorns <span class="gemarra-regular">for palm trees, </span>as the thorns prevent people and animals from touching and ruining the dates. The fever is advantageous if its incidence is <span class="gemarra-regular">once in thirty days, and it is like an antidote [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tiraiki</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span>poison in <span class="gemarra-regular">the body. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>It is preferable for one to have <span class="gemarra-regular">neither </span>fever <span class="gemarra-regular">nor </span>the benefits of <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>capacity to serve as an <span class="gemarra-regular">antidote</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Yonatan said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yeḥiel said: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Arsan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is beneficial for the sick person for his cure. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">arsan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? Rabbi Yonatan said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">old hulled barley from the beginning of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sifting </span>process. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: And </span>that barley <span class="gemarra-regular">requires </span>extensive <span class="gemarra-regular">cooking like the meat of a bull</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yosef said: </span><span class="it-text">Arsan</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is fine flour [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">semida</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> ground <span class="gemarra-regular">from old barley from the beginning of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sifting </span>process. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: And </span>that flour <span class="gemarra-regular">requires </span>extensive <span class="gemarra-regular">cooking like the meat of a bull. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One does not visit </span>a person suffering from <span class="gemarra-italic">buredam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> an intestinal illness, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor is the name </span>of that illness <span class="gemarra-regular">mentioned</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> because it is embarrassing for the one suffering from the illness. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that one does not visit him? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar said: </span>It is due to the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that he is like a flowing spring, </span>as the symptom of the illness is severe diarrhea. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Elazar said: Why is </span>the illness <span class="gemarra-regular">called </span><span class="gemarra-italic">buredam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>It is due to the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the one suffering from the illness <span class="gemarra-regular">is like a flowing spring, </span>a bottomless pit [<span class="it-text">bor</span>] of blood [<span class="it-text">dam</span>].
§ We learned in the mishna that if one is prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit from another, that other person <span class="gemarra-regular">heals him </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">a cure of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">nefes</span><span class="gemarra-italic">h</span> but not a cure of property [<span class="it-text">mamon</span>]. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">How is </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">taught? If we say that cure of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">nefesh</span> means that he cures him <span class="gemarra-regular">for free and cure of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mamon</span> means that he cures him <span class="gemarra-regular">for a fee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach this: He cures him for free but not for a fee. Rather, cure of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">nefesh</span> means that he cures <span class="gemarra-regular">his body, and cure of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">mamon</span> means that he cures <span class="gemarra-regular">his animal. Rabbi Zutra bar Toviya said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>It is prohibited to cure the animal. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, he says to him: Such and such medicine is beneficial </span>for the animal, <span class="gemarra-regular">and such and such medicine is harmful </span>for the animal. Advice, as opposed to treatment, is not considered benefit.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to another person who is prohibited from deriving benefit from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">one may bathe with him in a large bath [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ambati</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in which his presence does not affect the other person. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>he may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>bathe with him <span class="gemarra-regular">in a small </span>bath, as his presence moderates the temperature of water if it is too hot or too cold, thereby benefiting the other person. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he may sleep with him in </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">bed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>That is permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">during the days of summer, but </span>he may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>sleep with him in one bed <span class="gemarra-regular">during the rainy season, </span>i.e., the winter, <span class="gemarra-regular">because he benefits him </span>by warming the bed. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he may recline with him on a divan </span>even during the rainy season, as no benefit is involved. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he may eat with him at </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">table, but not from </span>a common <span class="gemarra-regular">platte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> from which several people eat, as if one leaves food on the platter, the other derives benefit from him. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, he may eat with him from a platter that returns </span>to the host, as everyone takes a small portion and leaves food on the platter. No benefit is derived. Since there is enough food for everyone, none of the diners receives part of another’s portion.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may neither </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bathe with him in a bath nor sleep with him in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">bed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and there is no difference <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it is a <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>bed or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it is a <span class="gemarra-regular">small </span>bed; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for him to sleep with him in a <span class="gemarra-regular">large </span>bed <span class="gemarra-regular">during the rainy season and a small </span>bed <span class="gemarra-regular">during the days of summer, </span>as no benefit is derived. <span class="gemarra-regular">He may bathe with him in a large bath</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and sweat with him in a small </span><span class="gemarra-regular">one</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as his presence provides no benefit for the other.

Daf 42a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one for whom benefit from another is forbidden, before, </span>i.e., a year other than <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sabbatical Year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he may neither ente</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the field </span>of that other person, <span class="gemarra-regular">nor eat from </span>the produce that leans out of the field, even if he does not enter the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">And during the Sabbatical Year, </span>when the produce of the trees is ownerless, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not enter his field</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> however, he may eat from the growths that lean </span>out of the field, as the produce does not belong to the other person. If <span class="gemarra-regular">one vowed before the Sabbatical Year </span>that benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>another’s <span class="gemarra-regular">food </span>is forbidden for him, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may enter his field; however, he may not eat of the produce. And during the Sabbatical Year, he may enter </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">and may eat </span>the produce.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel who both say </span>that if one vowed <span class="gemarra-regular">before the Sabbatical Year: </span>Benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">this property </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to you,</span> the other <span class="gemarra-regular">may neither enter his field, nor eat from </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">that leans </span>out of the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though the Sabbatical Year arrived </span>in the interim, because the prohibition of the produce took effect before the Sabbatical Year and remained in effect after the Sabbatical Year began. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he vowed during the Sabbatical Year, he may not enter a field </span>that is included in that property; <span class="gemarra-regular">however,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he may eat from </span>the produce that leans out of the field, because the produce was ownerless when he vowed. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who both say </span>that if one vowed <span class="gemarra-regular">before the Sabbatical Year: </span>Benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">my property </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to you, </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">may neither enter his field nor eat from </span>the produce that leans out of the field. When <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sabbatical Year arrives, he may not enter his field; however, he may eat from </span>the produce that leans out of the field, because the produce is ownerless.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that they disagree about this, that Rav and Shmuel hold: A person </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">render an ite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in his possession forbidden, </span>and the prohibition remains in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">even when it leaves his possession. </span>Since he rendered the produce forbidden before the Sabbatical Year, the prohibition remains in effect after the produce becomes ownerless during the Sabbatical Year. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish hold: A person cannot render an item in his possession forbidden</span> and have the prohibition remain in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">when it leaves his possession. </span>Therefore, it is permitted to eat the produce during the Sabbatical Year.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>how can <span class="gemarra-regular">you understand </span>it in that manner? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is there anyone who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person cannot render an item in his possession forbidden </span>and have the prohibition remain in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">when it leaves his possession? If so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>if Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish hold that one cannot do so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let them disagree in </span>the case of one who said: Benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">this property </span>is forbidden to you, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that would be true <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>if he said: Benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">my property </span>is forbidden to you. In the latter case, it is clear that the prohibition remains in effect only as long as the item remains in his possession.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Kamma</span> 108b) <span class="gemarra-regular">that a person </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">render an item in his possession forbidden</span> and the prohibition remains in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">when it leaves his possession? </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna, that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to his son: Benefit from my </span>property is <span class="gemarra-italic">kona</span><span class="gemarra-italic">m</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for you, </span>if the father <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, </span>the son <span class="gemarra-regular">will inherit</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> him. </span>He is not deriving benefit from his father’s property, as after death it is no longer his. If the father vowed to render benefit from his property forbidden to his son <span class="gemarra-regular">during his lifetime and upon his death, </span>

Daf 42b

then <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, </span>his son <span class="gemarra-regular">does not inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Apparently, one can render his property forbidden and have it remain forbidden after it is no longer in his possession. The Gemara rejects that proof: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is different here, as he said to him </span>explicitly: <span class="gemarra-regular">During his lifetime and upon his death. </span>There is no proof that in a case where he did not explicitly extend the prohibition to the period after it leaves his possession, the prohibition would not remain in effect. 
The second question was answered, but <span class="gemarra-regular">in any case </span>the first question remains <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> Why didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish disagree in a case where he said: This property, as well? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this is the explanation of their dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">In </span>the case of one who said: Benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">this property </span>is forbidden to you, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone agrees </span>that the prohibition remains in effect even after the item is no longer in his possession. <span class="gemarra-regular">When they disagree, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of one who said: Benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">my propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> is forbidden to you. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel hold: </span>It <span class="gemarra-regular">is no different </span>if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This property, </span>and it <span class="gemarra-regular">is no different</span> if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">My property; </span>in both cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">a person renders </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>and the prohibition remains in effect even after the item is no longer in his possession. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish hold: </span>If one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Property, a person renders </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>and the prohibition remains in effect. However, if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">My property, a person does not render </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>for the period after it is no longer in his possession, as the phrase my property means property in my possession.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And is there anyone who says </span>that it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">no different </span>if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This property, and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is no different </span>if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">My property, </span>and that the prohibition remains in effect even after the item is no longer in his possession? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (46a): <span class="gemarra-regular">If one says to another: Entering into your house is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Buying your field is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me,</span> then if the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">died or sold </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">to another, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for the one who vowed to enter the house or buy the field, as the prohibition is in effect only as long as it belongs to that person. However, if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Entering this house </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Buying this field </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me,</span> then if the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">died or sold </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">to another, </span>it remains <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden. </span>Apparently, there is a difference between a case where he simply renders an item forbidden and a case where he renders an item belonging to a particular individual forbidden. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>this is the explanation of the statements of the <span class="it-text">amora’im</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish sai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that the prohibition is no longer in effect after the item is no longer in his possession, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">My property. And </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav and Shmuel </span>said that the prohibition remains in effect after the item is no longer in his possession, it was <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case where he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">This property. And they do not disagree, </span>as each pair of <span class="it-text">amora’im</span> addressed a different situation.
We learned in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And during the Sabbatical Year he may not enter his field; </span>however, he eats from the produce that leans out of the field. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about the Sabbatical Year <span class="gemarra-regular">that he </span>is permitted to <span class="gemarra-regular">eat of </span>the produce that leans out of the field? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the produce </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is ownerless. </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">land as well, </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">rendered it ownerless, </span>as during the Sabbatical Year, it is permitted for everyone to enter the field and eat the produce. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said: </span>The mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">trees are standing on the borders </span>of the field. Since it is possible to eat the produce without entering the field, it is not permitted for him to enter it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim said: </span>Even in a case where the fruit trees are standing in the middle of the field, it is also prohibited for him to enter the field, due to a rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree lest he remain standin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> there longer than necessary for purposes of eating, which is prohibited even during the Sabbatical Year.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow, </span>that other person <span class="gemarra-regular">may neither lend </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">nor borrow </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">from him. </span>Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may neither lend </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">to him nor borrow </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">from him. And he may neither sell</span> an item <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">nor purchase </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">from him. </span>

However, </span>with regard to the fact that the former <span class="gemarra-regular">may not borrow </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the latter, in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">does he benefit him </span>by borrowing his money? <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it could even be said, <span class="gemarra-regular">granted </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he may neither borrow </span>money <span class="gemarra-regular">from him nor purchase </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">from him, as one benefits </span>in lending money by preserving the value of that money in case the coins deteriorate, and in selling by ridding oneself an item that is difficult to sell. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to the fact that the person from whom benefit is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">may not borrow </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the person for whom benefit is forbidden, in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way <span class="gemarra-regular">does </span>the lender <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from him? </span>The borrower returns the same item to the lender.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: </span>The mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where they </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">vowed </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from each other</span> is forbidden. Clearly, then, neither of them may lend to the other or borrow from him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>It is possible to explain the mishna as it is written, as referring to a case where only one vowed that benefit from the other is forbidden. However, the Sages issued <span class="gemarra-regular">a decree </span>that it is also prohibited for one <span class="gemarra-regular">to borro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> from a person for whom benefit from him is forbidden, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the concern that he might come <span class="gemarra-regular">to lend </span>to him, as reciprocity is common in these matters. <span class="gemarra-regular">And likewise, </span>that is the explanation <span class="gemarra-regular">in all </span>the cases in the mishna; it is prohibited to borrow money, borrow items, and to purchase items from him due to a rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree, </span>lest he come to benefit him.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One said to </span>another: <span class="gemarra-regular">Lend me your cow. </span>The other person <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>My cow <span class="gemarra-regular">is not available. </span>The one seeking to borrow the cow responded angrily: <span class="gemarra-regular">Plowing my field with </span>this cow <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">forever</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">If it was his </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner to plow </span>the field himself, then it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>to plow his field with that cow <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">person.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If it is not his </span>typical <span class="gemarra-regular">manner to plow </span>the field himself, and he has others plow for him, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">him and </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">every </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">person </span>to plow his field with that cow, because his intent was to render benefit from plowing with this cow forbidden. 
In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow and</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have anything to eat, </span>the one from whom benefit is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">goes to the shopkeeper</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> to him: <span class="gemarra-regular">So-and-so vowed that benefit from me is forbidden </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">and I do not know what I will do. </span>After grasping his intent, the shopkeeper <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the one for whom benefit is forbidden, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then the shopkeeper <span class="gemarra-regular">comes and takes </span>payment for the food <span class="gemarra-regular">from that </span>one who spoke to him.
Similarly, if the <span class="gemarra-regular">house </span>of one for whom benefit is forbidden by a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">was to be built, his fence to be erected, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">his field to be harvested, </span>and laborers were required but he had no money to hire them, the one from whom benefit is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">goes to the laborers and says</span> to them: <span class="gemarra-regular">Benefit from me is forbidden by vow to so-and-so and I do not know what I will do. And </span>the laborers <span class="gemarra-regular">perform </span>those tasks <span class="gemarra-regular">with him, and come and take payment </span>for their labor <span class="gemarra-regular">from that </span>person who approached them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the one who vowed to render benefit from him forbidden and the one for whom benefit is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">were traveling </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">along the roa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>the one for whom benefit is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have anything to eat, </span>the one who from whom benefit is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">to one </span>other person <span class="gemarra-regular">as a gift</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>person for whom benefit is forbidden to eat the food because it no longer belongs to the one from whom benefit is forbidden. <span class="gemarra-regular">If there is no other </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">with them, </span>the one who vowed <span class="gemarra-regular">places </span>the food <span class="gemarra-regular">on the </span>nearest <span class="gemarra-regular">rock or on the </span>nearest <span class="gemarra-regular">fence and says: These </span>food items <span class="gemarra-regular">are hereby rendered ownerless </span>and are available <span class="gemarra-regular">to anyone who wants </span>them. Then <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>person for whom benefit is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">takes and eats</span> the food. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei prohibits </span>doing so.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yosei whether one from whom benefit is forbidden to another can give the other person food by declaring the food ownerless, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yosei? He holds </span>that the legal status of the process of rendering property <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that of the acquisition of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift. Just as </span>acquisition of <span class="gemarra-regular">a gift </span>is not complete <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">comes from the possession of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">gives </span>the gift <span class="gemarra-regular">into the possession of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">receives </span>the gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>the process of rendering property <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless </span>is not complete <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">comes into the possession of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>it. According to Rabbi Yosei, it is prohibited for the one for whom benefit is forbidden to take the food that was declared ownerless. Since it still belongs to the one from whom benefit is forbidden, by taking the food he derives forbidden benefit from him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">takes and eats </span>the food; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Yosei prohibits </span>doing so. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said: When </span>is it prohibited to do so? <span class="gemarra-regular">When his vow predates his </span>declaration that the food is <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless. </span>In that case, the vow took effect on all his possessions, including those that he later declared ownerless. 

Daf 43b

<span class="gemarra-regular">However, if his declaration </span>that the food is <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless predates his vow, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for the other person to eat the food. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that the reason for the opinion of Rabbi Yosei is because the food remains in the possession of the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">until it comes into the possession of the one </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">for me </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">his vow predates his declaration </span>that the food is <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>different <span class="gemarra-regular">for me </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">his declaration </span>that the food is <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless predates his vow? </span>In any event, the item remains in the possession of its owner and the one for whom benefit is forbidden benefits from it. 
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">raised the objection and he answered </span>that objection. The difference between the cases does not relate to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of ownerless property; rather, it relates to the nature of vows. <span class="gemarra-regular">The intent of anyone who vows is </span>that the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>apply <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>an item <span class="gemarra-regular">that he rendered ownerless. </span>Therefore, when he declares the food ownerless and then vows, he does not intend to include the ownerless food in his vow, and the prohibition does not take effect upon it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised an objection:</span> With regard to a person on his deathbed who ordered his executor to distribute all his property, if he recovers, he may retract the gift. However, if he ordered him to distribute only a portion of his property and kept the rest, he cannot retract the gift. If he ordered him to distribute his property to two people and said: <span class="gemarra-regular">A portion of </span>the property is given <span class="gemarra-regular">to the first </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">and all of </span>the remaining property is given <span class="gemarra-regular">to the second </span>person, then if he recovered, the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired </span>the property that was given him, as it was a partial gift. 
And the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">did not acquire</span> the property that was given him, as it was a gift of all his remaining property, which can be retracted. Although the first person did not yet acquire the property, as the person on his deathbed did not die, the property is no longer considered to be in the possession of the one who owned it. This is clear from the fact that if it were still in his possession, the gift to the second person would not be a gift of all his remaining property. This contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said in explanation of the opinion of Rabbi Yosei: Acquisition of a gift is not complete until the item comes from the possession of the one who gives the gift into the possession of the one who receives the gift.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rava sai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the reason </span>for the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yosei: </span>It is prohibited by rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>for the one for whom benefit is forbidden to take food that was declared ownerless, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to the gift of Beit Ḥoron</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> An incident occurred in Beit Ḥoron involving a person who employed artifice and gave a gift to another to circumvent a vow. The Sages ruled that artifice of that sort is forbidden. Here too, when he renounced ownership he merely employed artifice to circumvent the vow. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who declares his field ownerless</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> for the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire three days </span>after that declaration <span class="gemarra-regular">he is able to retract </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">From this </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">forward, he is unable to retract </span>the declaration. 

Daf 44a

If <span class="gemarra-regular">one said: This field will be ownerless for one day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for one week, for one month, for one year, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">for one </span>seven-year Sabbatical cycle, <span class="gemarra-regular">as long as no one took possession of </span>the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither </span>the one who declared it ownerless <span class="gemarra-regular">nor another </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is able to retract </span>his declaration. <span class="gemarra-regular">Once one took possession </span>of the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is unable to retract </span>his declaration. This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is difficult, as <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>is apparently in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who hold that rendering property ownerless is unilateral and not contingent upon whether one took possession of it, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>who holds that rendering property ownerless is complete only when one takes possession of that property. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said: The latter clause is also </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, why </span>is the ruling in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">As long as one did not take possession of </span>the field, <span class="gemarra-regular">neither </span>the one who declared it ownerless <span class="gemarra-regular">nor another </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is able to retract </span>his declaration; according to the Rabbis, once he declared the property ownerless, although he can take possession of it, he is unable to retract the declaration. The Gemara answers: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is different </span>when one declares an item ownerless for <span class="gemarra-regular">a year or a seven-year </span>period, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>doing so is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncommon. </span>Since from the outset he limited the duration of ownerless status, clearly he reserved for himself certain rights; therefore, he can retract his declaration. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Reish Lakish said: From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the latter clause </span>is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, the first clause is also </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei. And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause, this is the reason</span> that one cannot retract his declaration once three days have passed: It is an ordinance instituted by the Sages to ensure <span class="gemarra-regular">that the </span>halakhic <span class="gemarra-regular">status of ownerlessness </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">not be forgotten. </span>If one could retract his declaration of ownerless status after three days, people would not distinguish between a case where another took possession, where, according to Rabbi Yosei, one is unable to retract the declaration, and a case where another did not take possession, where, according to Rabbi Yosei, one is able to retract the declaration. The result would be that people would mistakenly conclude that ownerless status can always be reversed, even after it was claimed by another. Therefore, the Sages instituted a limit of three days, after which one may not retract his declaration.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the Sages institute that the item <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless even from the first day as wel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> and that he cannot retract his declaration at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: </span>The reason that the Sages did not render the item ownerless from the first day <span class="gemarra-regular">is due to the swindlers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who declare </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless </span>in order to render the produce of the field exempt from the requirement of tithing, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">retract </span>that declaration and immediately reclaim the field. Therefore, the Sages instituted that ownerless status takes effect only after three days. 
The Gemara asks: The Sages instituted that one cannot retract his declaration of ownerless status once three days have passed. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, by Torah law, isn’t </span>the item <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless </span>according to Rabbi Yosei, regardless of when he retracted his declaration as long as no other person acquired it? 

Daf 44b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>that ordinance could lead to a problem, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">come to tith</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from </span>produce that <span class="gemarra-regular">requires </span>tithing by Torah law <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from tithing by Torah law <span class="gemarra-regular">and from </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">exempt </span>from tithing by Torah law <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>produce that <span class="gemarra-regular">requires </span>tithing by Torah law. By Torah law, the produce is not ownerless and requires tithing. However, due to the ordinance, people might relate to it as ownerless produce and assume that one is exempt from tithing it. Alternatively, they will erroneously conclude that the obligation to tithe from that produce is by rabbinic law and will tithe produce from it that one is exempt from tithing by Torah law, or they will tithe that produce from produce that one is exempt from tithing by Torah law. The result will be produce that is not properly tithed, as one may tithe produce that one is obligated to tithe by Torah law only from other produce that one is obligated to tithe by Torah law.
The Gemara answers: That problem will not arise, <span class="gemarra-regular">because</span> if the declaration of ownerless status is retracted after three days, <span class="gemarra-regular">we say to </span>the person who ultimately takes possession of the produce: <span class="gemarra-regular">When you tithe, tithe from </span>that produce <span class="gemarra-regular">itself. </span>In that way, the above problem does not arise. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who declares his vineyard ownerless</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and at dawn he arose and picked grapes </span>from the vineyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">is obligated in </span>the mitzva of leaving <span class="gemarra-regular">individual fallen </span>grapes left for the poor <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">peret</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], and in </span>the mitzva of leaving <span class="gemarra-regular">incompletely</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> formed clusters </span>of grapes for the poor <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">olelot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in </span>the mitzva of leaving <span class="gemarra-regular">forgotten </span>sheaves, <span class="gemarra-regular">and in </span>the mitzva of <span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> produce from the corner of the field or vineyard, as the obligation to separate those gifts from the poor is incumbent upon the one who harvests the field (see Leviticus 19:9–10). <span class="gemarra-regular">And he is exempt from </span>the obligation to separate <span class="gemarra-regular">the tithe </span>from the grapes. Because the vineyard is ownerless, there is no obligation to tithe the produce. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>this is so <span class="gemarra-regular">according to Ulla, </span>who explained <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Rabbis taught </span>the previous <span class="it-text">barait</span><span class="it-text">a</span> and explains that although the Sages instituted that the ownerless status does not take effect completely until three days have passed, by Torah law it takes effect immediately, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">taught in accordance with Torah law. </span>That is the reason that one is exempt from tithing the grapes. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, according to Reish Lakish, why is he exempt from</span> separating <span class="gemarra-regular">the tithe? </span>Until three days after the declaration, neither by Torah law nor by rabbinic law does ownerless status take effect.
The Gemara answers that Reish Lakish could have <span class="gemarra-regular">said to you: </span>Although <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>I explained the first clause and the latter clause of that <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">I said </span>that both are <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>who said that an ownerless item leaves the possession of the owner only when it enters the possession of another, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>who hold that it leaves the possession of the owner immediately upon the declaration of ownerless status. 

Daf 45a

<span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>instead: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, in which it is taught that the item does not leave the possession of the owner until it enters the possession of another, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one declared it ownerless <span class="gemarra-regular">before </span><span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>people; <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, in which it is taught that the item is ownerless when it is declared ownerless, is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one declared it ownerless <span class="gemarra-regular">before three </span>people. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who declares</span> an item <span class="gemarra-regular">ownerless before three </span>people, that item <span class="gemarra-regular">is ownerless; </span>if he does so <span class="gemarra-regular">before two </span>people, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not ownerless</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> By Torah law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, even with one </span>person, the item <span class="gemarra-regular">is ownerless, and what </span>is the <span class="gemarra-regular">reason</span> that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that ownerless status must be declared <span class="gemarra-regular">with three </span>people? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">so that one will take possession </span>of the item <span class="gemarra-regular">and two </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">testify </span>that the item was declared ownerless and that it was acquired by that person. It is not a requirement fundamental to the declaration of ownerless status. 


Daf 45b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Partners who vowed </span>not to derive <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from one another are prohibited from entering into a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">courtyar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> that they jointly own, since each one has a portion in it and benefits from the share owned by the other, thereby leading to a violation of the vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</span> It is permitted for both to use the courtyard, as it can be said that since each has a portion in the courtyard; <span class="gemarra-regular">this one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">enter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">into his own </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">and that one enters into his own </span>portion. 

Daf 46a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>all agree that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are both prohibite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from setting up a mil</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or an oven </span>in the jointly owned courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">or to raise chickens </span>in it.
If only <span class="gemarra-regular">one of the </span>partners <span class="gemarra-regular">was prohibited by a vo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from deriving benefit from the other, he may not enter the courtyard. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: He can say to </span>the partner: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am entering into my own </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">and I am not entering into your </span>portion. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">forces the one who took </span>such <span class="gemarra-regular">a vo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to sell his portio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> so that he does not cause the other to transgress.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">someone from the marketplac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit from one of the </span>partners, <span class="gemarra-regular">he may not enter a courtyard </span>of the partners, since it belongs partly to the one from whom he may not benefit. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: He can say to him: I am entering into the </span>portion <span class="gemarra-regular">of another </span>resident of the courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">and I am not entering your </span>own portion since it does not belong entirely to you.

If <span class="gemarra-regular">he has no right of usage in the </span>property, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted.</span>

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before</span> the Sages: In the mishna, the Rabbis and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree </span>with regard to the permissibility of entering a jointly owned courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the partners <span class="gemarra-regular">vowed </span>not to derive benefit from one another. However, if they instead <span class="gemarra-regular">vowed to prohibit one another </span>from deriving benefit from them and their property, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say that they disagree where </span>the partners <span class="gemarra-regular">each vowed </span>not to benefit from the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">but where they </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">vowed to prohibit one another </span>from deriving benefit from them, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis </span><span class="gemarra-regular">conced</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, as they are </span>each <span class="gemarra-regular">considered to be </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">due to circumstances beyond their control? Or perhaps the Rabbis disagree even in </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">each vowed to prohibit one another </span>from deriving benefit?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from the mishna: If only <span class="gemarra-regular">one of the </span>partners <span class="gemarra-regular">was prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit from the other, </span>he may not enter the shared courtyard. Here, the prohibitive vow was stated by the other party, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis disagree </span>and forbid the use of the courtyard. Evidently, the dispute in the mishna applies equally to cases beyond the control of the one forbidden by the vow. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Teach </span>an emended version of the mishna: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">had vowed to prohibit himself </span>from deriving <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from another. </span>According to this emended version, the mishna may be addressing only the one who brought the prohibition upon himself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">So too, it is reasonable </span>to assume that the mishna is referring to one who imposes the prohibition upon himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it was taught in the latter clause </span>with regard to the same case: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">forces the one who took </span>such <span class="gemarra-regular">a vow to sell his portion. Granted, if you say </span>that the mishna is speaking of a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">vowed </span>not to benefit from the other, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>consistent with <span class="gemarra-regular">that which teaches </span>that the court <span class="gemarra-regular">forces </span>him to sell his portion; since he created the problem, he is forced to resolve it. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say that </span>it is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the other prohibited him with a vow, why does </span>the court <span class="gemarra-regular">force him </span>to sell his property? <span class="gemarra-regular">He is put in a situation beyond his control. </span>This clause offers no proof, and the Rabbis may still concede in a case where one is forbidden due to another’s vow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Ze’eiri said: </span>

Daf 46b

The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>between Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov and the Rabbis is with regard to a courtyard <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is sufficient </span>area <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the courtyard for it to be <span class="gemarra-regular">divide</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> into four square cubits for each partner, so each can be said to have a real portion that can be forbidden to the other. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">there is not sufficient </span>area <span class="gemarra-regular">in it </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">divided</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> everyone agrees </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to benefit from it, since the entire courtyard is viewed as belonging to both of them and each one can say that he is entering his own portion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said to </span>Rabba: <span class="gemarra-regular">A synagogu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> belongs to the entire public and is therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">considered like </span>a courtyard in which <span class="gemarra-regular">there is not sufficient </span>area <span class="gemarra-regular">in it </span>to be <span class="gemarra-regular">divided,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and we learned in </span>a mishna later in the chapter (48a) that with regard to two people who vow not to derive benefit from each other, <span class="gemarra-regular">both are prohibited </span>from deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from an entity </span><span class="gemarra-regular">belonging to that city </span>such as a synagogue. Evidently, the Rabbis prohibit deriving benefit even from such entities.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Yosef said: Ze’eiri </span>must have <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>holds <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is not sufficient </span>area <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the courtyard for it to be <span class="gemarra-regular">divided, but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">there is sufficient </span>area <span class="gemarra-regular">in it </span>for it to be <span class="gemarra-regular">divided, everyone agrees that </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since if either enters it he may be entering the other’s portion.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov. And so too, Rabbi Elazar said:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov.</span>
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit from another </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and he has a bathhouse </span>or an olive press in the city that is leased out and available for public use, the forbidden party may use it only if the owner has forfeited his own right to profits from usage. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And how much </span>is this <span class="gemarra-regular">right </span>to profits from <span class="gemarra-regular">usage </span>that prohibits the subject of the vow from entering the bathhouse? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>In cases where he receives <span class="gemarra-regular">one half, one-third</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or one-quarter </span>of the profits of the bathhouse. <span class="gemarra-regular">But in </span>a case where he receives <span class="gemarra-regular">less, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>forbidden. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Even in </span>a case where he receives <span class="gemarra-regular">less, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what are the circumstances in which </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>and he is not considered to have a right to profits from usage? <span class="gemarra-regular">Where he </span>completely forfeits all profits and <span class="gemarra-regular">receives </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">an annual rental fee [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">taska</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> from a tenant. 

Daf 47a

§ The mishna teaches: With regard to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who says to another: </span>Entering your house is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, and the owner dies or sells the house, the prohibition is lifted. But if he said: Entering this house is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, he remains prohibited from entering the house even after the owner dies or sells the house. <span class="gemarra-regular">Avimi raises a dilemma: </span>If the owner of a house said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Entering this house is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and then <span class="gemarra-regular">he died or sold it to another, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Do we say that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">render an item in his possession forbidden </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>a time <span class="gemarra-regular">after it will leave his possession, or not?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Bava</span> <span class="it-text">Kamma</span> 108b–109a): If <span class="gemarra-regular">one says to his son: Benefiting from me is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for you, and dies, </span>the son still <span class="gemarra-regular">inherits </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him. </span>If, however, the father explicitly states that benefit is forbidden both <span class="gemarra-regular">in his lifetime and after his death</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and dies, </span>the son <span class="gemarra-regular">does not inherit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rava suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">render an item in his possession forbidde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> even <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>a time <span class="gemarra-regular">after it will leave his possession. </span>The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from </span>the mishna that this is so.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>(57a): If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">This produce is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon my mouth, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for my mouth, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from eating even <span class="gemarra-regular">its replacements, </span>should they be traded or exchanged, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>anything that <span class="gemarra-regular">grows from it </span>if it is replanted.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama raises a dilemma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> If one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: This produce is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for so-and-so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to their replacements</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say: With regard to himself, since a person can render another’s produce forbidden for himself, </span>though it is not presently in his possession, so too, <span class="gemarra-regular">a person can render an entity that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come into the world forbidden to himself? </span>Is this why the replacement produce and anything that grows from it is forbidden to him, even if it did not yet exist when he took the vow? If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to another, since a person cannot render another’s produce forbidden to another, </span>i.e., to that owner himself, similarly <span class="gemarra-regular">one cannot render an entity that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come into the world forbidden to another. </span>The produce’s replacements would therefore be permitted to him. 

Daf 47b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>the prohibition on replacement produce in the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that replacements </span>of the produce are viewed as being <span class="gemarra-regular">like that which grow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> from them? They are both forbidden because they derive from the forbidden produce. If this is the case, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is no different </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">him and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is no different </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">another. </span>Neither may derive benefit from the replacements.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Minyumi said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to his wife: Benefiting from me is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> she may </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">borrow </span>money to sustain herself, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the creditors can come and collec</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> her debts from her husband. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the creditors can collect </span>from the husband? <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it not because </span>she benefits only indirectly, and it must be <span class="gemarra-regular">that replacements, </span>i.e., the creditors’ money, <span class="gemarra-regular">are not like that which grows </span>from the original item?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>This is not proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps it is </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">that one should not</span> benefit from replacements <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but if one did </span>it, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">done </span>after the fact. Since the wife lacks any other means to support herself, the case is considered to be after the fact, and it is permitted for her to benefit indirectly. Still, replacements of an item are considered to be like that which grows from it <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof from another mishna (<span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 56b): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who betroths </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>fruit of <span class="gemarra-italic">orla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., fruit of the first three years of a tree’s growth, from which it is forbidden to benefit, <span class="gemarra-regular">she is not betrothed </span>because the fruits have no value.

But if <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold them and betrothed her with the money </span>he received, <span class="gemarra-regular">she is betrothed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Evidently, replacements of a forbidden item are permitted. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here also, one should not </span>benefit from the replacement items given in exchange for the <span class="it-text">orla</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ab</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">initio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but if one did </span>it, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">done </span>after the fact.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If someone says to another: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to you </span>like an item <span class="gemarra-regular">dedicated </span>to the Temple, then <span class="gemarra-regular">the one prohibited by </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">vow is prohibited </span>from benefiting from the possessions of the one who took the vow.

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna appears to teach that one who is prohibited by a vow from benefiting from another may not benefit from property written over to the <span class="it-text">Nasi</span>. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why is it forbidden?

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit from another and he does not have anything to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the other <span class="gemarra-regular">may give </span>the food <span class="gemarra-regular">to someone else as a gift and he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">it. </span>The mishna recounts: <span class="gemarra-regular">An incident </span>occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">involving someone in </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥoro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">whose father had vowed not to derive benefit from him, and </span>the son <span class="gemarra-regular">was marrying off his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">son </span>and wanted his father to be able to participate in the wedding meal. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>he therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">said to another: The courtyard </span>where the wedding will take place <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the wedding <span class="gemarra-regular">meal are given before you </span>as a gift, but <span class="gemarra-regular">only so that my father will come and eat with us at the meal.</span>
The recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">said: If they are mine, they are </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">hereby consecrated to Heaven, </span>i.e., the Temple, and are forbidden to everyone. The son <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>in anger: And <span class="gemarra-regular">did I give you my </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">so that you should consecrate it to Heaven? He, </span>the recipient, <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You gave me your </span>property <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>so that <span class="gemarra-regular">you and your father would eat and drink and </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">appease each other, and the sin </span>of transgressing the vow would <span class="gemarra-regular">be hung on his, </span>i.e., my, <span class="gemarra-regular">head, </span>as I enabled the transgression. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Any gif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that is not </span>so absolute so <span class="gemarra-regular">that if </span>the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">were to consecrate </span>the gift <span class="gemarra-regular">it would be consecrated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not a gift. </span>In other words, in order for it to be a gift, the recipient must have the ability to consecrate it. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: Was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident </span>cited <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contradic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> that which was initially stated in the mishna? The mishna explicitly stated that one may give a gift to another in order to bypass the prohibition of a vow. The Gemara answers: The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete and is teaching</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> like </span><span class="gemarra-regular">this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">And if his ultimate </span>actions <span class="gemarra-regular">prove </span>the nature of <span class="gemarra-regular">his initial </span>intent, i.e., if the prior owner protests that he gave the gift only as a technicality in order to bypass the vow, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>to illustrate this point, <span class="gemarra-regular">there was also an incident in Beit Ḥoron concerning someone whose ultimate </span>protest <span class="gemarra-regular">proved </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">his initial </span>intent was not to give a true gift.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: They taught </span>this prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he said to him: And </span>the gifts <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>given <span class="gemarra-regular">before you only so that </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father should come, </span>as he explicitly mentioned that he did not intend to give an absolute gift. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to him </span>less explicitly: <span class="gemarra-regular">That they should be before you that </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father should come, </span>there is no prohibition, <span class="gemarra-regular">since he is </span>essentially <span class="gemarra-regular">saying to him: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">up to your judgment </span>whether or not to invite him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Some say another version </span>of this statement. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Do not say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the reason </span>for the prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">is because he said to him: And </span>the gifts <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>given <span class="gemarra-regular">before you </span>only so that my father will come, and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is why <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden; but </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to him: They are before you so </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father should come and eat, </span>it would be <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. </span>This is not so. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, even if he said to him: They are before you, </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father should come and eat, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden. What is the reason </span>for this? <span class="gemarra-regular">His </span>wedding <span class="gemarra-regular">meal proves about hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> that his sole intention was to bypass the vow. 

Daf 48b

There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who had a son who seized </span>in theft <span class="gemarra-regular">sheaves [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">keifei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] of flax</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the father took a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibiting </span>his son <span class="gemarra-regular">from</span> deriving any benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from his possessions. They said </span>to the father: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if the son of your so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> would become a Torah scholar, </span>and you would want him to be able to inherit your possessions, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>would you do? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: Let this </span>son of mine <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire </span>the possessions, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> only <span class="gemarra-regular">if the son of my son becomes a Torah scholar </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">let him, </span>my grandson, <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire them </span>from my son. They asked: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the ruling?
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">of Pumbedita say: </span>This is just as if he stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">Acquire </span>the property <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that you transfe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> it to your son. In such a case he has not given anything to the recipient, but has merely made him a conduit to transfer the item to someone else. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>case where one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Acquire </span>this item <span class="gemarra-regular">on the condition that you transfer </span>ownership, the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">does not acquire </span>the item, and the statement has no effect.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But Rav Naḥman said: He does acquire, as an </span>acquisition by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a clot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>a case of an act of <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition </span>performed only <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to transfer </span>ownership. In such a case, one gives another a cloth in order to confer ownership of some other item, but the cloth itself does not assume new ownership. Still, this is an effective means of acquisition. So too, the property of the grandfather may be effectively conferred upon the grandson through the son, without the son acquiring it himself.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: And who will say to us concerning the cloth that if </span>the recipient of the cloth would <span class="gemarra-regular">seize it </span>with the intention of keeping it that it would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>be an effective <span class="gemarra-regular">seizure? </span>While the cloth is technically transferred, the recipient does not usually exercise his right to it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>an acquisition by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">a clot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> is a case where the giver is saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">Acquire </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to transfer </span>ownership, <span class="gemarra-regular">but acquire from now</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> However, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">these possessions of this </span>one who took the vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">when does </span>the son <span class="gemarra-regular">acquire? </span>Only <span class="gemarra-regular">when his son’s son becomes a Torah scholar. And when he becomes </span>a Torah scholar, <span class="gemarra-regular">the cloth has </span>already been <span class="gemarra-regular">returned to its owner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the act of acquisition had taken place long before the grandson became a Torah scholar. The initial transfer therefore has no effect.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rav Naḥman: But the gift of Beit Ḥoro</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> discussed in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>an example of an <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition </span>performed only <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to transfer </span>ownership, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>there <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not acquire </span>it at all.
The Gemara recounts: <span class="gemarra-regular">Sometimes</span> when Rav Naḥman was asked this question <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to him: </span>That is <span class="gemarra-regular">because his </span>wedding <span class="gemarra-regular">meal proves about hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> that he did not truly intend to give the items to the recipient, and not because such an acquisition is invalid per se. <span class="gemarra-regular">And sometimes he said to hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> that in <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> case they followed the stringent opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, who said: Even </span>negligible benefits ordinarily <span class="gemarra-regular">waived </span>are <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidde</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to one prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit </span>from another. So too, Rabbi Eliezer holds that one cannot rely on an act of acquisition performed merely in order to transfer ownership to a third party.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna (48a): <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Any gift that is not </span>so absolute so <span class="gemarra-regular">that, if </span>the recipient <span class="gemarra-regular">were to consecrate </span>the gift <span class="gemarra-regular">it would be consecrated, is not a gift. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is added </span>by the word: <span class="gemarra-regular">Any? Is it not adding this matter of </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">seized sheaves </span>of flax, and to say that the gift of the father has no effect? The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the intent is <span class="gemarra-regular">to add the latter version of the </span>aforementioned <span class="gemarra-regular">statement of Rava, </span>that a gift given as a means of circumventing a vow has no effect, even when the giver mentions the nature of the gift only casually and does not stipulate it as a formal condition. 


Daf 49a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">cooked foods</span> are forbidden to him, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">roasted and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">boile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> foods, as they are not defined as cooked. If one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Cooked </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not taste </span>it, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from </span>tasting <span class="gemarra-regular">a loose cooked </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to </span>taste <span class="gemarra-regular">a thick </span>one, which people do not generally refer to as a cooked food. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>he is likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to </span>eat <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">turemuta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> egg and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">remutza</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gourd, </span>as they are not considered cooked foods either. In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that food <span class="gemarra-regular">cooked in a dish </span>is forbidden to him, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from deriving benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">only from </span>food that is <span class="gemarra-regular">cooked by </span><span class="gemarra-regular">boilin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> it in a dish. However, if <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: That which enters into a dish is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not taste </span>it, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from tasting <span class="gemarra-regular">anything cooked in a dish. </span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of one who vowed that cooked foods are forbidden to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoshiya </span>maintains that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from eating roasted foods. <span class="gemarra-regular">And although there is no </span>biblical <span class="gemarra-regular">proof of the matter, there is an allusion to the matter, as it is stated: “And they cooked the Paschal offering with fire according to the ordinance” </span>(II Chronicles 35:13). Since the Paschal offering must be roasted, it is evident that roasting can also be referred to as cooking. 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that they disagree with regard to this </span>following principle, <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi Yoshiya holds </span>that one should <span class="gemarra-regular">follow the language of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and our </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to vows </span>one should <span class="gemarra-regular">follow the language of people</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara refutes this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is possible <span class="gemarra-regular">that everyone </span>agrees that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to vows </span>one should <span class="gemarra-regular">follow the language of people. </span>Rather, this <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage </span>stated his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the language of <span class="gemarra-regular">his locale, and </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">Sage </span>stated his opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the language of <span class="gemarra-regular">his locale. In the locale of our </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, roasted food is called roasted and cooked food is called cooked, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">in the locale of Rabbi Yoshiya </span><span class="gemarra-regular">even roasted food is called cooked. </span>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But doesn’t </span>Rabbi Yoshiya <span class="gemarra-regular">cite a verse </span>as proof for his opinion, which shows that his opinion is not based on the vernacular? The Gemara answers: The verse is cited as <span class="gemarra-regular">a mere support </span>for his opinion, as implied by his statement that the verse is only an allusion, not a full proof. 
It is stated in the mishna that one who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">A cooked </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me and for that reason I will not taste it, he is prohibited from tasting a loose cooked food but is permitted to taste a thick one. The Gemara asks: Why is he permitted to eat it? <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t he vow </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a cooked </span>food, which includes one that is thick, is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: This </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> maintains that <span class="gemarra-regular">anything with which bread is eaten is called a cooked </span>food, whereas a thick dish is eaten without bread. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught </span>likewise in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a cooked </span>food is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from </span>eating <span class="gemarra-regular">all types of cooked </span>foods, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he is therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from </span>eating <span class="gemarra-regular">roasted, boiled, and cooked </span>foods. <span class="gemarra-regular">And he is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from </span>eating <span class="gemarra-regular">soft gourds [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hiteriyyot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with which the sick eat their bread. </span>This indicates that a cooked food is one eaten with bread.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is that so, </span>that the sick eat gourds? <span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabbi Yirmeya fell ill, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain doctor came to him to heal him. He saw a gour</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that was placed in his house, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he left </span>Rabbi Yirmeya <span class="gemarra-regular">and exited </span>the house and <span class="gemarra-regular">said: This </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">has an angel of death, </span>a gourd, <span class="gemarra-regular">in his house, and I will enter to heal him? </span>This incident teaches that gourds are detrimental for the sick. 
The Gemara responds: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult. This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to soft </span>gourds, which are beneficial to the sick, and <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>incident is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to hard </span>ones, which are detrimental. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava bar Ulla said </span>a different answer: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>incident is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the gourd itself, </span>which is detrimental, <span class="gemarra-regular">and this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the innards [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">luliva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the gourd, as Rav Yehuda said: The innards of the gourd </span>are best eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">with chard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the innards of flax </span>seeds are best eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kuteḥa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a dip made from bread crumbs and sour milk. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may not sa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this matter in the presence of an ignoramus, </span>so that ignoramuses do not uproot flax for consumption of its seeds. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>a different response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who are </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">sick </span>mentioned in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, for whom a gourd is beneficial? They are <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages, </span>who are weakened by their toil in the study of Torah and their abstention from worldly pleasures, although they are not actually sick. Therefore, there is no contradiction. Gourds are harmful for people who are actually sick. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava </span>conforms <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>standard line of <span class="gemarra-regular">reasoning, as Rava said: </span>

Daf 49b

<span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">do we pray </span>every day <span class="gemarra-regular">for the sick and for the suffering? In accordance with whose </span>opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who holds that one is judged every day, not only on Rosh HaShana, and therefore it is appropriate to pray for people every day. <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that he said: The sick and the suffering, </span>one can <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from </span>his statement that the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">The sick, </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">actual sick </span>people, while the term: <span class="gemarra-regular">The suffering, </span>is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages, </span>who typically are physically frail.
§ It is stated in the mishna that one who vowed that loose cooked food is forbidden to him is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to </span>taste <span class="gemarra-regular">a thick </span>cooked food. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">The mishna is not in accordance with the </span>custom of the <span class="gemarra-regular">Babylonians, as Rabbi Zeir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said: Babylonians are foolish, as they eat bread with bread. </span>They eat thick porridge with their bread, which is essentially eating one kind of bread with another. According to their custom, one who vows that cooked foods are forbidden to him is prohibited from eating even a thick cooked food. 
In that context, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said that those fastidious </span>resi-dents <span class="gemarra-regular">of Huzal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Babylonia <span class="gemarra-regular">were asked: How is it best to eat this porridge? </span>Should <span class="gemarra-regular">wheat </span>porridge be eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">with wheat bread and barley </span>porridge <span class="gemarra-regular">with barley bread, or perhaps wheat </span>porridge should be eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">with barley </span>bread <span class="gemarra-regular">and barley </span>porridge <span class="gemarra-regular">with wheat </span>bread? 
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava would eat </span>his bread <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥasisei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a porridge made of toasted barley grains. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, son of Rav Huna, found Rav Huna eating porridge with his fingers. He said to him: Why is the Master eating with his hands? </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: Porridge </span>eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">with a finger is tasty, and all the more so </span>if it is eaten <span class="gemarra-regular">with two </span>fingers, <span class="gemarra-regular">and all the more so with three. </span>It is more enjoyable to eat porridge with your hands. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said to his son Ḥiyya, and Rav Huna similarly said to his son Rabba: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">you are invited to eat porridge, </span>for such a meal you should travel <span class="gemarra-regular">up to </span>the distance of <span class="gemarra-regular">a parasang </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">parsa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If you are invited <span class="gemarra-regular">to eat ox meat, </span>you should travel <span class="gemarra-regular">up to three parasangs. Rav said to his son Ḥiyya, and Rav Huna similarly said to his son Rabba: You should not spit out anything before your teacher, </span>as this is disrespectful, <span class="gemarra-regular">apart from gourd and porridge, as they are like </span>a burning <span class="gemarra-regular">lead wic</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> in the intestines when they cannot be digested, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">spit </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">out even before King Shapur, </span>due to the danger involved. 
The Gemara relates more incidents: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Yehuda </span>dined together. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">ate porridge with his fingers, and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one ate with a fork [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hutza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The one <span class="gemarra-regular">who was eating with a fork said to </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who was eating with his fingers: For how long will you </span>keep <span class="gemarra-regular">feeding me your filth? </span>Must I keep eating off of your dirty fingernails? The one <span class="gemarra-regular">who was eating with his fingers said to </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who was eating with a fork: For how long will you </span>keep <span class="gemarra-regular">feeding me your spittle</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as you eat with a fork which you then put back in the common bowl.
<span class="gemarra-italic">Belospayin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a type of figs, <span class="gemarra-regular">were brought before Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yehuda ate</span> them, but <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon did not eat </span>them. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said to him: What is the reason </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">Master is not eating? Rabbi Shimon said to him: These do not leave the intestines at all. </span>They remain undigested. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said to him: </span>If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more that one can rely on them </span>to feel full <span class="gemarra-regular">tomorrow. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda was sitting before Rabbi Tarfon. Rabbi Tarfon said to him: Your face today is ruddy, </span>i.e., a rosy, healthy color. Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Last night your servants, </span>i.e., we students, <span class="gemarra-regular">went out to the field, and beets were brought to us, and we ate them without salt. </span>This is the reason for our healthy complexion. <span class="gemarra-regular">And had we eaten them with salt, all the more so would our faces have been ruddy. </span>
The Gemara cites related incidents: <span class="gemarra-regular">A certain </span>gentile <span class="gemarra-regular">lady [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">matronita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to Rabbi Yehuda, </span>whose face was ruddy: How can one <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>the Jews <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">a drunk </span>at the same time? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to her: </span>I place my <span class="gemarra-regular">integrity in the hands of this woman </span>and should no longer be deemed credible <span class="gemarra-regular">if I </span>ever <span class="gemarra-regular">taste </span>any wine <span class="gemarra-regular">except </span>for that of <span class="gemarra-italic">kiddush</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">havdala</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and the four cups of Passover. And </span>after I drink those four cups <span class="gemarra-regular">I tie my temple</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from Passover </span><span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shavuot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>as wine gives me a headache. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>my complexion is explained by the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“A man’s wisdom makes his face to shine” </span>(Ecclesiastes 8:1). 
<span class="gemarra-regular">A certain heretic said to Rabbi Yehuda: Your face is similar either to usurers or to pig breeders. </span>These people would earn a good living without expending much energy, which gave them plump, healthy complexions. Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Both </span>of these occupations <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited to Jews. Rather, </span>my face is ruddy because <span class="gemarra-regular">I have twenty-four bathroom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> on the way <span class="gemarra-regular">from my home to the study hall, and all the time I enter each and every one </span>of them. He did not suffer from constipation, which had a beneficial effect on his complexion. 
§ The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rabbi Yehuda would go to the study hall he would carry a pitcher </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gulefa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on his shoulder </span>to sit on, <span class="gemarra-regular">saying: Labor is great, as it brings honor to the laborer </span>who performs <span class="gemarra-regular">it. </span>It brought him honor by enabling him to avoid sitting on the floor of the study hall. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon would carry a basket on his shoulder, saying: Labor is great, as it brings honor to the laborer </span>who performs <span class="gemarra-regular">it. </span>
The Gemara further relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda’s wife went out </span>to the market, <span class="gemarra-regular">collected wool, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">made a thick [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hutevei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> cloak. When she would go out to the market she would cover herself with it, and when Rabbi Yehuda would go out to pray he would cover himself </span>with the cloak <span class="gemarra-regular">and pray. And when he </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">cover himself with it he would recite the blessing: Blessed is He who wrapped me in a coat, </span>as he took much pleasure in it. 
On <span class="gemarra-regular">one occasion Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, </span>the <span class="it-text">Nasi</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">decreed a fast. Rabbi Yehuda did not come to the house of the fast, </span>where everyone gathered. The people <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel: Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have </span>a dignified garment to <span class="gemarra-regular">cover </span>himself with, and therefore he shies away from public events. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">sent him a cloak </span>of his own, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">did not accept </span>this gift. 

Daf 50a

<span class="gemarra-regular">He lifted the mat [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tzifeta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> upon which he was sitting <span class="gemarra-regular">and said to the messenger: See what there is </span>here. The place was miraculously filled with gold dinars. This demonstrated that Rabbi Yehuda could have had plenty of money if he had so desired. He explained: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, it is not amenable to me to derive benefit in this world. </span>
§ In connection to the above incident concerning the poverty of scholars and their potential to become wealthy through remarkable circumstances, the Gemara relates an incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> became betrothed to the daughter of bar Kalba Savua</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> When <span class="gemarra-regular">bar Kalba Savua heard </span>about their betrothal, he took a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibiting her from </span>eating <span class="gemarra-regular">all of his property. </span>Despite this, <span class="gemarra-regular">she went </span>ahead <span class="gemarra-regular">and married </span>Rabbi Akiva. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">In the winter they would sleep in a storehouse of straw, </span>and Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">would gather </span>strands of <span class="gemarra-regular">straw from her hair. He said to her: If I had </span>the means <span class="gemarra-regular">I would place on your </span>head <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jerusalem of Gold</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a type of crown. <span class="gemarra-regular">Elijah </span>the prophet <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">appeared to them as </span>a regular <span class="gemarra-regular">person and </span>started <span class="gemarra-regular">calling </span>and knocking <span class="gemarra-regular">on the door. He said to them: Give me a bit of straw, as my wife gave birth and I do not have anything on which to lay her. Rabbi Akiva said to his wife: See </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">man, who does not even have straw. </span>We should be happy with our lot, as we at least have straw to sleep on. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">She said to him: Go </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">be a student </span>of Torah. <span class="gemarra-regular">He went </span>and studied Torah for <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve years before Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua. At the completion of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve years, he was coming home </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">he heard from behind his house that one wicked person was saying to his wife: Your father behaved well toward you.</span> He was right to disinherit you. <span class="gemarra-regular">One </span>reason is <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>your husband <span class="gemarra-regular">is not similar to you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he is not suitable for you. <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, he has left you in widowhood in his lifetime all these years. She said to him: If he listens to me, he should be </span>there for <span class="gemarra-regular">another twelve years. </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Since she has given me permission </span>through this statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">I will go back</span> and study more. <span class="gemarra-regular">He turned back </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">went </span>to the study hall, and he <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>there for <span class="gemarra-regular">another twelve years.</span>
Eventually <span class="gemarra-regular">he came </span>back accompanied <span class="gemarra-regular">by 24,000 pairs of students. Everyone went out to </span>greet <span class="gemarra-regular">him, </span>as he was by then a renowned teacher, <span class="gemarra-regular">and she too arose to go out to </span>greet <span class="gemarra-regular">him. That wicked person said to her: And to where are you </span>going? As she was excessively poor, she was not dressed in a grand manner, as fit for the wife of one so esteemed. <span class="gemarra-regular">She said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">“A righteous man regards the life of his beast</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> (Proverbs 12:10); he knows that I am in this state as a result of my dedication to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">She came to present herself before </span>Rabbi Akiva, but <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages </span>tried to <span class="gemarra-regular">fend her off,</span> as they were unaware of her identity. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: Leave her. </span>Both <span class="gemarra-regular">my </span>Torah knowledge <span class="gemarra-regular">and yours are hers. </span>When <span class="gemarra-regular">bar Kalba Savua heard </span>that the famous man was his son-in-law, <span class="gemarra-regular">he came </span>before halakhic authorities <span class="gemarra-regular">and requested the dissolution of his vow, and it was</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> dissolved. </span>
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva became wealthy from six things. </span>First, <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the money he received from <span class="gemarra-regular">Kalba Savua </span>after his vow was dissolved. Second, he gained money <span class="gemarra-regular">from the ram of a ship [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eila</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">disfineta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>craftsmen would <span class="gemarra-regular">fashion </span>a sculpture of <span class="gemarra-regular">a type of sheep for every ship, </span>which would be placed on its bow, and which would be used to conceal money. On <span class="gemarra-regular">one occasion, </span>the sailors <span class="gemarra-regular">forgot </span>this ram <span class="gemarra-regular">on the seashore, </span>and Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">found it </span>with the money stored inside. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>third, he became wealthy <span class="gemarra-regular">from a log </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">gavza</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of wood, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">one occasion he gave four dinars to sailors </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Bring me something </span>worthwhile. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they found only a log </span>of wood <span class="gemarra-regular">on the seashore. They brought it to him </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: May our master wait with this </span>until we bring a more worthy item. <span class="gemarra-regular">He found that </span>the log <span class="gemarra-regular">was full of dinars,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">one occasion a ship sunk and all the merchandise, </span>i.e., the money, owned by the people on the ship <span class="gemarra-regular">was placed in that log, and it was found on that occasion </span>by the sailors. 
Rabbi Akiva became wealthy <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a convoy of <span class="gemarra-regular">Ishmaelites [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">Serukita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>he became wealthy <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a certain <span class="gemarra-regular">lady. </span>Rabbi Akiva borrowed money from a lady and said that God would be his guarantor. When it came time to return the loan, the king’s daughter became insane and threw a purse of jewelry into the sea, which was found by that lady. She told Rabbi Akiva that his guarantor had paid his debt and she allowed him to keep the loan. 

Daf 50b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rabbi Akiva also grew wealthy <span class="gemarra-regular">from the wife of Turnus Rufus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who converted and gave him her money, <span class="gemarra-regular">and from Ketia bar Shalom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a Roman minister who bequeathed his fortune to him.
§ The Gemara relates a similar incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Gamda gave four dinars to sailors to bring </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">something </span>from overseas in exchange <span class="gemarra-regular">for them. </span>However, they <span class="gemarra-regular">did not find </span>anything of worth, so <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>bought him <span class="gemarra-regular">a monkey with </span>the coins and <span class="gemarra-regular">brought it to him. </span>The monkey <span class="gemarra-regular">escaped </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">entered a hole. </span>When <span class="gemarra-regular">they dug after it </span>to retrieve it, <span class="gemarra-regular">they found it crouching over pearls, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">they brought all of </span>the pearls <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>Rav Gamda.
<span class="gemarra-regular">The daughter of the emperor said to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: </span>You are the epitome of <span class="gemarra-regular">magnificent Torah, </span>but it is stored <span class="gemarra-regular">in an ugly vessel, </span>as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya was an unattractive man. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to her: You may learn </span>the answer to your statement <span class="gemarra-regular">from your father’s house. In what </span>container <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>you <span class="gemarra-regular">place wine? She said to him: In earthenware vessels. He said to her: </span>Is it conceivable that <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone </span>stores their wine <span class="gemarra-regular">in earthenware </span>vessels, <span class="gemarra-regular">and you </span>also store it <span class="gemarra-regular">in earthenware vessels? </span>Is there no distinction between the emperor and ordinary people? <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">place </span>your wine <span class="gemarra-regular">in vessels </span><span class="gemarra-regular">of silver and gold. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">She went and placed the wine in vessels of silver and gold</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and it spoiled. </span>Rabbi Yehoshua <span class="gemarra-regular">said to her: The same is </span>also true of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah. </span>It spoils if it is contained in a handsome person. She asked him: <span class="gemarra-regular">But are there not </span>people who are both <span class="gemarra-regular">good </span>looking <span class="gemarra-regular">and learned </span>in Torah? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to her: If they were ugl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they would be </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">more learned. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">A certain woman came before Rav Yehuda of </span>the city of <span class="gemarra-regular">Neharde’a for judgment, and she was found guilty in the judgment </span>of her case. <span class="gemarra-regular">She said to him: Would Shmuel your teacher </span><span class="gemarra-regular">have judged </span>me <span class="gemarra-regular">in this </span>manner? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to her: Did you know him? She said to him: Yes. </span>He was <span class="gemarra-regular">short and potbellied. </span>He was <span class="gemarra-regular">dark and his teeth were large. He said to her: Did you come </span>here <span class="gemarra-regular">to disparage him </span>by describing him in this manner? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let that woman be in </span>a state of <span class="gemarra-regular">excommunication. </span>After he excommunicated her, her belly <span class="gemarra-regular">split open and she died, </span>as a punishment for having disparaged a Torah scholar.
§ The mishna teaches that if one said: Cooked food is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, and for that reason I will not taste it, he is prohibited from tasting a loose cooked food but is permitted to taste a thick one, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he is likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to </span>eat <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">turemita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> egg. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is a <span class="gemarra-italic">turemita</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> egg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shmuel said: A slave who </span>knows how to <span class="gemarra-regular">prepare it is worth a thousand dinars. And </span>this is how one prepares it: <span class="gemarra-regular">He insets it into hot water a thousand times and in cold water a thousand times, until it shrink</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> enough <span class="gemarra-regular">so that it can be swallowed </span>whole. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if there is a lesio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> in one’s intestines, part of the lesion <span class="gemarra-regular">adheres to </span>the egg, <span class="gemarra-regular">and when </span>the egg <span class="gemarra-regular">emerges the doctor knows what medicine </span>the patient <span class="gemarra-regular">requires and with what </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">can be healed. </span>It is therefore an important dish for medicinal purposes. 
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel would examine himself with a stal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> that he would swallow for this purpose. This would weaken his body and cause him to look faint <span class="gemarra-regular">to such an extent that the members of his household would tear their hairs out for him </span>in grief, as they would think he was dying. 
Besides vows, there are other areas of <span class="it-text">halakha</span> where there is a distinction between different varieties of the same food. <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>(<span class="it-text">Ma’asrot</span> 2:8): A hired worker who <span class="gemarra-regular">was working with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">keloppasin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a type of fig, <span class="gemarra-regular">may not partake of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">benot</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">sheva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>a different species of fig, during his work. A worker may partake only of the fruit that he is handling at the time (see Deuteronomy 23:25–26). Similarly, if he was working <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">benot</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">sheva</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he may not partake of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">keloppasin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are </span><span class="gemarra-italic">keloppasin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">A type of fig from which compote [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lifdei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is made. </span>
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who gave a slave to his friend so that </span>the friend would <span class="gemarra-regular">teach him </span>how to prepare <span class="gemarra-regular">a thousand varieties of compote </span>from figs. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">he taught him </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">eight hundred. He </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">brought </span>his friend <span class="gemarra-regular">for judgment before Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Our forefathers said: We have forgotten prosperity </span>(see Lamentations 3:17). They forgot the opulence they enjoyed in better times, but they at least experienced it. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">we have not even seen </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">with our eyes. </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi had not imagined that so many types of compote could be prepared from figs.
§ The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">made a wedding for Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. Someone <span class="gemarra-regular">wrote on the canopy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> 24,000 myriad dinars were expended on this canopy, and </span>nevertheless Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">did not invite bar Kappara</span> to the wedding. The insulted bar Kappara <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <span class="gemarra-regular">If to those who transgress </span>God’s <span class="gemarra-regular">will, </span>i.e., you who act improperly, their reward is <span class="gemarra-regular">such, </span>as Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was very wealthy, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so those who perform His will </span>are to be rewarded. Upon hearing his reaction, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">invited him. </span>Bar Kappara then <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">to those who perform His will </span>their reward is <span class="gemarra-regular">such in this world,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> all the more so </span>will they be rewarded <span class="gemarra-regular">in the World-to-Come.</span>
The Gemara relates additional incidents that occurred between the two scholars. <span class="gemarra-regular">On a day when Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">would laugh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> calamity would befall the world, </span>as Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s sufferings would atone for the sins of the Jewish people. <span class="gemarra-regular">He </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">said to bar Kappara: Do not cause me to laugh, and I will give you forty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of wheat </span>in return. Bar Kappara <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him:</span> The <span class="gemarra-regular">Master will see </span>

Daf 51a

<span class="gemarra-regular">that any </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> I wish I will take. He took a large palm basket, smeared it with tar, and overturned it upon his head, and went, and said to </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let the Master measure for me </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">forty </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of wheat that I am owed by you. Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">laughed </span>at this and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Did I not warn you not to make me laugh? He said to him: </span>What <span class="gemarra-regular">I am taking from you </span>is simply <span class="gemarra-regular">the wheat that I am owed by you. </span>
The Gemara relates another story. <span class="gemarra-regular">Bar Kappar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said to the daughter of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, whose husband’s name was ben Elasa: <span class="gemarra-regular">Tomorrow I will drink wine at your father’s dancing and your mother’s singing [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kirekanei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Ben Elasa was the son-in-law of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">and was a very wealthy man. </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">invited him to the wedding of Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Bar Kappara said to Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi at the wedding: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the word <span class="gemarra-italic">to’eva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>abomination, used by the Torah to describe homosexual intercourse (see Leviticus 18:22)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Whatever </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>bar Kappara in explanation, claiming <span class="gemarra-regular">that this is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-italic">to’eva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, bar Kappara refuted </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>by proving otherwise. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You explain it. </span>Bar Kappara <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Let your wife come and pour me a goblet </span>of wine. <span class="gemarra-regular">She came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">poured him </span>wine. Bar Kappara then <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi: <span class="gemarra-regular">Arise </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">dance for me, so that I will tell you </span>the meaning of the word: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the Merciful One is saying </span>in the Torah in the word <span class="gemarra-italic">to’eva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: You are straying after it [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">to’e</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ata</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">bah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>i.e., after an atypical mate.
When they came <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>drink <span class="gemarra-regular">another cup,</span> bar Kappara <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What </span>is the meaning of the word <span class="gemarra-italic">tevel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>perversion, as in the verse: “Neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down thereto; it is perversion [<span class="it-text">tevel</span>]” (Leviticus 18:23)? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>various explanations <span class="gemarra-regular">to him, as </span>he did <span class="gemarra-regular">the previous </span>time, which were all refuted again by bar Kappara. Bar Kappara then <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Perform for me </span>as you did before, so <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will tell you. </span>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span>so. Bar Kappara then <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">“It is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tevel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">” </span>means: Does <span class="gemarra-regular">it have </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">spice [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tevalin</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">yesh</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">bah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]?

He is mentioned in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught: Ben Elasa did not dispense his money </span>on his special haircut <span class="gemarra-regular">for naught.

<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written </span>with regard to the priests: <span class="gemarra-regular">“They shall poll their heads” </span>(Ezekiel 44:20), and it is <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: This haircut is <span class="gemarra-regular">like a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">luleyanit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">luleyanit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?

The hair is cut in the form of hanks that do not overlap. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is the haircut of a High Priest, </span>for which ben Elasa paid a large sum. 
§ It is stated in the mishna that one who said: Cooked food is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, and for that reason I will not taste it, is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to </span>taste a <span class="it-text">turemita</span> egg <span class="gemarra-regular">and the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">remutza</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gourd. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">remutza</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> gourd</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Shmuel said: </span>A type of <span class="gemarra-regular">gourd </span>that grows in <span class="gemarra-regular">Karkuza [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kara</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">karkuzai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which does not cook well. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: A gourd that is insulated in embers [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">remetz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina raised an objection to </span>the definition given by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The halakha is that one who plants different types of vegetables in close proximity to each other violates, by rabbinic law, the transgression of diverse kinds (see <span class="it-text">Kilayim</span>). Concerning which types of gourd are considered to be different types, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Neḥemya says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an Aramean gourd is </span>identical to <span class="gemarra-regular">the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Egyptian gourd, </span>and one is permitted to plant them together. However, there is a prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds </span>when it is planted <span class="gemarra-regular">with the Greek </span>gourd, and there is a prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">diverse kinds </span>when it is planted <span class="gemarra-regular">with the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">remutza</span> gourd. This indicates that the <span class="it-text">remutza</span> gourd is a type of gourd rather than a gourd prepared in a certain manner. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation </span>of Rav Ashi’s opinion.
mishna In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that food <span class="gemarra-regular">cooked in a dish </span>is forbidden to him, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from </span>eating <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>food that is <span class="gemarra-regular">cooked by boiling </span>it in a dish, i.e., its main preparation is in a dish.

In the Rabbis’ local</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they call milk, milk and whey, whey, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">in Rabbi Yosei’s locale they also call whey, milk whey. </span>In the latter location, the word milk is used in reference to whey, and therefore one who vows there that milk is forbidden to him is prohibited from eating whey as well. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">milk </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to </span>partake of <span class="gemarra-regular">whey. </span>One who vows that <span class="gemarra-regular">whey </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to </span>partake of <span class="gemarra-regular">milk. </span>One who vows that <span class="gemarra-regular">milk </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to </span>eat <span class="gemarra-regular">cheese. </span>One who vows that <span class="gemarra-regular">cheese </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to </span>partake of <span class="gemarra-regular">milk. </span>One who vows that <span class="gemarra-regular">gravy </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to </span>eat <span class="gemarra-regular">sediments of boiled meat. </span>One who vows that <span class="gemarra-regular">sediments of boiled meat </span>are forbidden to him <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to </span>eat <span class="gemarra-regular">gravy. If </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: This </span>piece of <span class="gemarra-regular">meat is </span>hereby forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from eating <span class="gemarra-regular">it, and from its gravy, and from its sediments. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">One who vows: Wine </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>me, <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to </span>eat <span class="gemarra-regular">a cooked dish that has the flavor of wine. </span>However, if he <span class="gemarra-regular">said: This wine is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span><span class="gemarra-regular">will not taste </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">fell into a cooked dish, if </span>the dish <span class="gemarra-regular">contains </span>an amount of the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">that gives </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">flavor, it is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden. </span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">grapes </span>are forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to</span> partake of <span class="gemarra-regular">wine. </span>One who vows that <span class="gemarra-regular">olives </span>are forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span> him <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to </span>partake of <span class="gemarra-regular">oil. </span>However, if one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Olives and grapes are </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not taste these </span>items, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from tasting <span class="gemarra-regular">them and </span>the wine and oil <span class="gemarra-regular">that emerge from them.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the last ruling in the mishna, that one who vows: Olives and grapes are <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, and for that reason I will not taste these items, he is prohibited from tasting them and the wine and oil that emerge from them, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama raises a dilemma: </span>Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>because he said <span class="gemarra-regular">these</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he referred to specific olives or grapes, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>because he said: For <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">taste</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he referred not to eating but to tasting? 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If it enters your mind </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>because he said <span class="gemarra-regular">these, why do I </span>need the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">That I will not taste? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This teaches us that even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: That I will not taste, </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">if he said </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">these is he prohibited </span>from tasting oil or wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if </span>he did <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>say the word these, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>prohibited from doing so. The dilemma therefore cannot be resolved by inference from the phrasing of the vow in the mishna. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to this dilemma from the mishna below (57a): If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">This produce is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon me,</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to my mouth, he is prohibited from</span> eating <span class="gemarra-regular">their replacements and </span>anything that <span class="gemarra-regular">grows from them. </span>It may be inferred that liquids <span class="gemarra-regular">that emerge from them are permitted. </span>Evidently, referring to specific produce is not sufficient to render their juice forbidden. Rather, the prohibition in the mishna is apparently due to the phrase: And for that reason I will not taste.
The Gemara refutes this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">The same </span>ruling as in the mishna above <span class="gemarra-regular">is true </span>with regard to liquids <span class="gemarra-regular">that emerge from </span>the produce; they <span class="gemarra-regular">too are forbidden. And </span>the reason this ruling isn’t mentioned there is that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is preferable for </span>that mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">to teach us that their replacements are </span>forbidden just <span class="gemarra-regular">like what grows from them </span>is forbidden, although they contain no substance of the forbidden item.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution from the continuation of that same mishna: If one says: This produce is <span class="it-text">konam</span> upon me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">eat </span>them, or: This produce is <span class="it-text">konam</span> upon me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not taste </span>them, he <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to </span>eat <span class="gemarra-regular">their replacements and </span>anything that <span class="gemarra-regular">grows from them. </span>It may be inferred that liquids <span class="gemarra-regular">that emerge from them are forbidden. </span>The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>that mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">did not cite </span>liquids <span class="gemarra-regular">that emerge from them in the first clause, it did not cite </span>liquids <span class="gemarra-regular">that emerge from them in the latter clause either. </span>Therefore, it cannot be inferred that liquids that come from the produce are forbidden. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution from the previous mishna (52a): <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda said: </span>There was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident where Rabbi Tarfon prohibited me from </span>eating even <span class="gemarra-regular">eggs that were cooked with </span>meat. The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Indeed so, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>is this the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">When </span>the one who took the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">said: This meat is </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me, </span>referring to a specific piece of meat. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">something </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">and it gets mixed into another </span>food, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the latter food <span class="gemarra-regular">contains </span>an amount of the forbidden food <span class="gemarra-regular">that gives </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">flavor, </span>i.e., the prohibited food can be tasted in the permitted food, the mixture <span class="gemarra-regular">is forbidden. </span>Evidently, referring to a specific food causes what emerges from it to be forbidden as well. 
The Gemara reinterprets the dilemma: <span class="gemarra-regular">We do not raise the dilemma with regard to </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">these, as </span>using <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically this </span>word is certainly sufficient to render the liquids that come from the produce forbidden. <span class="gemarra-regular">When we raise a dilemma, it is with regard to </span>the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">That I will not taste </span>it. Is this phrase mentioned by the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>to teach that using it in a vow is sufficient to render the juice forbidden, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>mentioned <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>for that purpose? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution from the mishna above (51b): If one vows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Fish </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">fishes</span> are <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not taste </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is prohibited with regard to </span>all of <span class="gemarra-regular">them,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> whether large </span>fish <span class="gemarra-regular">or small, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">whether raw or cooked. But he is permitted </span>to taste <span class="gemarra-regular">minced sardines and </span>to taste <span class="gemarra-regular">fish brine. </span>The phrase: I will not taste, clearly does not render fish brine forbidden, although it contains that which emerged from fish. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: But </span>there is no evidence from here, as the fish brine that is permitted by the mishna may be referring to brine that <span class="gemarra-regular">already emerged from them </span>before the vow was taken, and was therefore not included in the fish that were rendered forbidden by the vow. The dilemma therefore remains unresolved. 

Daf 53a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">dates </span>are forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to </span>eat <span class="gemarra-regular">date honey</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> One who vows that <span class="gemarra-regular">late grape</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> are forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to </span>eat <span class="gemarra-regular">vinegar of late grapes. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>food <span class="gemarra-regular">that the name of its derivative is called after its </span>name, i.e., the liquid that emerges from it bears its name, e.g., date honey or vinegar of late grapes, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one vows </span>that the item itself, e.g., the grape, is forbidden to him, he is also <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from </span>consuming the liquid <span class="gemarra-regular">that emerges from it. But the Rabbis permit </span>this.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis is </span>identical to the statement of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> of the mishna, who rules that one who vows that dates are forbidden to him is permitted to eat date honey. What is the difference between them? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">There is </span>a difference <span class="gemarra-regular">between them </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taugh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said this principle: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anything that is commonly eaten </span>in its existing form, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">common to eat </span>the liquid <span class="gemarra-regular">that emerges from it, for example, dates and date honey, </span>if one <span class="gemarra-regular">vowed </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is forbidden to him, </span>he is also <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from consuming the liquid <span class="gemarra-regular">that emerges from it. </span>Similarly, if <span class="gemarra-regular">one vows </span>that the liquid <span class="gemarra-regular">that emerges from it </span>is forbidden to him, he is also <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from </span>partaking of <span class="gemarra-regular">it. </span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: Conversely, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anything that is not commonly eaten </span>as it is, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is common to eat </span>the liquid <span class="gemarra-regular">that emerges from it, </span>if one <span class="gemarra-regular">vowed </span>that he will not eat <span class="gemarra-regular">from it, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from </span>consuming <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>the liquid <span class="gemarra-regular">that emerges from it, as this </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">intended to </span>prohibit himself from eating <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>from the liquid <span class="gemarra-regular">that emerges from it. </span>The first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> does not distinguish between dates, which are commonly eaten in their original state, and late grapes, which are not. In both cases, he rules that the produce itself is forbidden and the derivative is permitted. By contrast, the Rabbis agree with Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar’s ruling with regard to produce that is not commonly eaten in its original state. They permit the produce itself and prohibit that which has emerged from it. Therefore, in the last case of the mishna, they permit eating the late grapes and prohibit eating their vinegar, whereas in the first case they prohibit both dates and date honey. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">wine </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>to partake of <span class="gemarra-regular">apple wine, </span>i.e., cider, as the unspecified term wine refers only to grape wine. One who vows that <span class="gemarra-regular">oil is </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to partake of <span class="gemarra-regular">sesame oil, </span>as the unspecified term oil refers only to olive oil. One who vows that <span class="gemarra-regular">honey </span>is forbidden to him is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">date honey, </span>as the unspecified term honey refers only to bee honey. 
One who vows that <span class="gemarra-regular">vinegar </span>is forbidden to him is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to partake of <span class="gemarra-regular">vinegar of late grapes, </span>as vinegar is typically made from wine. One who vows that <span class="gemarra-regular">leek</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> are forbidden to him is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to eat <span class="gemarra-italic">kaflutot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a type of leek. One who vows that <span class="gemarra-regular">vegetables </span>are forbidden to him is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to eat wild <span class="gemarra-regular">field vegetables, as this </span>type of vegetable has <span class="gemarra-regular">a modifie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> and is not referred to by the unspecified term vegetable.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">oil </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him, if he is <span class="gemarra-regular">in Eretz Yisrael </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to </span>eat <span class="gemarra-regular">sesame oil and </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from </span>eating <span class="gemarra-regular">olive oil, </span>as in Eretz Yisrael the unspecified term oil refers to olive oil. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if he took the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">in Babylonia, sesame oil </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>to him, as oil in Babylonia was generally made from sesame seeds, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>eat <span class="gemarra-regular">olive oil, </span>which was rarely used there. If he takes the vow in <span class="gemarra-regular">a locale where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>type of oil <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>type, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is prohibited from </span>eating both <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>type <span class="gemarra-regular">and that. </span>
The Gemara asks with regard to the last statement: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that he is prohibited from eating both types of oil? The statement seems superfluous. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is not superfluous. It is <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>only to teach that this is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> even <span class="gemarra-regular">where most </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">use </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>type of oil. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say: I should follow the majority </span>and permit the other kind of oil, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an uncertain </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition </span>is treated <span class="gemarra-regular">stringently. </span>Therefore, the other type is forbidden as well, as it is possibly included in the meaning of the vow, although it is used only by a minority of the residents.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">vegetables </span>are forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him, if he takes the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">during the </span>first six <span class="gemarra-regular">years of the seven-year </span>Sabbatical <span class="gemarra-regular">cycle, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from </span>eating <span class="gemarra-regular">garden vegetables and permitted to </span>eat <span class="gemarra-regular">field vegetables. But </span>if he takes the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">during the Sabbatical Year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from </span>eating <span class="gemarra-regular">field vegetables, </span>which are commonly eaten in the Sabbatical Year, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to </span>eat <span class="gemarra-regular">garden vegetables, </span>which are rarely consumed during that period, as it is prohibited to work the land. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abbahu said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel: </span>

Daf 53b

<span class="gemarra-regular">They taught </span>that if he takes the vow in the Sabbatical Year he is permitted to eat garden vegetables <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>if he is <span class="gemarra-regular">in a place where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">do not bring vegetables from outside </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">to Eretz </span>Yisrael. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, in a place where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">bring vegetables from outside </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz </span>Yisrael, where the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the Sabbatical Year do not apply, <span class="gemarra-regular">to Eretz </span>Yisrael, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from eating garden vegetables as well, as they are widely available, and therefore included in the unspecified word vegetable. 
The Gemara comments that this distinction is <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span> cited in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One may not bring vegetables from outside </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">to Eretz </span>Yisrael. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel says: One may bring vegetables from outside </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Eretz </span>Yisrael <span class="gemarra-regular">to Eretz </span>Yisrael. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason of the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one may not bring </span>vegetables from outside of Eretz Yisrael? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya said: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because a clod </span>of earth might be brought with the vegetables to Eretz Yisrael. Earth from outside of Eretz Yisrael is ritually impure, and bringing it to Eretz Yisrael would spread ritual impurity in the land.

Rabbi Yehuda say</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that if one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Pounded bean or </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥitta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will not <span class="gemarra-regular">taste </span>them, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to chew </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">raw, </span>as that is not the normal way to eat them, and therefore was not included in the intention of the vow. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught</span> in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says </span>that if one vows: <span class="gemarra-italic">Ḥitta</span> is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will not <span class="gemarra-regular">taste </span>it, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from </span>eating <span class="gemarra-regular">baked </span>wheat, i.e., baked wheat bread, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to chew </span>wheat grains.

Similarly, if one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Pounded bean </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will not <span class="gemarra-regular">taste </span>it,he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from cooking </span>pounded bean, i.e., from eating a dish of cooked pounded beans, as that is what the word pounded bean commonly means, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to chew </span>raw pounded beans. If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Pounded beans </span>are <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will not <span class="gemarra-regular">taste </span>them, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited from chewing</span> pounded beans <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to cook </span>them.

Daf 54a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> For <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">vegetables </span>are forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>eat <span class="gemarra-regular">gourds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as people typically do not include gourds in the category of vegetables; <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Akiva prohibits </span>him from eating gourds. The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rabbi Akiva: But doesn’t a person say to his agent: Purchase vegetables for me, and </span>the agent, after failing to find vegetables, returns with gourds and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: I found only gourds? </span>This indicates that gourds are not considered vegetables. 
Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: The matter is so, </span>and that proves my opinion; <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps, </span>does the agent return and <span class="gemarra-regular">say: I found only legumes? Rather, </span>it is apparent <span class="gemarra-regular">that gourds are included in </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">vegetables, </span>although they differ from other vegetables, and therefore, the agent purchases gourds and explains that he found only gourds. <span class="gemarra-regular">And legumes are not included in </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">vegetables, </span>and that is why the agent dispatched to purchase vegetables would not purchase legumes at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>for one who vows that vegetables are forbidden to him, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited to </span>eat <span class="gemarra-regular">the fresh cowpea</span>, which is considered a vegetable, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to </span>eat <span class="gemarra-regular">dry </span>cowpea, which is not a vegetable.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna: For <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">vegetables </span>are forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him, it is permitted to eat gourds, and Rabbi Akiva prohibits him from eating gourds. The Gemara questions Rabbi Akiva’s ruling: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>how can his vow include gourds, which are fruits and not vegetables; <span class="gemarra-regular">didn’t he vow </span>to refrain <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>eating <span class="gemarra-regular">vegetables</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said: </span>The mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who said: Vegetables </span>cooked <span class="gemarra-regular">in a pot </span>are forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me. </span>Gourds are included in the category of vegetables cooked in a pot. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if that is what he said, <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he is saying: A vegetable that is eaten in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., a vegetable that is added to flavor the food cooked in the pot, is forbidden to me? The Gemara answers: The mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who said: A vegetable that is cooked in a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">po</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me, </span>a statement that can include gourds.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to what </span>principle <span class="gemarra-regular">do </span>Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? </span>The Gemara explains that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis maintain: Any item with regard to which an agent must consult </span>the person who dispatched him before purchasing it, <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered the same <span class="gemarra-regular">type. </span>Since the agent must ask whether he can purchase gourds, apparently they are not a vegetable. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Akiva maintains: Any item with regard to which an agent </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">consul</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>considered the same <span class="gemarra-regular">type. </span>With regard to food of a different type, he does not consult. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Rabbi Akiva concedes with regard to lashes that </span>the one who vowed <span class="gemarra-regular">is not flogge</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> if he ate gourds, as the issue of whether or not he violated his vow is not entirely clear.
<span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>(<span class="it-text">Me’ila</span> 20a): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an agent who performed his missio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> properly, if he was tasked to use a particular item, and the one who dispatched him forgot that it was a consecrated item, <span class="gemarra-regular">the employer, </span>who dispatched him, <span class="gemarra-regular">misused </span>the consecrated item and is liable, as the agent acted on his behalf. However, if the agent <span class="gemarra-regular">did not perform his mission </span>properly, and the <span class="gemarra-regular">agent misused </span>the consecrated item, he is liable, as once the agent deviates from his mission, he ceases to be an agent and his actions are attributable to him. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is </span>the <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the mishna? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: The mishna </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as we learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>If the employer <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the agent: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give meat to the guests, and he gave them liver; </span>or if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">liver, and he gave them meat, the agent has misused </span>the consecrated item, as he deviated from his mission. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if </span>this were in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, didn’t Rabbi Akiva say: Any matter with regard to which an agent must consult is </span>considered the same <span class="gemarra-regular">type? </span>Since based on that criterion, liver is certainly considered meat, <span class="gemarra-regular">let the employer </span>be liable <span class="gemarra-regular">for misuse </span>of consecrated property <span class="gemarra-regular">and let the agent not </span>be liable <span class="gemarra-regular">for misuse </span>of consecrated property, as he fulfilled his mission. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>

Daf 54b

<span class="gemarra-regular">doesn’t Rabbi Akiva conced</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>the agent <span class="gemarra-regular">must consult </span>his employer? Because he failed to do so and acted on his own, he is not considered to have performed his mission. This <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated before Rava. He said to </span>those who stated the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> before him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Naḥmani</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., Abaye, <span class="gemarra-regular">spoke well.</span>
§ The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who disagrees with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Akiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> in the mishna here? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, as it is taught </span>in a dispute in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: For <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">meat </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">all types of meat, and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>for him to eat meat <span class="gemarra-regular">of the head, and of the feet, and of the windpipe, and of the liver, and of the heart, </span>although people do not typically eat meat from those parts of the body. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it is prohibited for him to eat meat <span class="gemarra-regular">of birds, </span>as it too is popularly called meat. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>for him to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">of the meat of fish and grasshoppers, </span>as their flesh is not called meat. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: One who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">meat</span> is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him, <span class="gemarra-regular">is forbidden in all types of meat, and is permitted </span>to eat meat <span class="gemarra-regular">of the head, and of the feet, and of the windpipe, and of the liver, and of the heart and of birds, and needless to say </span>he may also partake of <span class="gemarra-regular">fish and grasshoppers. And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel would likewise say: Innard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">meat, and one who eats them is not a person, </span>meaning that the innards are not fit for human consumption. The Gemara elaborates: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who eats them, </span>in terms of the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> related to their consumption, e.g., vows, they are considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as meat. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to purchase</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> one who purchases them <span class="gemarra-regular">is not a person. </span>In any case, apparently, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel disagrees with Rabbi Akiva, as he maintains that although if an agent fails to find meat he is required to consult his employer before replacing it with liver, it is not considered meat with regard to vows. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is different </span>about <span class="gemarra-regular">the meat of a bird according to the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, that he prohibits it </span>since it is considered meat, due to the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">the agent </span>fails to find meat, <span class="gemarra-regular">he tends to consult </span>his employer <span class="gemarra-regular">about it? </span>The same should be true of the <span class="gemarra-regular">meat of fish too</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If the agent does not find meat, he tends to consult </span>his employer <span class="gemarra-regular">about it, as he says: If I do not fin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> meat, should I bring fish? And </span>therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>fish also <span class="gemarra-regular">be forbidden </span>according to the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he let </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">bloo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> when he vowed, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>a person in that condition <span class="gemarra-regular">does not eat fish. </span>It was common knowledge then that eating fish after bloodletting is harmful. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, he </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">not eat birds either, as Shmuel said: </span>With regard to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who lets blood and eats the meat of a bird</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his heart </span>rate accelerates and <span class="gemarra-regular">flies like a bird</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Clearly, bird meat too is deleterious for his health. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One neither lets blood before </span>eating <span class="gemarra-regular">fish, nor before </span>eating <span class="gemarra-regular">birds, nor before </span>eating <span class="gemarra-regular">salted meat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And it is taught </span>in another <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">let blood, he may eat neither milk, nor cheese, nor eggs, nor cress</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nor birds, nor salted meat. </span>The Gemara answers: Meat of <span class="gemarra-regular">birds is different, as </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is possible </span>to eat it safely after bloodletting <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of </span>thoroughly <span class="gemarra-regular">boiling </span>it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>This is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where his eyes hurt him, as fish are harmful for eyes. </span>Therefore, meat of birds is permitted, but not fish. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, </span>and he is suffering from eye pain, he should <span class="gemarra-regular">eat fish, as Shmuel said </span>an acronym: <span class="gemarra-italic">Nun</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">samekh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ayin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which stands for: <span class="gemarra-italic">Nuna</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">samma</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">la’einayim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>which means: Fish is a medicine for eyes. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>statement of Shmuel is referring to the <span class="gemarra-regular">latter </span>stages <span class="gemarra-regular">of the </span>eye <span class="gemarra-regular">infection</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this to say that </span>according to Rabbi Meir, the term <span class="gemarra-italic">dagan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> means any </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">that is </span>harvested at one time and <span class="gemarra-regular">placed in a pile [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">midgan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef raised an objection: </span>After King Hezekiah called upon the people to give <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes properly, the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And as soon as the matter was publicized, the children of Israel gave in abundance the first fruits of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">dagan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, wine, and oil, </span>and honey, <span class="gemarra-regular">and of all the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tevua</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the field; </span>and the tithe of all that they brought <span class="gemarra-regular">in abundance” </span>(II Chronicles 31:5). <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-italic">dagan</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> means</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> any </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">that is placed in a pile, what is </span>the meaning of the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“As soon as the matter was publicized, </span>the children of Israel <span class="gemarra-regular">gave in abundance </span>the first fruits of <span class="it-text">dagan</span>…and of all the <span class="it-text">tevua</span> of the field”?

§ We learned in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: </span>For <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">grain</span> [<span class="gemarra-italic">tevua</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him, it is prohibited for him to eat from only the five species of grain. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Everyone concedes with regard to one who vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that <span class="gemarra-italic">tevua</span> is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>for him to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">from only the five species </span>of grain. The Rabbis do not disagree with Rabbi Meir in that regard. <span class="gemarra-regular">That is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And they agree with regard to one who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-italic">tevua</span> is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>for him to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">from only</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the five species </span>of grain. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious,</span> as it is only those species that are called <span class="it-text">tevua</span>. The Gemara answers: It is necessary; <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-italic">tevua</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> means all items </span>that grow from the ground, therefore, the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that </span>this expression <span class="gemarra-regular">does not mean all items </span>that grow from the ground. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef raised an objection: </span>With regard to the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“And as soon as the matter was publicized, the children of Israel </span>gave <span class="gemarra-regular">in abundance…</span>and of all the <span class="it-text">tevua</span> of the field,” the phrase “and of all the <span class="it-text">tevua</span> of the field” comes to include all crops that grow in the field. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Tevua</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is discrete </span>and refers to only the five species of grain, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tevua</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of the field is discrete </span>and refers to all crops that grow in the field.
§ The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">The son of Master Shmuel commanded </span>his workers <span class="gemarra-regular">that they give thirteen thousand dinars to Rava from the crop [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">alalta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>produced in his fields on the banks <span class="gemarra-regular">of the Panya River</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rava sent</span> this question <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Yosef: What is called </span><span class="gemarra-italic">alalta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> what crops are included in the category of <span class="it-text">alalta</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: It is </span>as it is taught in the <span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> cited above: <span class="gemarra-regular">And they agree with regard to one who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-italic">tevua</span> is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>for him to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">from only the five species </span>of grain; just as <span class="it-text">tevua</span> includes only the five species, so too <span class="it-text">alalta</span> includes only the five species. <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to </span>him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are </span>the two cases <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable? </span>Although <span class="gemarra-italic">tevua</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> means </span>grain and includes <span class="gemarra-regular">only the five species, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">alalta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> means </span>crop and includes <span class="gemarra-regular">all items </span>that grow. 
The messengers <span class="gemarra-regular">returned </span>with the answer to his question and came <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rava. He said: That was not a dilemma for me, </span>i.e., the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-italic">alalta</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> means all items </span>that grow. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is </span>the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">that is a dilemma for me: What is </span>the legal status of profits from the <span class="gemarra-regular">rent of houses and the rent of boats? Do we say: Since they depreciate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> their legal status is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>comparable to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a crop? </span>Only items that are consistently profitable are similar to crops. House boats deteriorate with use, and their depreciation diminishes the profits. <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps, since their depreciation is not conspicuous, </span>their legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>comparable to that of <span class="gemarra-regular">a crop. The Rabbis state</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> Rava’s reaction <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Yosef. </span>Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And since he does not need us, </span>and he believes that he knows the answer himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">why did he send us </span>the question? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef became angry </span>with Rava.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava heard </span>that Rav Yosef was angry <span class="gemarra-regular">and came before him on Yom Kippur ev</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> to appease him. <span class="gemarra-regular">He found the attendant of Rav Yosef, who was diluting a cup of wine </span>with water <span class="gemarra-regular">before him. </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>the attendant: <span class="gemarra-regular">Give me </span>the cup so <span class="gemarra-regular">that I will dilute </span>the wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for him. </span>The attendant <span class="gemarra-regular">gave </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to him and </span>Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">diluted the cup of wine. While </span>Rav Yosef, who was blind, <span class="gemarra-regular">was drinking </span>the wine, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: This dilution is similar to the dilution of Rava, son of Rav Yosef bar Ḥama, </span>who would dilute wine with more than the standard amount of water. Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Correct, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is he. </span>
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do not sit on your fee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until you tell me the explanation of this matter: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “And from the wildernes</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Mattana and from Mattana Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel Bamot” </span>(Numbers 21:18–19)? 
Rava <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>that it means: <span class="gemarra-regular">Once a person renders himself like a wilderness, deserted before all</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the Torah is given to him as a gift [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mattana</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], as it is stated: “And from the wilderness Mattana.” And once it is given to him as a gift, God bequeaths [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">naḥalo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> it to <span class="gemarra-regular">him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is stated: “And from Mattana Nahaliel.” And once God bequeaths </span>it to <span class="gemarra-regular">him, he rises to greatness, as it is stated: And from Nahaliel, Bamot, </span>which are elevated places. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he elevates himself </span>and is arrogant about his Torah, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One, Blessed be He, degrades him, as it is stated: “And from Bamot the valley” </span>(Numbers 21:20). <span class="gemarra-regular">And not only </span>is he degraded, <span class="gemarra-regular">but one lowers hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> into the ground, as it is stated: “And looking over [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nishkafa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the face of the wasteland” </span>(Numbers 21:20), like a threshold [<span class="it-text">iskopa</span>] that is sunken into the ground. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he reverses his </span>arrogance and becomes humble, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Holy One, Blessed be He, elevates him, </span>

Daf 55b

<span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Every valley shall be lifted” </span>(Isaiah 40:4). When Rav Yosef heard that interpretation, he understood that Rava was aware of the error of his ways in acting arrogantly toward his teacher, and was pacified by Rava’s display of humility.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: For <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">grain [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">dagan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited to </span>partake <span class="gemarra-regular">of the dry cowpea, and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>for him to partake <span class="gemarra-regular">of fresh </span>cowpea. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>for him to partake <span class="gemarra-regular">of rice</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as well as <span class="gemarra-regular">of wheat kernels split into two parts </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥilka</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of wheat kernels crushed into three parts [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">targeis</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and wheat kernels crushed into four parts [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">tisnei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> For <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">produce of the yea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited to </span>partake <span class="gemarra-regular">of all produce of the</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> year </span>that grew from the ground or on trees, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>for him to partake <span class="gemarra-regular">of goats, and of lambs,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and of milk, and of eggs, and of chicks </span>born that year, as they are not included in the category of produce. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if he said: Growths of the yea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me,</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited for him </span>to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">all of them. </span>
For <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">produce of the land </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>partake <span class="gemarra-regular">of all produce </span>that grow from <span class="gemarra-regular">the land, and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>for him to partake <span class="gemarra-regular">of truffles and mushroom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> that are not in the category of produce of the land. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he said: The growths of the ground are forbidden to me, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited for him</span> to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">all of them. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Berakhot</span> 40b): And <span class="gemarra-regular">over </span>a food <span class="gemarra-regular">item whose growth is not from the ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one recites: By Whose word all things came to be.

Even according to Abaye, mushrooms grow from the ground. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Emend </span>the mishna to read: <span class="gemarra-regular">Over </span>a food <span class="gemarra-regular">item that does not draw sustenance from the ground, </span>one recites: By Whose word all things came to be.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> For <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that a <span class="gemarra-regular">garment </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to </span>wear <span class="gemarra-regular">sackcloth, and to </span>wear <span class="gemarra-regular">a sheet, and to </span>wear <span class="gemarra-regular">a coarse curtain [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥamila</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as these are not in the category of garments. For one who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Wool is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me and I will therefore not <span class="gemarra-regular">place it upon myself, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">to cover himself with wool fleece, </span>which is not considered a garment, and it is prohibited for him to wear only a woolen fabric.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> For <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a house </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him, entry <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>for him <span class="gemarra-regular">in the upper stor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> of the house; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: An upper story is included </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the house, </span>and therefore, entry is prohibited there as well. However, for <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an upper story </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him, entry <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted in the house, </span>as the ground floor is not included in the upper story. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>with regard to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of leprosy that in the verse “it appears to me as it were a plague in the house” (Leviticus 14:35), the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“in the house” </span>comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to include the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">gallery</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a half story above the ground floor, and <span class="gemarra-regular">“in the house” </span>comes <span class="gemarra-regular">to include the upper story?

Ravina objects to </span>the question of the Rabbis: This anomaly is <span class="gemarra-regular">just as it is </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and wine, as </span>throughout <span class="gemarra-regular">the entire year if he wishes he eats </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if he wishes he does not eat </span>them; on <span class="gemarra-regular">that day </span>of the funeral, <span class="gemarra-regular">we give him </span>meat and wine in the meal of comfort. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, this</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is difficult, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> with regard to the custom of overturning the beds in the house of a mourner: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">dargash</span> in his house, the mourner <span class="gemarra-regular">would not overturn it, but </span>he merely <span class="gemarra-regular">stands i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> on its side. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say</span> that a <span class="it-text">dargash</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is a bed of fortune, isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: A mourner <span class="gemarra-regular">who </span>is required to <span class="gemarra-regular">overturn his be</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> is required to <span class="gemarra-regular">overturn not only his own bed, but</span> to <span class="gemarra-regular">overturn all of the beds that he has inside his house, </span>even those not used for sleeping. Why, then, is he not required to overturn the <span class="it-text">dargash</span>? The Gemara rejects this contention: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult; </span>

Daf 56b

this is <span class="gemarra-regular">just as it is </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the case <span class="gemarra-regular">of a bed designated </span>exclusively <span class="gemarra-regular">for vessels</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the bed in a mourner’s house <span class="gemarra-regular">was a bed designated for vessels </span>and not for sleeping, <span class="gemarra-regular">one need not overturn it. </span>The same is true with regard to the bed of fortune. Since it is not for sleeping, one need not overturn it.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, if </span>defining a <span class="it-text">dargash</span> as a bed of fortune <span class="gemarra-regular">is difficult, this is difficult, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: </span>A mourner need not overturn <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">dargash</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; </span>rather, he <span class="gemarra-regular">loosens </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">loops </span>that connect the straps that support the bedding to the bedframe, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it collapses on its own. And if a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">dargash</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is a bed of fortune, does it have loops [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">karvitin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> When Ravin came </span>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: I asked one of the Sages </span>about the meaning of <span class="it-text">dargash</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rav Taḥalifa, from the West, was his name, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">who frequented the tanners’ market.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> For <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the city </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to enter </span>the Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundary of </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">city,</span> the two-thousand-cubit area surrounding the city, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited to enter its </span><span class="gemarra-regular">outskirts</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the seventy-cubit area adjacent to the city. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">hous</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>to enter only <span class="gemarra-regular">from the doorstop and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">inward</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do we </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">that the </span>legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">the outskirts of a city are like that of the city </span>itself? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">as the verse states: “And it came to pass when Joshua was in Jericho, </span>that he lifted up his eyes and looked” (Joshua 5:13). <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">“in Jericho”? If we say </span>that it means <span class="gemarra-regular">in Jericho proper, isn’t it written: “And Jericho was completely shut” </span>(Joshua 6:1)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, learn from here </span>that Joshua was <span class="gemarra-regular">in the outskirts </span>of the city. And although he was in the outskirts, the verse states that he was in Jericho. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that the legal status of one located <span class="gemarra-regular">even in </span>the Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">boundary </span>of a city is like that of one inside the town itself, and perhaps although Joshua was merely within the Shabbat boundary, the verse characterizes him as being in Jericho. The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it written with regard to the boundary </span>of a city: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall measure outside the city…</span>two thousand cubits” (Numbers 35:5)? This indicates that the boundary of a city is considered outside the town and not part of the city itself. 
§ We learned in the mishna: For <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a house </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>him, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>to enter <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from the doorstop and inward. </span>The Gemara infers: <span class="gemarra-regular">However, from the doorstop outward</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> no, </span>it is permitted to enter. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mari raised an objection </span>based on a verse written with regard to leprosy: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the priest shall go out from the house </span>to the entrance of the house, and he shall quarantine the house” (Leviticus 14:38). And the question was raised in the halakhic midrash: One <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">may go to his house and quarantin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the leprous house that he examined from there. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “To the entrance of the house” </span>(Leviticus 14:38). <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>he may go only <span class="gemarra-regular">to the entrance of the house, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">he may stand beneath the linte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and quarantine </span>the house from there. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: </span>“And the priest shall go out <span class="gemarra-regular">from the house,” </span>indicating that he may not quarantine the house <span class="gemarra-regular">until he goes out from the entire house. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span><span class="it-text">Ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, the priest <span class="gemarra-regular">stands </span>outside, <span class="gemarra-regular">alongside the door jamb, and quarantines </span>the house. <span class="gemarra-regular">And from where </span>is it derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that if he went to his house and quarantined </span>the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">or stood beneath the lintel and quarantined </span>the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">that his quarantine is </span>an effective <span class="gemarra-regular">quarantine </span>after the fact? <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse states: “And he shall quarantine the house” </span>(Leviticus 14:38), which means <span class="gemarra-regular">in any case. </span>Apparently, the legal status of the area beneath the lintel is identical to the status inside the house, even if it is beyond the doorstop. The Gemara answers: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is different with regard to </span>a leprous <span class="gemarra-regular">house, as it is written: </span>“And the priest shall go out <span class="gemarra-regular">from the house,</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> indicating that he cannot quarantine the house <span class="gemarra-regular">until he goes out from the entire house. </span>

Since its growth exceeded its principal, </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">those permitted growths </span><span class="gemarra-regular">neutraliz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">the prohibition </span>of the onion, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>do they <span class="gemarra-regular">not? </span>Yishmael <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>and raised the dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Ami, and he did not have </span>an answer readily <span class="gemarra-regular">available. </span>
Yishmael <span class="gemarra-regular">came</span> and raised the dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">resolved </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for him from </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rabbi Ḥanina Terita’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yannai said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an onion of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">terum</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that one planted, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">its growths exceeded its principal, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">i</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Here too, the eighth-year growth should neutralize the prohibition of the Sabbatical-Year onion. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya said, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zerika </span>who said to Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa: <span class="gemarra-regular">Did the Master abandon </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">and conduct </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>Sage? 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who are they, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>Sages who disagree with his opinion? The Gemara answers: It is <span class="gemarra-regular">as Rabbi Abbahu said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a young </span>vine within three years of its planting, whose fruits are <span class="it-text">orla</span> and forbidden, <span class="gemarra-regular">that one grafte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> onto an old, </span>permitted vine, <span class="gemarra-regular">and there were fruits on </span>the younger vine, <span class="gemarra-regular">even though </span>the younger vine <span class="gemarra-regular">added two hundred </span>times the number of fruits that were there when it was grafted, and those additional fruits are permitted because they draw their nourishment from the older vine, the fruit that was on the younger vine before it was grafted is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden. </span>Although, in principle, when the permitted part of the mixture is two hundred times the forbidden <span class="it-text">orla</span>, the prohibition is neutralized, in this case, the prohibition is not neutralized, as the forbidden fruit was there from the outset. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Naḥmani said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an onion that one planted in a vineyard</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> creating a forbidden mixture of food crops in a vineyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the vineyard was uprooted, </span>and most of the onion grew in a permitted manner, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden. </span>Apparently, both Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yonatan disagree with the opinion of Rabbi Yannai, and therefore, there is no clear resolution to the dilemma.
Yishmael <span class="gemarra-regular">then came </span>and raised the dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rabbi Ami, who resolved </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for him from </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rabbi Yitzḥak said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">litr</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of onions that one tithed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>then he <span class="gemarra-regular">sowed </span>a field with the entire <span class="it-text">litra</span> of onions, when the field yields the crop, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is tithed according to the entire </span>crop. Although some of the onions that he sowed were already tithed, he is obligated to tithe them because the volume of the growths exceeds the volume of the original onions and the entire crop has untithed status. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, those growths neutralize the </span>prohibition of the <span class="gemarra-regular">primary, </span>original, tithed onions. 
The Gemara rejects that resolution: There is no proof from the ruling in the case of the <span class="it-text">litra</span> of onions, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">different </span>when the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is a stringency</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Perhaps, due to the concern that the growths neutralize the prohibition of the original, the ruling is that he must tithe the entire crop. However, there is no proof that the same would be true in cases where the ruling is a leniency, e.g., to neutralize the prohibition of the Sabbatical Year or <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>proof may be cited from <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>source; <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon says: </span>

Daf 58a

For <span class="gemarra-regular">any item that can become permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a forbidden object whose prohibition can or will lapse, <span class="gemarra-regular">for example, untithed produc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> that can be permitted through tithing, <span class="gemarra-regular">and second tithe </span>that is permitted through redemption or bringing it to Jerusalem (Deuteronomy 14:24–26), <span class="gemarra-regular">and consecrated items </span>that are also permitted through redemption, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>produce of the <span class="gemarra-regular">new </span>crop that is permitted after the sacrifice of the <span class="it-text">omer</span> offering (Leviticus 23:14), <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages did not determine a measure for their </span>neutralization, and no mixture with any quantity of permitted items neutralizes their prohibition. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">any item that cannot become permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for example, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the tithe, and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥalla</span> (Numbers 15:20–21); <span class="gemarra-regular">fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">orla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]; and forbidden food crops in a vineyard </span>(Deuteronomy 22:9), <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages determined a measure for their </span>neutralization. 
The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabbi Shimon: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t Sabbatical-Year </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">an item that cannot become permitted, and </span>nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages did not determine a measure for its </span>neutralization, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shevi’it</span> 7:7): <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sabbatical-Year </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibits </span>permitted produce <span class="gemarra-regular">of its </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">species </span>with which it is mixed <span class="gemarra-regular">in any amount</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Rabbi Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: I too said </span>that Sabbatical-Year produce prohibits permitted produce in a mixture and permitted growths that develop from it <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">remova</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> of the produce. Sabbatical-Year produce may be eaten only as long as produce of that species remains in the field, after which it must be removed from one’s possession. Since it is permitted to eat the produce before that time, its legal status during this period is that of an item that can become permitted. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the permissibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">eating </span>Sabbatical-Year produce after the time of removal has passed, when eating that produce is prohibited, the Sages determined a measure for their neutralization. The mixture is forbidden only if the measure of that produce is enough <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">impart flavor </span>to the mixture. Apparently, permitted growths can neutralize the prohibition of the original item. The Gemara rejects the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">And perhaps here too, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is different </span>when the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is a stringency</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In this case, the stringency is that the original item is sacred with the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year. However, here too, there is no proof that the same would be true in cases where the result is a leniency.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>Yishmael of Kefar Yamma <span class="gemarra-regular">resolved </span>his dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>source, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shevi’it</span> 6:3): With regard to sixth-year <span class="gemarra-regular">onions upon which rain fel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> during the Sabbatical Year, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they sprouted, if their leaves were black [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sheḥorin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., dark green, an indication of fresh, recent growth, the onions are <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>as Sabbatical-Year growth. If their leaves <span class="gemarra-regular">turned green [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">horiku</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., lighter and yellower, and appeared withered, the onions are <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted, </span>as they are considered a product of the sixth year. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says: </span>There is a different indicator; <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the plants <span class="gemarra-regular">can be uproote</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by their leaves, </span>clearly the leaves are fresh and recent, and they are <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden. And </span>in the <span class="gemarra-regular">parallel </span>situation, if that indicator was discovered in a Sabbatical-Year onion that sprouted <span class="gemarra-regular">at the conclusion of the Sabbatical Year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., during the eighth year, the onions are <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this to say that </span>one may conclude from here that <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted growth neutralizes the prohibition </span>of the original plant? The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">And perhaps </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to crushed [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">medukhanin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> pounded onions, and the reason that the prohibition of the original plant is neutralized is not that the permitted growth neutralizes the prohibition, but that it is no longer fit for consumption. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the dilemma can be resolved <span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>source; <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: 

Daf 58b

<span class="gemarra-regular">One who weeds </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥasayo</span><span class="gemarra-italic">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with a Samarita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may eat a casual meal from the</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span> without tithing, as any untithed produce may be eaten in the framework of a casual meal. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>when he completes the labor on the <span class="it-text">ḥasayot</span>, places them into a pile, and they require tithing, <span class="gemarra-regular">he tithes them </span>as produce that is <span class="gemarra-regular">definitely </span>obligated in tithing, not as doubtfully tithed produce, as the assumption is that the Samaritan did not tithe the <span class="it-text">ḥasayot</span>. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: If </span>the <span class="it-text">ḥasayot</span> belong to <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jew </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">suspect </span>about observance of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sabbatical Year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> at the conclusion of the Sabbatical Year </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> to weed with him, as there is no concern that there might be Sabbatical-Year sanctity. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this to say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the permitted growths </span>of the eighth year <span class="gemarra-regular">neutralize the prohibition, </span>and that is why there is no concern about Sabbatical-Year sanctity? The Gemara rejects that inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">And perhaps </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an item whose seeds ceas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> after it is sown, whose growths neutralize the original prohibition? The Gemara rejects that possibility: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">These are </span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥasayot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, for example, arum</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> garlic, and onions, </span>whose seeds do not cease? 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And perhaps </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>plants that were <span class="gemarra-regular">crushe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> before they sprouted growths? The Gemara answers: It is the case of one who is <span class="gemarra-regular">suspect about </span>observance of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sabbatical Year, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, and one who is suspect would not bother to eliminate the prohibition by crushing it. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And perhaps </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a mixture </span>of forbidden <span class="it-text">ḥasayot</span> and permitted ones, and the reason that it is permitted is that the prohibition was neutralized by the majority of permitted <span class="it-text">ḥasayot</span>? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who weeds, is taugh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, indicating that he is eating the leaves as he weeds them, leaving no opportunity for the <span class="it-text">ḥasayot</span> to be mixed with others.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that this is a conclusive refutation </span>of the opinions <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yonatan, </span>who stated regarding <span class="it-text">orla</span> and food crops in a vineyard that their permitted growth does not neutralize the prohibition of the original fruit or food crops respectively. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">Sabbatical-Year </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">is different. Since its prohibition </span>is engendered <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of the ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its nullification is </span>effected <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of the ground as well. </span>The prohibition can be neutralized by means of the growth that results from replanting the forbidden plant in a permitted manner. 
The Gemara asks: Isn’t there the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe, whose prohibition is </span>engendered <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of the ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but its nullification is not </span>effected <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of the ground? As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">litra</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of untithed </span>first <span class="gemarra-regular">tith</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> from which the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe was not taken, <span class="gemarra-regular">which one sowed in the ground, and it grew and it is </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">approximately ten </span><span class="gemarra-italic">litra</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>that additional growth <span class="gemarra-regular">is obligated </span>to have <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe </span>taken <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>is subject to the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of Sabbatical-Year </span>produce. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>original <span class="gemarra-italic">litra</span> of untithed first tithe that he sowed, one <span class="gemarra-regular">tithes for it from </span>produce in <span class="gemarra-regular">a different place</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and not from the <span class="it-text">litra</span> itself, <span class="gemarra-regular">based on a calculation </span>of how much <span class="it-text">teruma</span> of the tithe needed to be taken from that litra. Apparently, the growth that results from sowing the first tithe in the ground does not neutralize its prohibition. 

Daf 59a

The Sages of the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">tithe, </span>the ground does not engender the obligation; <span class="gemarra-regular">placement </span>of the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">in a pile engenders </span>the obligation, as it is only at that point that one is obligated to tithe his produce. Therefore neutralization of the prohibition is not effected by planting it in the ground. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama raised an objection </span>to the opinion of Rabbi Yannai based on the mishna (57a): For one who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">This produce is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kona</span><span class="gemarra-italic">m</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">upon me, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon my mouth, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to my mouth, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>to partake of the produce, or <span class="gemarra-regular">of its replacements, or </span>of anything that <span class="gemarra-regular">grows from</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it. </span>If he says: This produce is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will not <span class="gemarra-regular">eat </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will not <span class="gemarra-regular">taste </span>it, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted </span>for him to partake <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its replacements or </span>of anything that <span class="gemarra-regular">grows from it. </span>This applies only <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to an item whose seeds cease </span>after it is sown. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, with regard to an item whose seeds do not cease </span>after it is sown, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>for him to partake even of the <span class="gemarra-regular">growths of </span>its <span class="gemarra-regular">growths. </span>Apparently, permitted growths do not neutralize the prohibition. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Konamot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are different; since if he wishes </span>to do so he can <span class="gemarra-regular">request </span>that a halakhic authority dissolve the vows and render the objects of the vows permitted, <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>legal status <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">an item that can become permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>its prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">is not nullified by a majority </span>of permitted items. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>isn’t there the case of <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">which if </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes </span>he can <span class="gemarra-regular">request </span>that a halakhic authority dissolve the designation of the produce as <span class="it-text">terum</span><span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet it is <span class="gemarra-regular">nullified by a majorit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> of permitted items? <span class="gemarra-regular">As we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Terumot</span> 5:1): <span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of ritually impure </span><span class="gemarra-italic">terum</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that fell into less than one hundred </span><span class="it-text">se’a</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred produce </span>must be left <span class="gemarra-regular">to decay</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The impure <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, which is forbidden to all, renders the entire mixture forbidden. The Gemara infers: If it fell <span class="gemarra-regular">into one hundred </span><span class="it-text">se’a</span> of non-sacred produce, its prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">is neutralized</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Sages of the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">We are dealing with </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> that is <span class="gemarra-regular">in the possession of a priest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">which </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">can no </span>longer <span class="gemarra-regular">request </span>that a halakhic authority dissolve the designation. However, as long as the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> is in the owner’s possession he can request that its designation be dissolved, and therefore its prohibition cannot be neutralized. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, say the latter clause </span>of that mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> mixed with the non-sacred produce <span class="gemarra-regular">was ritually pure, </span>it may <span class="gemarra-regular">be sold to a priest, </span>who treats all the produce as though it were <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. This indicates that the mishna is dealing with <span class="it-text">teruma</span> in its owner’s possession that was not yet given to a priest. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, we are dealing with </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an Israelite who inherited </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>a member of <span class="gemarra-regular">the house of his mother’s father, </span>who is <span class="gemarra-regular">a priest. </span>The heir owns the <span class="it-text">teruma</span>; however, since he was not the one who designated it as <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, he may not request that the designation be dissolved. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught in </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">latter clause </span>of that mishna: It must <span class="gemarra-regular">be sold to a priest; </span>however, the price must reflect the value of the entire mixture <span class="gemarra-regular">except for the value of that </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> of <span class="it-text">teruma</span> that fell into the non-sacred produce, as the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> belongs to the priest. If the mishna is referring to the case of an heir who owns the <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, why can he not collect the value of that <span class="it-text">se’a</span> as well, as it is his property?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say </span>that there is another distinction between <span class="it-text">konamot</span> and other cases where one may request dissolution by a halakhic authority. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-italic">konamot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a mitzva to request </span>that a halakhic authority dissolve <span class="gemarra-regular">them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> due to </span>the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Natan, as</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Natan said: Anyone who vows, it is as if he built </span>a personal <span class="gemarra-regular">altar </span>outside the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who fulfills </span>that vow, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">as though he burns </span>an offering <span class="gemarra-regular">upon it. </span>However, in the case of <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, what mitzva </span>is there <span class="gemarra-regular">to request </span>that a halakhic authority dissolve <span class="gemarra-regular">its </span>designation? Therefore, items forbidden by <span class="it-text">konamot</span> are considered items that can become permitted, and <span class="it-text">teruma</span> is not.
§ With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">litra</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of onions that one tithed, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">sowed, it is tithed according to the entire </span>crop. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba sat and stated this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rav Ḥisda said to him: Who listens to you and Rabbi Yoḥanan, your teacher</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> The permitted part of </span>the <span class="it-text">litra</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">to where did it go</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The original <span class="it-text">litra</span> that he sowed was permitted by virtue of the fact that he tithed it, but why is he obligated to tithe the entire crop? The original <span class="it-text">litra</span> should be subtracted from the crop that must be tithed. Rabba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rav Ḥisda: <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn a corresponding </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Shevi’it</span> 6:3): With regard to sixth-year <span class="gemarra-regular">onions upon which rain fell </span>during the Sabbatical Year, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they sprouted, </span>

Daf 59b

<span class="gemarra-regular">if their leaves were black</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the onions are <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden. </span>If their leaves <span class="gemarra-regular">turned green, </span>the onions are <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted. And if </span>the leaves <span class="gemarra-regular">are black, why </span>are the onions <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden? Let us say </span>in this case too: <span class="gemarra-regular">The permitted part, </span>the original onion, <span class="gemarra-regular">to where did it go? </span>Rav Ḥisda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>Rabba: <span class="gemarra-regular">Do you maintain </span>that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught about the primary, </span>original onion, that it is prohibited? It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught with regard to the additional </span>growth that sprouted, and it is those leaves that <span class="gemarra-regular">are forbidden. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, what is Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, </span>who apparently disagrees with the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">coming to say? As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: That which grew during </span>a period of <span class="gemarra-regular">liability is liabl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and is considered Sabbatical-Year produce, and that <span class="gemarra-regular">which grew during </span>a period of <span class="gemarra-regular">exemption is exempt. </span>According to Rav Ḥisda’s explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>cited in the mishna, <span class="gemarra-regular">also said that. </span>
The Gemara explains: This is not difficult, as this <span class="gemarra-regular">entire mishna, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel taught it. </span>In the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel is not disagreeing with the opinion of the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna; he is merely restating it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>nevertheless, the mishna and the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> pose no difficulty with regard to the opinion of Rabba, as <span class="gemarra-regular">you heard that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel </span>said that the prohibition of the primary, original part is not neutralized <span class="gemarra-regular">onl</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not exert </span>himself, and the leaves sprouted on their own. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>in the case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he exerted </span>himself, e.g., by sowing or planting, the prohibition of the original onions is <span class="gemarra-regular">neutralized by the majority. </span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And anywhere that one exerts </span>himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the original part <span class="gemarra-regular">nullified by the majority? </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>isn’t there the case of one who sowed <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">litra</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of untithed tithe, </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">he exerts </span>himself to sow it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is taught: And that </span>original <span class="gemarra-italic">litra</span> of untithed first tithe that he sowed, one <span class="gemarra-regular">proportionally tithes for it from </span>produce in <span class="gemarra-regular">a different place, </span>and its prohibition is not neutralized by the growth. The Gemara answers: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is different with regard to tithe, as the verse states: “You shall tith</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> all the produce of your seed that is brought forth in the field” (Deuteronomy 14:22), indicating that all permitted seeds that are sown must be tithed, since <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>seeds that were tithed, <span class="gemarra-regular">people </span>typically <span class="gemarra-regular">sow. Forbidden </span>seeds that were not tithed, <span class="gemarra-regular">people do not </span>typically <span class="gemarra-regular">sow, </span>but the Sages penalized one who sowed untithed seeds and required him to tithe that which he was originally obligated to tithe and decreed that it is not neutralized by the majority.
§ With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span>matter <span class="gemarra-regular">itself, Rabbi Ḥanina Tirta’a said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yannai said: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">an onion of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that one planted, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">its growths exceeded its principal, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this to say that growths </span>that are 

Daf 60a

<span class="gemarra-regular">permitted neutralize the prohibition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The growths of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> indicating that they do not neutralize the prohibition of the original part of the plant? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">We are speaking of the growths of growths</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>Rabbi Yannai permits the <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, not due to the majority of direct growths of <span class="it-text">teruma</span>; he permitted it due to the majority of growths that sprouted from its growths. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">We </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learned that too</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> The </span>status of <span class="gemarra-regular">growths of growths </span>of <span class="it-text">teruma</span> is that of <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred </span>produce. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This teaches us </span>that the growths of growths are permitted <span class="gemarra-regular">even in items whose seeds do not cease, </span>e.g., onions. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">untithed produce, its growths are permitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in items whose seeds cease; however, </span>concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">items whose seeds do not cease, the growths of growths are forbidden. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It teaches us that </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the increase of the growths </span>of growths <span class="gemarra-regular">exceede</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> its primary, </span>original part, that original part is <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted.</span>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one vows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wine is </span>forbidden to me <span class="gemarra-regular">as if </span>it were <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will not <span class="gemarra-regular">taste </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">today</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from drinking wine <span class="gemarra-regular">only until </span>the conclusion of that day at <span class="gemarra-regular">nightfall, </span>and not for a twenty-four hour period. If one vows not to drink wine <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">week</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from drinking wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for the entire </span>remainder of the <span class="gemarra-regular">week. And </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat </span>is considered part of the week <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span><span class="gemarra-regular">passed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., it is the end of the week, he is prohibited from drinking wine on the upcoming Shabbat. If one vows not to drink wine <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="gemarra-regular">month</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> wine is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">for the entire </span>remainder of the <span class="gemarra-regular">month; and </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">the New Moon </span>of the following month is considered part <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">the next </span>month, he is permitted to drink wine on that day.
If he vowed not to drink wine <span class="gemarra-regular">this year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from drinking wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for the entire </span>remainder of the <span class="gemarra-regular">year; and </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rosh HaShana </span>is considered to be part <span class="gemarra-regular">of the upcoming </span>year, not the current one, he is permitted to drink wine on that day. If he vowed not to drink wine during <span class="gemarra-regular">this seven-year </span>Sabbatical cycle, wine is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">for the entire </span>remainder of the <span class="gemarra-regular">seven-year </span>cycle; <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sabbatical </span>Year is considered part of the cycle <span class="gemarra-regular">that passed, </span>he is prohibited from drinking wine during the upcoming Sabbatical Year. 
All this applies if he said that he would not drink wine on this day or this week, <span class="gemarra-regular">but if he said </span>that wine is forbidden to him for <span class="gemarra-regular">one day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">one week, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">one month, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">one year, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">one seven-year </span>cycle, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from drinking wine <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">day </span>and time he took the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the same time the next <span class="gemarra-regular">day, </span>or week, etc. 
If he takes a vow that wine is forbidden to him <span class="gemarra-regular">until Passover</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is forbidden </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>Passover <span class="gemarra-regular">arrives. </span>If he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Until it will be </span>Passover, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is forbidden </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>Passover <span class="gemarra-regular">ends, </span>as he may have intended for the vow to apply as long as it was still Passover (Rosh). If he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Until before Passover</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Meir says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>Passover <span class="gemarra-regular">arrives. Rabbi Yosei says: It is forbidden </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">until it ends.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna that if one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wine is </span>forbidden to me <span class="gemarra-regular">as if </span>it were <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will not <span class="gemarra-regular">taste </span>it today, he is prohibited from drinking wine only until nightfall. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya said: </span>Even <span class="gemarra-regular">when darkness falls </span>he is not permitted to drink wine immediately; rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is required </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">request </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a halakhic authority </span>dissolve his vow. 
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that he must request the dissolution of the vow once it has already expired? The Gemara answers that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>The Sages issued a rabbinic <span class="gemarra-regular">decree </span>in the case of one who said that his vow applies <span class="gemarra-regular">today, due to </span>the confusion that might be caused in a case where one said that his vow applies for <span class="gemarra-regular">one day, </span>and is therefore forbidden to drink wine for twenty-four hours. There is a concern that if one who said that his vow applies today is permitted to drink wine that night, one who took a vow for one day will think that his vow also expires as soon as it is nightfall. 

Daf 60b

Abaye <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: If so, </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">should </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">decree in the case of </span>one who takes a vow for <span class="gemarra-regular">one day </span>that he must keep the vow until nightfall of the following day, <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>the confusion that might be caused in a case where one said that his vow applies <span class="gemarra-regular">today. </span>If the vow expires in the middle of the day, twenty-four hours after he took the vow, people might think that if one takes a vow in the morning and applies it to this day, it also expires in the middle of the day. 
Rav Yosef <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>A vow taken for <span class="gemarra-regular">this day </span>might be <span class="gemarra-regular">interchanged with </span>a vow taken for <span class="gemarra-regular">one day, </span>and one might erroneously conclude that a vow taken for one day expires at nightfall. However, a vow taken for <span class="gemarra-regular">one day </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not interchanged </span>with a vow taken for <span class="gemarra-regular">today, </span>and there is no concern that one who takes a vow for today will erroneously conclude that it expires in the middle of the day. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: Mareimar said to me: Your father said as follows, in the name of Rav Yosef: In accordance with whose </span>opinion is this <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> taught <span class="gemarra-regular">by Rav Yirmeya bar Abba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan says: Anyone who vows, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">as if he </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">built </span>a personal <span class="gemarra-regular">altar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which is forbidden because one must bring all offerings to the Temple. <span class="gemarra-regular">And one who fulfills </span>the vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">is as though he burns </span>portions meant for the altar in the Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">upon it, </span>i.e., the personal altar, thereby increasing his sin. Consequently, even after he has fulfilled the vow, it is preferable for him to ask a halakhic authority to annul it entirely, so that it will be as if he never took a vow.
§ The mishna stated that one who says: Wine is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, and for that reason I will not taste it <span class="gemarra-regular">this week, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from drinking wine <span class="gemarra-regular">for the entire </span>remainder of the <span class="gemarra-regular">week, </span>including Shabbat. The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious </span>that this is the case? The Gemara answers: It is necessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he said the days of the week, </span>i.e., he meant for his vow to apply only on the weekdays. The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the phrase this week includes Shabbat.
The mishna stated: If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">This month, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">for the entire </span>remainder of the <span class="gemarra-regular">month, and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">New Moon </span>is considered part <span class="gemarra-regular">of the next </span>month. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">obvious? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">When it was necessary </span>to teach this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> it was <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>a New Moon preceding <span class="gemarra-regular">a deficient, </span>twenty-nine-day <span class="gemarra-regular">month</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In such a case the New Moon is celebrated for two days, the first of which is the thirtieth day of the previous month and the second of which is the first day of the new month. The case here is one where he took the vow on the first day of the New Moon. 
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that the first day of <span class="gemarra-regular">the New Moon is </span>part <span class="gemarra-regular">of the previous </span>month, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore the vow should expire at the end of that day, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>wine <span class="gemarra-regular">should not be forbidden </span>to him during the upcoming month. The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that since <span class="gemarra-regular">people call it the New Moo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of the upcoming month, it is viewed as part of the upcoming month, and the vow applies to the new month. 
§ The mishna states that if one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">This year, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">for the entire </span>remainder of the <span class="gemarra-regular">year, </span>and that Rosh HaShana is considered part of the upcoming year. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the scholars: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Wine is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will not <span class="gemarra-regular">taste </span>it for <span class="gemarra-regular">a day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> in <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>case? Is it considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as</span> though he said <span class="gemarra-regular">today, </span>and he is prohibited from consuming wine until nightfall, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>is it considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>though he said <span class="gemarra-regular">one day, </span>in which case the vow takes effect for a period of twenty-four hours? 
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a proof <span class="gemarra-regular">from the mishna: </span>If one says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wine is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam </span>for me<span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will not <span class="gemarra-regular">taste </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">today, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from drinking wine <span class="gemarra-regular">only until </span>the conclusion of that day, at <span class="gemarra-regular">nightfall. </span>The Gemara infers that this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> only applies if he said the word today; <span class="gemarra-regular">therefore, </span>if he said the vow applies for <span class="gemarra-regular">a day, </span>it is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable </span>to a case where he said <span class="gemarra-regular">one day, </span>and the vow is in effect for twenty-four hours.
The Gemara rejects this proof: But <span class="gemarra-regular">say the latter clause </span>of the mishna: If <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span>that wine is forbidden to him for <span class="gemarra-regular">one day, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from drinking wine <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">day </span>he took the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>the same time on the following <span class="gemarra-regular">day. </span>This indicates that it is only if he said: One day, that the vow takes effect for twenty-four hours; <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>if he said it takes effect for <span class="gemarra-regular">a day, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable </span>to a case where he said <span class="gemarra-regular">today, </span>and the vow takes effect only until nightfall. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, no </span>inference is <span class="gemarra-regular">to be learned from this </span>mishna. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to this question from the following mishna (63a): If one vowed: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wine is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, and for that reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will not <span class="gemarra-regular">taste </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">this year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> then </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">the year was extended, </span>i.e., declared to be a leap year, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from drinking wine <span class="gemarra-regular">in it and its intercalated </span>month. The Gemara inquires: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances? </span>

Daf 61a

<span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that it is exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">as it teaches, why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">to state </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? It is obvious that a year means that entire year, even if it is a leap year. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>he did not say that the vow applies this year, but rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span>that it applies for <span class="gemarra-regular">a year, </span>and the mishna teaches that the vow applies for the remainder of that year? <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>saying that a vow applies for <span class="gemarra-regular">a year </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable to </span>saying it applies <span class="gemarra-regular">this year; and </span>similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> in a case where one accepts a vow for <span class="gemarra-regular">a day </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">also be like </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in a case where one accepts a vow for <span class="gemarra-regular">today.</span>
The Gemara refutes this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, actually, </span>the case in the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">that he said </span>his vow should apply <span class="gemarra-regular">this year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>it was necessary to state this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say: Follow the majority of years, which do not have an intercalated </span>month, and his vow should be understood as referring to a twelve month period. The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that the phrase this year means that the vow should last until the end of the year. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: If one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>Any <span class="gemarra-regular">wine that I taste </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">a Jubile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> is hereby forbidden to me, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is <span class="gemarra-regular">the fiftieth year </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as before fifty, </span>i.e., is it included in the vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>is it considered <span class="gemarra-regular">as after fifty, </span>in which case it is not included in the vow?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that there is <span class="gemarra-regular">a dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis: </span>The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall sanctify the fiftieth year” </span>(Leviticus 25:10), from which it is derived: <span class="gemarra-regular">You count </span>it as <span class="gemarra-regular">the fiftieth year, </span>i.e., the Jubilee Year, <span class="gemarra-regular">but you do not count </span>it as both the <span class="gemarra-regular">fiftieth year and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>year of the next Sabbatical and Jubilee cycles. <span class="gemarra-regular">From here they stated: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">Jubilee Year is not include</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the counting of the seven-year </span>cycle of the Sabbatical Year. Rather, the year following the Jubilee Year is considered the first year of the next seven-year cycle. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: The Jubilee Year is included in the counting of the </span>following <span class="gemarra-regular">seven-year </span>cycle of the Sabbatical Year. 
The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to Rabbi Yehuda: Doesn’t </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">state: “Six years you shall sow your field” </span>(Leviticus 25:3)? <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according to your opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">there are only five </span>years <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>in the Sabbatical cycle following the Jubilee Year, as the first year would be the Jubilee Year, when it is forbidden to sow one’s field. 
Rabbi Yehuda <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: </span>There is a difficulty <span class="gemarra-regular">according to your statement </span>as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">Doesn’t </span>the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">state: “And it shall bring forth produce for the three years” </span>(Leviticus 25:21)? The Torah promises the Jewish people that in the year preceding the Sabbatical Year, the land will bring forth enough produce to last for the duration of that year, for the Sabbatical Year, and for part of the following year, until the new produce grows. However, in the case of the Jubilee, <span class="gemarra-regular">there are four </span>years to account for, as agricultural labor is prohibited in the forty-ninth year, which is a Sabbatical Year, and in the following year, which is the Jubilee Year. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>you must say that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is possible to establish </span>the verse as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the other years of seven-year </span>cycles, i.e., other Sabbatical Years apart from the Sabbatical Year right before the Jubilee Year. With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">my </span>opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">also, it is possible to establish </span>the verse you presented as a difficulty as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to the other years of seven-year </span>cycles, i.e., other Sabbatical cycles apart from the cycle immediately following the Jubilee. With regard to the dilemma cited previously, according to the Rabbis, just as the Jubilee Year does not count as part of the ensuing Jubilee cycle because it is considered the end of the previous Jubilee cycle, if one takes a vow and states that it applies for the Jubilee cycle, the Jubilee Year is included in the vow. According to Rabbi Yehuda, the Jubilee Year itself actually begins the next Jubilee cycle, and therefore if one takes a vow for the current Jubilee cycle, the Jubilee Year itself is not included.
§ It was taught in the mishna that if one vows that wine is forbidden to him <span class="gemarra-regular">until Passover, </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from drinking wine until the Festival arrives. However, if one vows that wine is forbidden to him  until before Passover, there is a dispute as to whether the vow remains in effect until the beginning or the end of the Festival. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this to say that Rabbi Meir, </span>who holds that it is prohibited only until the beginning of Passover, <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person does not place himself </span>

Daf 61b

<span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a position of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty, and Rabbi Yosei holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person does place himself in </span>a position of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span>
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from the following mishna (<span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 64b): In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who has two groups </span>of two <span class="gemarra-regular">daughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> born to him <span class="gemarra-regular">from two women, </span>e.g., he has two daughters from his first wife, and after his first wife died he remarried and had two daughters with his second wife, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he said: I betrothed my older daughter </span>to someone, <span class="gemarra-regular">but I do not know if </span>I meant the <span class="gemarra-regular">older of the older </span>group of daughters; or <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>I meant <span class="gemarra-regular">the older </span>daughter <span class="gemarra-regular">of the younger </span>group; <span class="gemarra-regular">or if </span>I meant the <span class="gemarra-regular">younger </span>daughter <span class="gemarra-regular">of the older </span>group, <span class="gemarra-regular">who is </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">older than the older </span>daughter <span class="gemarra-regular">of the younger </span>group, then <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>three of those daughters <span class="gemarra-regular">are prohibited </span>to marry another man due to the uncertainty, as he failed to clarify which daughter was betrothed. This applies to all the daughters <span class="gemarra-regular">apart from the younger </span>daughter <span class="gemarra-regular">of the younger </span>group, who is certainly not betrothed. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: They are all permitted </span>to marry, <span class="gemarra-regular">apart from the older </span>daughter <span class="gemarra-regular">of the older </span>group. This demonstrates that according to Rabbi Meir, one must take into account any of the possible meanings of the imprecise expression: My older daughter, whereas Rabbi Yosei maintains that only the narrowest possible meaning of the phrase is taken into account. This contradicts the mishna here. 
In response to this question, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina bar Avdimi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: The </span>attribution of the <span class="gemarra-regular">opinions is reversed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the views stated in the mishna here must be reversed in order to reconcile them with the mishna in <span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the principle: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>vow which specifies <span class="gemarra-regular">a fixed time, </span>i.e., an event that occurs on a particular date, and one <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that the vow applies <span class="gemarra-regular">until before </span>that event, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says </span>the vow applies <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the event <span class="gemarra-regular">ends, and Rabbi Yosei says </span>that the vow is in effect only <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the event <span class="gemarra-regular">arrives. </span>This is another proof that the opinions in the mishna here must be reversed.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one takes a vow that something is forbidden to him <span class="gemarra-regular">until the grain </span><span class="gemarra-regular">harvest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or <span class="gemarra-regular">until the grape harvest, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">until the olive harvest, it is forbidden </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">only until the arrival </span>of that season. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the principle: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>occasion <span class="gemarra-regular">whose time is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">fixed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and one said: Until it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">arrives, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the specified occasion <span class="gemarra-regular">arrives. </span>If he <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Until it will be, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the specified occasion <span class="gemarra-regular">ends. And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>occasion <span class="gemarra-regular">whose time is not fixed, </span>i.e., it does not fall on a precise date, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether he said: Until it will be, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Until it arrives, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">only until </span>the specified occasion <span class="gemarra-regular">arrives.</span>
If he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Until the summer [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kayitz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Until it will be summer, </span>the vow remains in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">until the people begin to bring </span>fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">into </span>their houses <span class="gemarra-regular">in baskets</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Until the summer has passed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the vow remains in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the people <span class="gemarra-regular">set aside </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yakpilu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the knives </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">hamaktzuot</span>] with which the figs are cut after being harvested, and return them to their place of storage. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">baske</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> about which <span class="gemarra-regular">they spoke </span>in the mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">a basket of figs, and not a basket of grapes, </span>which are gathered later than figs. It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">summer [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kayitz</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">produce </span>is forbidden<span class="gemarra-regular"> to </span>him<span class="gemarra-regular"> is prohibited </span>from partaking <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">figs, </span>as the fig harvest is called <span class="it-text">kayitz</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Grapes are included </span>in the category of the summer produce, along <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span><span class="gemarra-regular">figs</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason of the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Gemara answers: He <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that since <span class="gemarra-regular">figs are plucked [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">mikkatzetzan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] by hand, </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">grapes are plucked not by hand </span>but with tools, it is only figs that are considered summer [<span class="it-text">kayitz</span>] produce. Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">grapes, too, when they are </span>sufficiently <span class="gemarra-regular">ripe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are plucked by hand. </span>Therefore, they can be considered summer produce as well.
§ The mishna states that if one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Until the summer has passed, </span>then the vow remains in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the people <span class="gemarra-regular">set aside the knives </span>used to cut the figs. It was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span>This means <span class="gemarra-regular">until most </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">set aside </span>their <span class="gemarra-regular">knives, </span>even if there are still some individuals who have yet to do so. 

Daf 62a

The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">most of the knives have been set aside, </span>the figs left in the field <span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted with regard to </span>the laws of <span class="gemarra-regular">stealing and are exempt from tithes, </span>since their owners presumably do not want them and the figs are therefore considered ownerless property.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda arrived at a certain place at a time when most of the knives had been set aside. Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">ate </span>the figs left in the field, but <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda did not eat. The owner </span>of the field <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to them: Why are the Sages not eating? It is </span>now the period when <span class="gemarra-regular">most of the knives have been set aside. </span>The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">But nevertheless, Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda did not eat, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">he thought </span>that it was only <span class="gemarra-regular">due to embarrassment over the matte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">that man said </span>his comment, but he did not really mean to declare his figs ownerless.
The Gemara relates another incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥama bar Rabbi Ḥanina arrived at a certain place at a time when most of the knives had been set aside. He ate </span>from the figs that were left in the field, but when <span class="gemarra-regular">he gave </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">to his attendant </span>the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">did not eat. </span>Rabbi Ḥama <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Eat, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael bar Rabbi Yosei said to me the following </span>ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of his father: </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">most of the knives have been set aside, </span>the figs <span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted with regard to </span>the laws of <span class="gemarra-regular">stealing and are exempt from the tithe.</span>
The Gemara relates another incident: <span class="gemarra-regular">A certain man found Rabbi Tarfo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> eating </span>figs from his field <span class="gemarra-regular">at the time when most of the knives had been set aside. He placed </span>Rabbi Tarfon <span class="gemarra-regular">in a sack, lifted him up, and carried him to throw him into the river. </span>Rabbi Tarfon <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Woe to Tarfon, for this </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">is killing him. </span>When <span class="gemarra-regular">that man heard </span>that he was carrying the great Rabbi Tarfon, <span class="gemarra-regular">he left him and fled. Rabbi Abbahu said in the name of Rabbi Ḥananya ben Gamliel: All the days of that righteous man, </span>Rabbi Tarfon, <span class="gemarra-regular">he was distressed over this matter, saying: Woe is me, for I made use of the crown of Torah, </span>as Rabbi Tarfon was only released out of respect for his Torah learning.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to this statement, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar bar Ḥana said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Whoever makes use of the crown of Torah is uprooted from the world. </span>This can be derived by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">If Belshazzar, who made use of the sacred </span>Temple <span class="gemarra-regular">vessels, which had </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">become non-sacred vessels </span>by that time, as after their forcible removal from the Temple the vessels lost their sanctity, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated </span>in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And robbers shall enter into it, and profane it” </span>(Ezekiel 7:22), showing that <span class="gemarra-regular">once </span>the Temple vessels <span class="gemarra-regular">have been robbed they become non-sacred, was uprooted from the world </span>for his actions, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “On that night Belshazzar </span>the Chaldean king <span class="gemarra-regular">was killed” </span>(Daniel 5:30); <span class="gemarra-regular">one who makes use of the crown of Torah, which lives and endures forever </span>and whose sanctity cannot be removed, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>shall he be uprooted.
The Gemara returns to the incident involving Rabbi Tarfon. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon, since he was eating </span>during the time <span class="gemarra-regular">when most of the knives had been set aside, why did that man trouble him? </span>The Gemara explains: It was <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>someone <span class="gemarra-regular">had been stealing grapes from that </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">all year, and when he found Rabbi Tarfon he thought: This is </span>the one <span class="gemarra-regular">who stole from me </span>the entire year. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, why did Rabbi Tarfon berate himself? </span>Clearly he was justified in saving himself. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since Rabbi Tarfon was very wealthy, he should have </span>sought <span class="gemarra-regular">to appease him with money </span>in order to save himself, rather than relying on his status as a Torah scholar.
Apropos the story of Rabbi Tarfon’s regret for gaining personal benefit from his status as a Torah scholar, the Gemara cites similar teachings. It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“To love the Lord your God, to listen to His voice, and to cleave to Him” </span>(Deuteronomy 30:20). This verse indicates <span class="gemarra-regular">that a person should not say: I will read </span>the written Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">so that they will call me a Sage; I will study </span>Mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">so that they will call me Rabbi; I will review </span>my studies <span class="gemarra-regular">so that I will be an Elder and will sit in the academy. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, learn out of love</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the verse states: “To love the Lord your God.” <span class="gemarra-regular">And the honor will eventually come </span>of its own accord, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “Bind them upon your fingers</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> write them on the tablet of your heart” </span>(Proverbs 7:3), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it states: “Its ways are ways of pleasantness, </span>and all its paths are peace” (Proverbs 3:17), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it states: “It is a tree of life to those who grasp it; happy is everyone who holds it fast” </span>(Proverbs 3:17). Consequently, one who studies in order to master Torah for its own sake, as reflected in the verse “bind them upon your fingers,” will eventually merit pleasantness, peace, and happiness. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer bar Rabbi Tzadok says: Do things for the sake of their performance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> not for any ulterior motive, <span class="gemarra-regular">and speak </span>words <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">for their own sake. Do not make them a crow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with which to become glorified, and do not make them nor make them a dolabra [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kordom</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with which to hoe, </span>i.e., do not use Torah study as a means of earning a livelihood. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">If Belshazzar, who made use only of sacred vessels that had become non-sacred vessels, was uprooted from the world, one who makes use of the crown of Torah, </span>whose sanctity is permanent, <span class="gemarra-regular">all the more so </span>shall he be uprooted from the world. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said:</span> In a time of need, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is permitted for a person to make himself known in a place where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">do not know him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The proof is from what Obadiah said to Elijah in order to identify himself, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “But I, your servant, have feared the Lord from my youth” </span>(I Kings 18:12). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult </span>with regard to the story about <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tarfon, </span>who was distraught because he revealed his identity to the man who placed him in the sack. The Gemara answers: The case of Rabbi Tarfon is different, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he was very wealthy, and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">he should have </span>sought <span class="gemarra-regular">to appease him with money.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a contradiction: It is written </span>that Obadiah spoke highly of himself: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But I, your servant, have feared the Lord from my youth.” And it is written: “Let another praise you, and not your own mouth”</span> (Proverbs 27:2). He answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>verse is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a place where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">know him, </span>where he should not praise himself, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>verse is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to a place where </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">do not know him.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>further: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is permitted for a Torah scholar to say: I am a Torah scholar, </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">resolve my case first</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is written: “And the sons of David were priests” </span>(II Samuel 8:18). The sons of David could not have been actual priests, as David was not a priest. Rather, the verse indicates that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as a priest takes </span>his portion <span class="gemarra-regular">first, so too, a Torah scholar takes </span>his portion <span class="gemarra-regular">first. And a priest, from where do we </span>derive that he takes his portion first? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “And you shall sanctify him, for he offers the bread of your God”</span> (Leviticus 21:8). <span class="gemarra-regular">And the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: </span>The phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“and you shall sanctify him” </span>applies with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to every matter of sanctity: </span>

Daf 62b

<span class="gemarra-regular">To open </span>the Torah reading <span class="gemarra-regular">first</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to recite a blessing first</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and to take a fine portion first. </span>When portions are distributed equally, a priest can choose his share first. The verse with regard to the sons of David proves that the same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies to Torah scholars.
Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: It is permitted for a Torah scholar to say: I will not pay the head tax [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">karga</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as it is written </span>that the king of Persia wrote to Ezra, with regard to the priests, the Levites, and others who worked in the Temple: <span class="gemarra-regular">“It shall not be lawful to impose </span><span class="gemarra-italic">minda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">belo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakh</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> upon them” </span>(Ezra 7:24). <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehuda said: </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Minda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; this is the king’s portion</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">Belo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; this is the money </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">head </span>tax. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; this is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">arnona</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> a levy on people and their animals to perform physical labor in the service of the ruling authority. Since a Torah scholar is considered equivalent to a priest, as he is also dedicated to a sacred task, this exemption applies to him as well.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava said </span>further: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is permitted for a Torah schola</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to say: I am a servant </span>of the priests <span class="gemarra-regular">of fire </span>worship and therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not pay the head tax. </span>Rava maintains that a scholar may issue a statement of this kind in a place where the priests of fire-worshippers are exempt from the head tax, because he actually is declaring himself a servant of God, who is referred to as “a devouring fire” (Deuteronomy 4:24). <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that he is allowed to make this statement? He <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying</span> it merely in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to chase a lion </span>away <span class="gemarra-regular">from him, </span>i.e., to avoid suffering a loss.
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi had a particular forest, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he sold it </span>for its wood <span class="gemarra-regular">to</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the temple of fire </span>worship. <span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ashi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Isn’t there </span>the prohibition: <span class="gemarra-regular">“You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind” </span>(Leviticus 19:14), which prohibits assisting others in committing transgressions? And yet you are providing assistance to an idolatrous cult. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: Most </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">wood </span>they use <span class="gemarra-regular">is for kindling, </span>not for their ritual service. Consequently, I need not be concerned that the particular wood that I have sold them will be used for idolatry. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one takes a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">until the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">harvest</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the vow remains in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">until people begin to harvest. </span>This is referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the wheat harvest but not the barley harvest. </span>As for the exact date of this event, <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>is determined <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the place </span>where he took <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">If he was on a mountain, </span>it is assumed that he referred to the time of the harvest on <span class="gemarra-regular">the mountain, and if he was in a valley, </span>it is assumed that he meant the time of the harvest <span class="gemarra-regular">in the valley. </span>
If one takes a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">until the rains, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">until there are rains, </span>the vow remains in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">until the second rain </span>of the rainy season <span class="gemarra-regular">falls</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Until the time of the </span>second <span class="gemarra-regular">rainfall arrives</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> even if rain does not fall. If one takes a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">until </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">rains end</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the vow remains in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">until the entire </span>month of <span class="gemarra-regular">Nisan has ended; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: Until Passover has passed.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows until the summer in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Galile</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">descends to the valleys, even if the summer </span>season <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">arrived in the valleys, </span>the subject of his vow remains <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">until summer arrives in the Galilee, </span>in accordance with the mishna’s ruling that the duration of a vow is in accordance with the place where it was made. 
The mishna states that if one takes a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">until the rains, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">until there are rains, </span>he means <span class="gemarra-regular">until the second rain </span>of the rainy season. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: </span>Until the time of the second rainfall arrives. The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Zeira said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>is in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Until the rains. However, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he says: Until the rain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> everyone agrees that <span class="gemarra-regular">he is saying </span>that the vow should remain in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">until the time of the rains, </span>but not necessarily until the rain actually falls.

The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>against the statement by Rabbi Zeira from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">When is the time of the rainfall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> The early </span>rainfall occurs <span class="gemarra-regular">on the third </span>of the month of Marḥeshvan; the <span class="gemarra-regular">intermediate </span>rainfall is <span class="gemarra-regular">on the seventh </span>of the month, while the <span class="gemarra-regular">late </span>rainfall is <span class="gemarra-regular">on the twenty-third </span>of the month. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>The respective dates are <span class="gemarra-regular">on the seventh, on the seventeenth, and on the twenty-third </span>of Marḥeshvan. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says: </span>The first two time periods are <span class="gemarra-regular">on the seventeenth and on the twenty-third </span>of Marḥeshvan, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the last period is <span class="gemarra-regular">at </span>the beginning of the <span class="gemarra-regular">month of Kislev. And so too, Rabbi Yosei would say: </span>The learned <span class="gemarra-regular">individuals, </span>who would start to fast due to a drought at an earlier time than the rest of the community, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not </span>start to <span class="gemarra-regular">fast until the New Moon of Kislev arrives </span>and no rain has fallen.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And we say about this: Granted, </span>they disagreed over the time of the <span class="gemarra-regular">first rainfall, </span>as this time is relevant with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to asking </span>for rain through prayer. The time when the <span class="gemarra-regular">third </span>rainfall is expected is relevant with regard <span class="gemarra-regular">to fasting </span>due to lack of rain. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>as for the expected time for the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>rainfall, <span class="gemarra-regular">for what </span>purpose did they disagree about its date? <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Zeira said: </span>It is significant <span class="gemarra-regular">for one who vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> until the rain.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">we say about this: In accordance with whose opinion is that which is taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">rains that fell </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">seven days, one after another, you count them </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">the first rainfall and </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second. In accordance with whose</span> opinion is this statement? <span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>who is the only <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who holds that the first and second periods of rainfall span seven days. It is evident from this discussion that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel argues that one who vows until the rain must wait until after the second actual rainfall. This contradicts the statement of Rabbi Zeira that until the rain is referring to the date when rain is supposed to fall. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Until the rains, </span>rather than: Until the rain. Consequently, the expiration of his vow is determined by the actual time of rainfall.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of one who said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wine is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> will not taste </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for the </span>entire <span class="gemarra-regular">year</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> if <span class="gemarra-regular">the year was extended, </span>i.e., it was declared to be a leap year, he is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibited </span>from drinking wine <span class="gemarra-regular">during </span>the year <span class="gemarra-regular">and its intercalated </span>month. If he vowed <span class="gemarra-regular">until the beginning of </span>the month of <span class="gemarra-regular">Adar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the vow remains in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">until the beginning </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first Adar. </span>Similarly, if he says that his vow applies <span class="gemarra-regular">until the end of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Adar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the vow remains in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">until the end of the first </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Adar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments on the statement in the mishna that if one takes a vow until the beginning of Adar, it remains in effect until the beginning of the first Adar. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>when one <span class="gemarra-regular">says Adar without specification, </span>his statement <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>understood as a reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>Adar. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Shall we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda? As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>month of <span class="gemarra-regular">Adar, </span>when dating a document, one <span class="gemarra-regular">writes </span>that the document was composed in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first Adar. </span>During the <span class="gemarra-regular">second Adar, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">writes </span>the name of the month of <span class="gemarra-regular">Adar without specification; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says </span>the reverse: During <span class="gemarra-regular">the first Adar </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">writes </span>the name of the month <span class="gemarra-regular">without specification, </span>and in the <span class="gemarra-regular">second Adar </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">writes </span>that the document was composed in the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>Adar. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: You </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">even say </span>that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, </span>as there is a difference between the cases: In <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the case is one <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the individual who took the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">knew that the year was extended, </span>i.e., declared as a leap year, and the disagreement concerns which Adar is considered the principal one. Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did not know </span>that it is a leap year and that there are two months of Adar. Consequently, when he referred to Adar, all agree that he meant the first Adar. 

Daf 63b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And, </span>so too, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one vows <span class="gemarra-regular">until the New Moon of Adar, </span>the vow remains in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">until the New Moon of the first Adar, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">if it was a leap year, </span>it remains in effect <span class="gemarra-regular">until the New Moon of the second Adar. </span>
The Gemara analyzes this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Does the latter clause prove <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause, we are not dealing with a leap </span>year? In a regular year there is only one month of Adar, so it is impossible to speak of a first or second Adar. Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from it </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>latter clause is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious to him that the year was extended, </span>and therefore when he refers to the month of Adar he means the second Adar, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>first clause is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">did not know </span>that it was a leap year, in which case he means the first Adar. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>In the case of one who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wine is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not taste </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">until it will be </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Passover</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> it is understood that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">intended </span>for his vow to apply <span class="gemarra-regular">only until the night of </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Passover</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., <span class="gemarra-regular">until the time when it is customary for people to drink wine </span>in order to fulfill the mitzva of drinking the four cups, but he did not intend to prevent himself from being able to fulfill this mitzva. 
Similarly, if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Meat is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not taste </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">until it will be the fas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> of Yom Kippur, <span class="gemarra-regular">he is prohibited </span>from eating meat <span class="gemarra-regular">only until the eve of [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">leilei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] the fast. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>it is understood that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">intended </span>for his vow to apply <span class="gemarra-regular">only until the time when it is customary for people to eat meat </span>in the festive meal before the fast, and he did not intend to prevent himself from being able to participate in that meal. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, his son, says: </span>One who vows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Garli</span><span class="gemarra-regular">c</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will not <span class="gemarra-regular">taste </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">until it will be Shabbat, it is prohibited </span>for him to eat garlic <span class="gemarra-regular">only until the eve of Shabbat, as </span>it is understood that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">intended </span>for his vow to apply <span class="gemarra-regular">only until the time when it is customary for people to eat garlic. </span>
In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to another: Benefiting from you is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me, </span>i.e., I am prohibited from deriving benefit from you, <span class="gemarra-regular">if you do not come and take for your so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of wheat and two barrels of wine </span>as a gift, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>other individual <span class="gemarra-regular">can dissolve his vow without </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">consent </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">a halakhic authority</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This is because <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: </span>Did <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>your vow for <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">other than due to my honor, </span>in order to convince me to accept a gift for my son? <span class="gemarra-regular">This is my honor, </span>that I refrain from accepting the gift, and consequently the vow is annulled.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And, so too, </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to another: Benefiting from me is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for you, </span>i.e., you are prohibited from deriving benefit from me, <span class="gemarra-regular">if you do not come and give my so</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kor</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of wheat and two barrels of wine, Rabbi Meir says: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> for the other individual to benefit from the speaker <span class="gemarra-regular">until he gives</span> the gifts to his son. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis say: Even this </span>individual who took the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">can dissolve his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">vow without </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">consent of a halakhic authority. </span>This is because <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: I hereby </span>consider it <span class="gemarra-regular">as though I have received </span>the gift. 
If an individual <span class="gemarra-regular">was urging </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">to marry the daughter of his sister</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>in order to deflect the pressure, the other man <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Benefiting from me is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for her forever, </span>i.e., she is prohibited from deriving any benefit from me forever, <span class="gemarra-regular">and, so too, </span>if there is <span class="gemarra-regular">one who divorces his wife </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: Benefiting from me is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">my wife forever, these </span>women <span class="gemarra-regular">are permitted to </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from him, as this </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">intended </span>to take this vow <span class="gemarra-regular">only for the purpose </span>of prohibiting <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage </span>between them, but not to prohibit all forms of benefit.
Similarly, if one <span class="gemarra-regular">was urging another </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">eat with him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Entering your house </span>is <span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">me, </span>as is <span class="gemarra-regular">tasting </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">a drop of cold liquid of yours, </span>the individual who took the vow is nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted to enter his house and to drink a cold </span>beverage <span class="gemarra-regular">of his. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because this </span>individual <span class="gemarra-regular">intended </span>to take this vow <span class="gemarra-regular">only for the purpose of eating and drinking </span>a meal, but not to prohibit himself from entering the house entirely or from drinking in small quantities (Commentary on <span class="it-text">Nedarim</span>). 


Daf 64a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>When halakhic authorities are approached with regard to the dissolution of a vow, they <span class="gemarra-regular">may broach </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> who took a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>raising the issue of how taking the vow ultimately degraded <span class="gemarra-regular">the honor of his father and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">mother</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> asking him the following: Had you known that your parents would experience public shame due to your lax attitude toward your vow, would you still have taken the vow? <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Rabbis </span>disagree with Rabbi Eliezer and <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibit </span>broaching dissolution of a vow with this particular question.
To support the opinion of the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Tzadok said: Instead of broaching </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with him by </span>raising the issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">the honor of his father and mother, let them broach </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with him by </span>raising the issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">the honor of the Omnipresent. </span>They should point out that a vow taken in the name of God lessens the honor of God, so they could ask him: If you had known that your vow would diminish the honor of God, would you have taken your vow? And <span class="gemarra-regular">if so, </span>if this is a valid method of broaching dissolution, <span class="gemarra-regular">there are no vows. </span>Nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Eliezer with regard to </span>a vow concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter that is between him and his fathe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and mother, that </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">may broach </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with him by </span>raising the issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">the honor of his father and mother, </span>as in this case the extenuation is connected to this particular vow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Eliezer further said: </span>They <span class="gemarra-regular">may broach </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>asking about <span class="gemarra-regular">a new situation, but the Rabbis prohibit </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">How </span>might they broach dissolution by asking about a new situation? If one <span class="gemarra-regular">said: It is </span>forbidden to me <span class="gemarra-regular">like an offering [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] that I will </span>therefore not <span class="gemarra-regular">derive</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> benefit from so-and-so, and </span>that person later <span class="gemarra-regular">became a scribe [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sofer</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the one who took the vow now requires his services, <span class="gemarra-regular">or if </span>the one forbidden by the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">was marrying off his son </span>and prepared a feast for all the residents of his town, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the one that had taken the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Had </span><span class="gemarra-regular">I</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> known that he would become a scribe, or that he would be marrying off his son in the near </span>future, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would not have vowed. </span>
The mishna cites another example of a new situation. If one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Entering this house is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that house <span class="gemarra-regular">became a synagogue, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: Had I known that it would become a synagogue, I would not have vowed, </span>in this and all such cases <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer permits </span>the halakhic authority to use this as a basis for the dissolution of the vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis prohibit </span>it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara clarifies the meaning of the statement made by Rabbi Tzadok. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">there are no vows, </span>mean? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>It means: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, vows are not dissolved </span><span class="gemarra-regular">properly</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The one who took the vow might say he regrets doing so only because he is not willing to publicly state that he would have taken his vow despite knowing that it diminishes the honor of God. He may not actually regret having taken the vow, and this will lead to the improper dissolution of the vow. 

Daf 64b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava said: </span>It means: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, there are no requests </span>for the dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">of vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to a halakhic authority. </span>Since this type of extenuation applies to all vows, people will therefore assume that their vows are automatically dissolved, and will not take the required steps to dissolve them. 
The Gemara analyzes the dispute between Abaye and Rava: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Eliezer with regard to </span>a vow concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter that is between him and his father and mother, that </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">may broach </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with him by </span>raising the issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">the honor of his father and mother. Granted, according to Abaye, who said: If so, vows are not dissolved </span>properly, <span class="gemarra-regular">here, since he was impudent toward him </span>by stating a vow that subjects his parent to a prohibition, <span class="gemarra-regular">he was impudent toward him </span>and has demonstrated that he is not concerned for their honor. In such a case, there is no concern that he would pretend to regret his vow due to his parents’ honor. This is why the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Eliezer.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But according to Rava, who said: If so, there are no requests </span>for dissolution made <span class="gemarra-regular">to a halakhic authority, here, </span>in the case of one whose vow involves his parents, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>may they <span class="gemarra-regular">broach </span>dissolution in this way? Why is there not a concern that people will assume that this dissolves all vows automatically? The Gemara answers: The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Since it is not sufficient </span>and applicable <span class="gemarra-regular">for all vows not </span>to request dissolution from <span class="gemarra-regular">a halakhic authority, </span>because the Rabbis maintain that in general, the honor of one’s parents cannot be used to broach dissolution, <span class="gemarra-regular">here too, </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">may broach </span>dissolution by invoking the honor of a parent. There is no concern that this may lead one to think that vows are dissolved automatically, as this extenuation applies only to this particular vow.
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Eliezer further said: </span>They <span class="gemarra-regular">may broach </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>asking about <span class="gemarra-regular">a new situation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but the Rabbis prohibit it. The Gemara inquires: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer? Rav Ḥisda said: For the verse states </span>that God told Moses he could return to Egypt from Midian, despite having vowed to Yitro that he would not do so: <span class="gemarra-regular">“For all the men are dead </span>that sought your life” (Exodus 4:19), and he took the vow only because it would be dangerous for him to return to Egypt. The Gemara explains the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">But death is a new circumstance, </span>and Moses’ vow was dissolved based on the men dying. Therefore, it can be understood <span class="gemarra-regular">from here that </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">may broach </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>asking about <span class="gemarra-regular">a new situation.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, what is their reason </span>for not accepting this proof? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">They hold: These </span>people who were seeking Moses’ life, <span class="gemarra-regular">had they </span>indeed <span class="gemarra-regular">died? But Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: Wherever it is stated </span>in the Torah the term <span class="gemarra-regular">striving </span>(Exodus 2:13), in reference to the men who slandered Moses, <span class="gemarra-regular">or standing </span>(Exodus 5:20), in reference to those who complained against Moses and Aaron, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are none other than Dathan and Abiram. </span>Dathan and Abiram were alive during the rebellion of Korah, which occurred years later, so they could not have been dead when God instructed Moses to return to Egypt. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Reish Lakish said: </span>They did not literally die, but the verse means <span class="gemarra-regular">that they lost their propert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> and their status in the community, which meant their opinions were no longer granted credibility, and consequently, Moses could safely return to Egypt. Such a turn of events is not considered to be a new circumstance.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Any person who does not have children is considered like a dead </span>person. The source is <span class="gemarra-regular">as is stated </span>in the words Rachel said to Jacob: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Give me children, or else I am dead” </span>(Genesis 30:1). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it was taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Four are considered as </span>if they were <span class="gemarra-regular">dead: A pauper, and a leper, and a blind </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and one who has no children. A pauper, as it is written: “For all the men are dead” </span>(Exodus 4:19). As explained above, they were not actually dead but had descended into poverty, and yet they were considered dead. <span class="gemarra-regular">A leper, as it is written </span>that Aaron said to Moses with regard to Miriam’s leprosy: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Let her not, I pray, be as one dead” </span>(Numbers 12:12). <span class="gemarra-regular">And a blind </span>person, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “He has made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead” </span>(Lamentations 3:6). <span class="gemarra-regular">And one who has no children, as it is written: “Give me children, or else I am dead” </span>(Genesis 30:1). 

Daf 65a

§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> (<span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> 2:12): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit from another</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> they dissolve </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for him only in the presence </span>of the one who is the subject of the vow. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where are these matters </span>derived? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: As it is written: “And the Lord said to Moses in Midian: Go, return to Egypt; for all the men are dead” </span>(Exodus 4:19). Rav Naḥman notes that the verse specifies where God spoke to Moses, and explains that God <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">In Midian you vowed </span>to Yitro that you would not return to Egypt, <span class="gemarra-regular">go and dissolve your vow in Midian. </span>And where does it say that Moses vowed to Yitro? <span class="gemarra-regular">For it is written: “And Moses was content [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">vayo’el</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>to dwell with the man” (Exodus 2:21). The word <span class="it-text">vayo’el</span> is related to the word <span class="it-text">ala</span>, and <span class="gemarra-italic">ala</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> means nothing other than an oath, as it is written: “And he…brought him under an oath [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ala</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Ezekiel 17:13), and the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of dissolution of oaths are identical to those of dissolution of vows.
The Gemara cites another proof that one may dissolve such a vow or oath only in the presence of the party affect by the vow or oath. It states with regard to King Zedekiah: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And he also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God” </span>(II Chronicles 36:13). The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">his rebellion? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Zedekiah found Nebuchadnezzar eating a live rabbit, </span>and the latter was ashamed to be seen doing this. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: Take an oath to me that you will not reveal my </span>behavior <span class="gemarra-regular">and this matter will not emerge </span>in public. Zedekiah <span class="gemarra-regular">took an oath </span>to him. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Later, Zedekiah was physically suffering, </span>as he wanted to tell people what he had seen, but he could not do so due to his oath. <span class="gemarra-regular">He requested </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">of his oath </span>from the judges of the Sanhedrin, who dissolved it for him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and he </span>publicly <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>what he had witnessed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Nebuchadnezzar heard that he was being ridiculed </span>for his behavior. <span class="gemarra-regular">He sent </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">and brought the Sanhedrin and Zedekiah </span>before him. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: Did you see what Zedekiah has done? Did he not take an oath in the name of Heaven: That I will not reveal? They said to him: He requested </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">of the oath. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said to them: Can one request </span>the dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">of an oath? They said to him: Yes. He said to them: </span>Must this be done <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence </span>of the person he took an oath to, <span class="gemarra-regular">or even not in his presence? They said to him: </span>It must be dissolved <span class="gemarra-regular">in his presence. He said to them: And you, what did you do? What is the reason you did not say to Zedekiah </span>that he can have his oath dissolved only in my presence? <span class="gemarra-regular">Immediately, </span>they fulfilled the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“They sit upon the ground, and keep silence, the elders of the daughter of Zion” </span>(Lamentations 2:10). <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yitzḥak said: </span>This means <span class="gemarra-regular">that they removed </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">cushions </span>upon which they sat <span class="gemarra-regular">from underneath them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as a sign that they had erred in <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> As a continuation of the opinion of the Rabbis in the previous mishna that they may not broach dissolution of a vow based on a new situation, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: There are matters that are, </span>at first glance, <span class="gemarra-regular">like a new situation but are not </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">like a new </span><span class="gemarra-regular">situation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and the Rabbis do not concede to him. How so? </span>For example, <span class="gemarra-regular">one said: Marrying so-and-so is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, <span class="gemarra-regular">as her father is evil, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">they told him </span>that her father <span class="gemarra-regular">died, or that</span> he <span class="gemarra-regular">repented. </span>Or he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Entering this house is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, <span class="gemarra-regular">as there is a bad dog inside it, or a snake inside it, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">they told him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the dog died, or that the snake was killed. This is </span>at first glance perceived <span class="gemarra-regular">like a new situation, and </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">it is not </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">like a new situation, </span>and this claim may be used to broach dissolution. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Rabbis do not concede to him.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught that according to Rabbi Meir certain matters are similar to, but in fact do not constitute a new situation, such as a vow which states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Entering this house is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, <span class="gemarra-regular">as there is a </span>bad <span class="gemarra-regular">dog </span>there, where the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that if the dog dies, it is not considered to be a new situation. The Gemara asks: Certainly <span class="gemarra-regular">death is a new situation. Rav Huna said: He is considered like one who makes his vow dependent on a matter. </span>In other words, his vow is interpreted as conditional, that he will not enter the house as long as the dog is alive, for he explicitly stated that this was the reason for his vow. Therefore, when the dog dies, the vow is dissolved. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yoḥanan said </span>it means that <span class="gemarra-regular">they say to him: </span>The dog had <span class="gemarra-regular">already </span><span class="gemarra-regular">died</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or:</span> The father had <span class="gemarra-regular">already repented, </span>before the vow, and it was a mistaken vow from the outset that never took effect. 

Daf 65b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba raised an objection </span>from a later mishna (66a): If a one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not marry ugly so-and-so </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">that is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, <span class="gemarra-regular">and she is </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">beautiful, </span>or if he called her <span class="gemarra-regular">black, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and she is </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">white, </span>or if he called her <span class="gemarra-regular">short, and she is </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">tall, he is permitted to her. Not because she </span>was <span class="gemarra-regular">ugly and became beautiful, black and became white, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">short and became tall, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, </span>because <span class="gemarra-regular">the vow was mistaken </span>from the outset. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, according to Rav Huna, who said that he is considered like one who makes his vow dependent on a matter, </span>the mishna here <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>the case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">makes his vow dependent on a matter, and it taught </span>there the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a mistaken vow. But according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, who said </span>that the mishna here is referring to a situation where the dog had <span class="gemarra-regular">already died, or </span>the father had <span class="gemarra-regular">already repented, why do I </span>need the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">to teach </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a mistaken vow twice? </span>The Gemara comments: This is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Meir further said: </span>The halakhic authorities <span class="gemarra-regular">may broach </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with him from that which is written in the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">may say to him: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Had you known that </span>through your vow <span class="gemarra-regular">you are transgressing </span>the prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">“you shall not take vengeance” </span>(Leviticus 19:18) <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">“nor bear any grudge” </span>(Leviticus 19:18), <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the prohibition <span class="gemarra-regular">“you shall not hate your brother in your heart” </span>(Leviticus 19:17), and <span class="gemarra-regular">“you shall love your neighbor as yourself” </span>(Leviticus 19:18), as well as <span class="gemarra-regular">“and your brother </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">live with you” </span>(Leviticus 25:36), <span class="gemarra-regular">as he, </span>the one prohibited by the vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">is poor and </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">you are not able to provide him </span>with a livelihood due to your vow, would you have vowed in that case? If <span class="gemarra-regular">he said </span>in reply: <span class="gemarra-regular">Had I known that it is so, </span>that my vow involved all these prohibitions, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would not have vowed; it is dissolved. </span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna bar Rav Ketina said to the Sages: </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>the one who stated the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>with regard to the last claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">All who become poor do not fall upon me; </span>it is not my responsibility to provide for this specific poor person. <span class="gemarra-regular">What is placed upon me to provide for him together with everyone </span><span class="gemarra-regular">else</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">I will provide </span>to <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>when I give money to those collecting for the communal charity fund. <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to him: I say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who falls </span>into poverty and requires assistance <span class="gemarra-regular">does not fall into the hands of the </span>charity <span class="gemarra-regular">collector first. </span>Rather, his descent begins when he encounters hard times, and it is at this stage that he may require individual, direct support to prevent him from plunging into a state of absolute poverty. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The halakhic authorities <span class="gemarra-regular">may broach </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with a man by </span>raising the issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife’s marriage </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contract</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If one takes a vow that would require him to divorce his wife, e.g., he prohibits her from deriving benefit from him, his vow may be dissolved by asking him whether he had considered how difficult it would be to pay her marriage contract. 
The mishna relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">And an incident </span>occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to one who vowed </span>against <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife </span>deriving <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from </span>him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and her marriage contract was </span>worth <span class="gemarra-regular">four hundred dinars. And he came before Rabbi Akiva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he obligated him to give her </span>the payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract. He said to </span>Rabbi Akiva: <span class="gemarra-regular">My teacher, </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father left eight hundred dinars </span>as our inheritance, of which <span class="gemarra-regular">my brother took four hundred and I </span>took <span class="gemarra-regular">four hundred. Isn’t it enough for </span>my wife <span class="gemarra-regular">to take two hundred and I </span>will have <span class="gemarra-regular">two hundred? Rabbi Akiva said to him: </span>Your claim is not accepted, as <span class="gemarra-regular">even if you sell the hair on your head, you must give her </span>the full payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">her marriage contract. He said to him: Had I known that it was so, </span>that I would have to give her all my property, <span class="gemarra-regular">I would not have vowed. And Rabbi Akiva permitted her </span>to derive benefit from him.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara questions the comment made by Rabbi Akiva, that even if the man were to sell the hair on his head, he must pay her the full sum of her marriage contract: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is movable property mortgaged for </span>the payment of <span class="gemarra-regular">a marriage </span><span class="gemarra-regular">contract</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The Rabbis maintain that only land owned by the husband is mortgaged for the payment of a marriage contract, so why should he have to sell the hair on his head? <span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said: </span>He said that the father had left <span class="gemarra-regular">land worth eight hundred dinars, </span>and he received four hundred dinars’ worth of land, so all of his land is equal in value to his wife’s marriage contract. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that he must pay even from: <span class="gemarra-regular">The hair on his head, and the hair on his head is movable property. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is what he said: </span>You must pay the marriage contract from the land <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>will need to <span class="gemarra-regular">sell </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">hair on your head and </span>use the proceeds from the sale in order to <span class="gemarra-regular">eat, </span>as you will have no other source of income.
The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Should you conclude from </span>the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">arrangements are not mad</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with a creditor</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but instead, the entire sum is collected immediately, without reaching an agreement with the husband’s creditors to leave him some money to support himself? The Gemara refutes this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman, son of Rabbi Yitzḥak, said: </span>

Daf 66a

In fact, arrangements are made with creditors. Rather, Rabbi Akiva is <span class="gemarra-regular">saying that </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">do not tear the document of the marriage contract. </span>Even if in practice he is left with enough to survive on, the debt remains in force, so that when he will have more money, she will be paid in full.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one vowed that certain food or drink or all food and drink be forbidden to him, the halakhic authorities <span class="gemarra-regular">may broach </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>raising the issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">Festival</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">Shabbatot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>They ask him whether he realized at the time he stated his vow that he would have to uphold it on these festive days as well. <span class="gemarra-regular">At first they said</span> that on <span class="gemarra-regular">those days </span>that he did not intend to include in his vow, that item <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted, but </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">all the rest of the days, </span>food and drink ar<span class="gemarra-regular">e </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden </span>by his vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">until Rabbi Akiva came and taught that a vow that is partially dissolved is dissolved entirely. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>In the case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>to a group of people: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not benefit </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from all of yo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">u</span> as <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, if benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">one of them was permitted </span>for whatever reason, benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">all of them is permitted.</span>
However, if one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not benefit from this </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">and from that </span>one as it is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, then if benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">was permitte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> for whatever reason, benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> permitted. </span>But if benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">the last </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">was permitted, </span>benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">the last </span>one alone <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted, but </span>benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the others <span class="gemarra-regular">is forbidden, </span>as the benefit from each is considered to have been prohibited by a separate vow. If benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">the middle </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">was permitted, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">from him and below, </span>i.e., all those enumerated after him, benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted; from him and above, </span>i.e., those listed before him, benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">is forbidden.</span>
The mishna gives another example of interconnected vows: If one stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will </span>not <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from this </span>one, as if he were <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering, and from that </span>one, as if he were <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">an extenuation </span>enabling the dissolution of a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">is required for each and every one, </span>as they have the status of separate vows. 
The mishna gives another example of a vow that was partially dissolved. If one stated in a vow: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wine is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me and <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will not <span class="gemarra-regular">taste it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as wine is bad for the intestines, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">they said to him: But aged wine is good for the intestines, </span>then the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">is dissolved with regard to aged wine.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And not only with regard to aged wine is it dissolved, but with regard to all </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">wine, </span>since a vow that has been partially dissolved is entirely dissolved. Likewise, if one stated in a vow: <span class="gemarra-regular">Onions are </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me and <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not taste them, as onions are bad for the heart, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">they said to him: But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kufer</span><span class="gemarra-italic">i</span> onion <span class="gemarra-regular">is good for the heart, </span>then, in this case too, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is dissolved with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kuferi</span> onions, <span class="gemarra-regular">and not only with regard to </span><span class="gemarra-italic">kuferi</span> onions is it dissolved, <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to all </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">onions. </span>The mishna relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident </span>of this kind <span class="gemarra-regular">occurred, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Meir dissolved </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to all </span>types of <span class="gemarra-regular">onions.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna taught: If benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">the last </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">was permitted, </span>benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">the last </span>one alone <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted but </span>benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span>the others <span class="gemarra-regular">is forbidden. </span>If one stated: I will not benefit from this one, as if he were an offering, and from that one, as if he were an offering, then an extenuation enabling the dissolution of a vow is required for each and every one. The Gemara poses a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">taught </span>this mishna?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: It is</span> taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, who said </span>that one who utters a false oath to several people at once is not liable to bring an offering for each false oath <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he says: An oath, </span>in his oath <span class="gemarra-regular">to each and every one </span>(<span class="it-text">Shevuot</span> 38a). If he said: An oath, only once, even if he specified each person by saying: Not to you, not to you, it is still considered to be a single oath. Otherwise, it is viewed as one oath. The mishna, which requires a separate extenuation for each person only if he stated: As if he were an offering, with regard to each of them, is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon stated with regard to oaths. 
The mishna taught that if one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Wine is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me and <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will not <span class="gemarra-regular">taste it, </span>as wine is bad for the intestines, his vow is dissolved, for aged wine is good for the intestines. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let him derive </span>that the vow is dissolved from the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>aged wine is <span class="gemarra-regular">not bad </span>for the intestines. Even if it is not actively good for the intestines, the vow should nevertheless be considered mistaken. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said: </span>The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: And furthermore, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">good. </span>In other words, even if aged wine is merely not harmful to the intestines the vow is dissolved, and they strengthened their claim by pointing out that it is in fact beneficial. 
The mishna taught: If one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Onions are </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me and <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>will not <span class="gemarra-regular">taste them, as onions </span>are bad for the heart, his vow is dissolved, for <span class="it-text">kuferi</span> onions are good for the heart. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let him derive </span>that the vow is dissolved from the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="it-text">kuferi</span> onion is <span class="gemarra-regular">not bad </span>for the heart. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said: </span>The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: And furthermore, </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">good. </span>Here too, they added that the <span class="it-text">kuferi</span> onion is actually good for the heart, but this addition was not needed to justify the dissolution of the vow. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The halakhic authorities <span class="gemarra-regular">may broach </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">for a person by </span>raising the issue of <span class="gemarra-regular">his own honor and the honor of his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">children</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> For example, if he took a vow that resulted in his needing to divorce his wife, they may <span class="gemarra-regular">say to him: Had you known that tomorrow people will say about you: This is the habit [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">veset</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">of so-and-so, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he divorces his wives</span> due to vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">and they will say about your daughters: They are daughters of divorce, </span>or they will ask: <span class="gemarra-regular">What did their mother </span><span class="gemarra-regular">se</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to divorce, </span>thereby giving them a bad reputation. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if the man who vowed <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Had I known it was so, I would not have vowed, it is dissolved.</span>
The mishna continues: If a man said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Marrying ugly so-and-so is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me, and she is </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">beautiful</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or if, in vowing not to marry her, he called her <span class="gemarra-regular">black, and she is </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">white, </span>or if, in vowing not to marry her, he called her <span class="gemarra-regular">short, and she is </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">tall, he is permitted to her. Not because she was ugly and became beautiful, black and became white, </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">short and became tall, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">rather, because the vow was mistaken </span>from the outset.
The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">And an incident </span>occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to one who vowed </span>against deriving <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from the daughter of his sister</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as he did not wish to marry her. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they brought her into </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">house of Rabbi Yishmae</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he beautified her. </span>When she was later brought before the one who took the vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael said to him: My son, did you vow </span>that you would not derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>woman? <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to him: No, and Rabbi Yishmael permitted he</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> to him, as he demonstrated that the vow had been made in error.
<span class="gemarra-regular">At that time Rabbi Yishmael wept and said: The daughters of Israel are beautiful, but poverty makes them ugly. And when Rabbi Yishmael died, the daughters of Israel raised a lamentation, saying: Daughters of Israel, weep for Rabbi Yishmael. And it likewise states about Saul, </span>who also concerned himself with the welfare of the daughters of Israel: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, </span>who clothed you in scarlet with other delights, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel” (II Samuel 1:24).
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara poses a question: Was <span class="gemarra-regular">an incident </span>cited <span class="gemarra-regular">to contradict </span>what was just taught? It first taught that if she was ugly and was later beautified, the vow is not dissolved, and then the mishna quoted an incident involving Rabbi Yishmael where he did dissolve the vow. The Gemara answers: The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is incomplete and this is what it is teaching: Rabbi Yishmael says: Even if she was ugly and became beautiful, black and became white, short and became tall,</span> the vow can be dissolved. <span class="gemarra-regular">An incident </span>occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to one who vowed </span>against having benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from the daughter of his sister, </span>as he did not wish to marry her. <span class="gemarra-regular">And they brought her into Rabbi Yishmael’s house and he beautified her. </span>

Daf 66b

It was <span class="gemarra-regular">taught: She had a false tooth [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shen</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">totevet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which disfigured her, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Yishmael made her a gold tooth </span><span class="gemarra-regular">from his own </span>money, thereby beautifying her. <span class="gemarra-regular">When Rabbi Yishmael died, a certain eulogizer began </span>his eulogy <span class="gemarra-regular">about him like this: Daughters of Israel, weep for Rabbi Yishmael, who clothed you. </span>
§ The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to his wife: Benefiting from me is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">you until you have given Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon your cooked food to taste, </span>so they can see for themselves what a bad cook you are. She brought the food to them, and <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehuda tasted </span>it, without concern for his honor. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said: </span>This is an <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">And what</span> can be seen, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to make peace between a man and his wife, the Torah said: My name, that is written in sanctity, shall be blotted out in the waters that curse, </span>as the words written on a scroll, including the name of God, were blotted out during the ceremony of preparing the water that a <span class="it-text">sota</span> would drink. And this is so even <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case of where it is <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertain </span>if this will bring peace between them, as she may or not be guilty of adultery. <span class="gemarra-regular">I, all the more so, </span>should waive my honor in order to bring peace to this couple.
Conversely, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon did not taste.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> He said: Let all the children of the widow die, and Shimon will not budg</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from his place. </span>In other words, the husband can die and leave his wife a widow and his children orphans, and let them die too, rather than have people belittle the dignity of Torah scholars by taking such vows. <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>there is another reason for my refusal: <span class="gemarra-regular">So that they should not become used to taking vows. </span>
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to his wife: Benefiting from me is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">you until you have spat on Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. She came </span>to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <span class="gemarra-regular">and spat on his clothing. Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: But this </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">intended the humiliation </span>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, which is not achieved by spitting on his clothing. Ravina <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Spittle on the clothing of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel is a great humiliation </span>for him, and she has thereby fulfilled the vow. 
The Gemara relates: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to his wife: Benefiting from me is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">you until you show some beautiful </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yafeh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] part of you to Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei. </span>Rabbi Yishmael attempted to find something beautiful about the woman.
<span class="gemarra-regular">He said to </span>his students: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps her head is beautiful? They said to him: </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">round [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">segalgal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Perhaps her hair is beautiful? </span>They replied: Her hair <span class="gemarra-regular">resembles stalks of flax. Perhaps her eyes are beautiful? They are narrow [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">terutot</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Perhaps her ears are beautiful? They are double </span>in size. <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps her nose is beautiful? It is stubby</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Perhaps her lips are beautiful? They are thick. Perhaps her neck is beautiful? It is low </span>and short. <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps her stomach is beautiful? It is swollen. Perhaps her legs are beautiful? </span>They are <span class="gemarra-regular">as wide as a goose’s. Perhaps her name is beautiful? Her name is Likhlukhit. He said to them: It is fitting </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">y</span><span class="gemarra-italic">afeh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">she is called </span>by the name <span class="gemarra-regular">Likhlukhit, as she is dirty [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">melukhlekhet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] with blemishes, and he permitted her </span>to benefit from her husband, because she did have one beautiful feature, her fitting name.
The Gemara cites another incident: There was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain Babylonia</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who went up to Eretz Yisrael </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">married a woman </span>there. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to her: Cook two lentils, </span>i.e., some lentils, <span class="gemarra-regular">for me. She cooked </span>exactly <span class="gemarra-regular">two lentils for him. He grew angry with her. On the following day,</span> so that she would not repeat what she had done, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to her:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Cook a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">geriva</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me, </span>intending: A large amount. <span class="gemarra-regular">She cooked an </span>actual <span class="gemarra-italic">se’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for him, </span>far more than what one person could eat. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to her: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Go and bring me two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">butzinei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> intending small gourds, as <span class="it-text">butzinei</span> are small gourds in the Aramaic dialect spoken in Babylonia. <span class="gemarra-regular">She went and brought him two lamps [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sheraggei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> called <span class="it-text">butzinei</span> in the Aramaic dialect spoken in Eretz Yisrael.
In anger, <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to her: Go and break them on the head of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">bava</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>intending the gate, as <span class="it-text">bava</span> means a gate in the Aramaic dialect spoken in Babylonia. She did not recognize this word. At that time, the Sage <span class="gemarra-regular">Bava ben But</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> was sitting as a judge at the gate. She went and broke them on his head, </span>as his name was Bava. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said to her: What is this you have done? She said to him: This is what my husband commanded me </span>to do. <span class="gemarra-regular">He said: You fulfilled your husband’s desire</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may the Omnipresent bring forth from you two sons, </span>corresponding to the two candles, <span class="gemarra-regular">like Bava ben Buta. </span>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a betrothed young woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> her father and her husband </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify her vows. </span>

Daf 67a

If <span class="gemarra-regular">the father nullified </span>her vow <span class="gemarra-regular">and the husband did not nullify </span>it, or if <span class="gemarra-regular">the husband nullified </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and the father did not nullify </span>it, then the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">is not nullified. And needless to say, </span>it is not nullified <span class="gemarra-regular">if one of them ratified </span>the vow.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that if the father nullified her vow and the husband did not nullify it, or if the husband nullified it and the father did not nullify it, then the vow is not nullified. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this </span>not the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>of the mishna, which states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Her father and her husband nullify her vows? </span>The Gemara answers: The second clause is necessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say: </span>The mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">either her father or her husband </span>can nullify her vows, but there is no need for both of them to do so, which is also a possible interpretation of the Hebrew phrase used. Therefore, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that it means that both of them must nullify the vow.
At the end of the mishna it is stated: <span class="gemarra-regular">And needless to say, </span>it is not nullified <span class="gemarra-regular">if one of them ratified </span>the vow. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Why do I </span>need the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">to teach </span>this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">was stated </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>of them <span class="gemarra-regular">nullified </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">without the other, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is nothing, </span>her vow is not nullified. If <span class="gemarra-regular">one of them ratified </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need it to state that her vow is not nullified? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary to teach </span>this?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It was necessary for </span>the mishna to mention this <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where one of them nullified </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one ratified </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the one who ratified </span>the woman’s vow <span class="gemarra-regular">retracted and requested </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">of his ratification </span>from a halakhic authority, who dissolved it. <span class="gemarra-regular">Lest you say: That which he ratified </span>is what <span class="gemarra-regular">he uprooted, </span>by asking the halakhic authority to dissolve his ratification, and therefore the vow is no more, the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us that they both must nullify </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">together</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
§ The mishna teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a betrothed young woman, her father and her husband nullify her vows. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do we </span>derive this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Since she is still in her father’s house, he should be authorized to nullify her vows by himself. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said: The verse states: “And if she be to a husband, and her vows are upon her…</span>But if her husband disallows her on the day that he hears it” (Numbers 30:7–9). <span class="gemarra-regular">From here </span>can be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a betrothed young woman that her father and her husband nullify her vows. </span>The Gemara asks: Is it not possible to <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this verse is written with regard to a married </span>woman?
The Gemara answers: No, <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>you say that it is written <span class="gemarra-regular">due to </span>a need to teach the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of <span class="gemarra-regular">a married woman, </span>it cannot be, as <span class="gemarra-regular">a different verse is written </span>for that purpose: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And if </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">vowed in her husband’s house” </span>(Numbers 30:11). The earlier verses therefore refer to a betrothed young woman, who is not yet in her husband’s house. The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">both </span>sets of verses are written <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a married woman. And if you would say: Why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">two verses </span>written <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a married woman? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">to say that the husband cannot nullify earlier </span>vows made before her marriage but only those made “in her husband’s house.” 

Daf 67b

The Gemara rejects this, stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">And do you not learn it by itself, </span>from the words “And if she vowed in her husband’s house” (Numbers 30:11)? As the verse indicates that her husband can nullify only vows made after the couple is fully married, and not those made beforehand, the earlier verse is unnecessary. 
The Gemara suggests an alternative method of demonstrating that the first verse is referring to a betrothed woman: Or <span class="gemarra-regular">if you wish, say that </span>the words “and if she be to a husband” (Numbers 30:7) must be referring to a betrothed woman, since the usage of the term <span class="gemarra-regular">“she be” indicates betrothal </span>rather than marriage.
The Gemara proposes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a father can nullify </span>the vows of his betrothed daughter <span class="gemarra-regular">on his own</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, why do I </span>need the verse to teach that in a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">she binds herself with a bond in her father’s house, </span>her father can <span class="gemarra-regular">disallow her, </span>i.e., nullify her vow (see Numbers 30:4–6). <span class="gemarra-regular">Now </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">it can be said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of a betrothed, </span>i.e., when she is betrothed, the <span class="gemarra-regular">father nullifies </span>his daughter’s vows <span class="gemarra-regular">on his own, is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">necessary </span>to state that he can do so <span class="gemarra-regular">where there is no</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> betrothed? </span>Therefore, the fact that the Torah specifically states that the father nullifies her vows by himself when she is not betrothed indicates that he does not have that power when she is betrothed.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the father requires the betrothed’s </span>participation in order to nullify his daughter’s vows <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the betrothed can nullify </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">on his own. And if you would say: </span>If the woman’s betrothed can nullify them on his own, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need the reference to the <span class="gemarra-regular">father</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that the Merciful One writes </span>with regard to the vows of a betrothed young woman, implying that the participation of the father is necessary to nullify her vows. One can explain that the need to mention the father <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary </span>in order to teach us <span class="gemarra-regular">that if </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">ratified </span>the vow, it is <span class="gemarra-regular">ratified, </span>and her betrothed can no longer nullify it.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, for what </span>purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">did </span>the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">write </span>“And if <span class="gemarra-regular">she vowed in her husband’s house” </span>(Numbers 30:11), which indicates that a married woman’s husband nullifies her vows on his own? That could be derived by <span class="gemarra-regular">an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference: <span class="gemarra-regular">If in the presence of the father, a betrothed man </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">nullifies </span>her vows <span class="gemarra-regular">on his own, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>she is <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>longer <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of the father, </span>i.e., she is married and no longer subject to his authority, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it necessary </span>to state that her husband nullifies her vows on his own?
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that the betrothed can nullify her vows by himself, and the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“And if she vowed in her husband’s house” </span>(Numbers 30:11) are in fact not necessary to teach that a fully married husband can nullify her vows on his own. Rather, they come <span class="gemarra-regular">to say, </span>i.e., to teach, <span class="gemarra-regular">that the husband cannot nullify </span>vows that <span class="gemarra-regular">preceded </span>the betrothal.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">But from that, </span>i.e., from the fact that the verse precludes only the full-fledged husband from nullifying vows that preceded the betrothal, one may infer that <span class="gemarra-regular">the betrothed can nullify </span>by himself vows that <span class="gemarra-regular">preceded </span>the betrothal. Such a conclusion is unreasonable, as the fully married man has greater authority over her than the betrothed. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>the case that the betrothed cannot nullify vows on his own, and his ability to do so is only <span class="gemarra-regular">because of his partnership with the father</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> 

Daf 68a

<span class="gemarra-regular">The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught </span>a different source for the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the mishna: The Torah states with regard to vows: “These are the statutes, which the Lord commanded Moses, <span class="gemarra-regular">between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, </span>being in her youth, in her father’s house” (Numbers 30:17). <span class="gemarra-regular">From here </span>it is derived <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a betrothed young woman that her father and her husband nullify her vows. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael, what does he do </span>with the words “and <span class="gemarra-regular">if she be to a husband” </span>(Numbers 30:7)? 
The Gemara answers: According to him, he <span class="gemarra-regular">establishes </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>teach the <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava </span>statement: If her betrothed died without ratifying the vow, her father can nullify it on his own. The Gemara then asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rava, </span>who derives the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the father and the betrothed of the young woman together nullify her vows from the phrase “and if she be to a husband” (Numbers 30:7), <span class="gemarra-regular">what does he do with this </span>verse <span class="gemarra-regular">that the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught </span>as the source for the father and the betrothed nullifying the young woman’s vows? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He requires that </span>phrase: “Between a man and his wife” (Numbers 30:17), in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to say that the husband can nullify </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">vows that are between him and her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., vows that negatively impact their marital relationship, but he cannot nullify any other type of vow. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: If <span class="gemarra-regular">a husband </span>nullifies his betrothed’s vow, does he <span class="gemarra-regular">seve</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> his share of the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>does he <span class="gemarra-regular">weaken </span>the force of the entire vow? The Gemara clarifies: Under <span class="gemarra-regular">which</span> circumstances <span class="gemarra-regular">do we raise the dilemma, </span>i.e., what is the practical difference between these two possibilities? In a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where she vowed </span>not to derive benefit <span class="gemarra-regular">from two olives</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothed heard and nullified </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for her, and </span>she <span class="gemarra-regular">ate those </span>two olives before her father nullified the vow, there is a practical difference.
<span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">severs </span>his share of the vow, nullifying half of the prohibition, then one of the olives remains completely forbidden, and she <span class="gemarra-regular">is flogged </span>for violating her vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">weakens </span>its force, she is not liable to be flogged, as eating the olives <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">merely a prohibition </span>that she has violated. If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the ruling with regard to this question?
The Gemara now cites a lengthy <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, ultimately stating a proof to answer the previous question. <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that will resolve the dilemma: <span class="gemarra-regular">When did they say </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">the husband </span>of a betrothed young woman <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">authority </span>to nullify her vows <span class="gemarra-regular">reverts to the father</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who can then nullify her vows on his own? This occurs in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">when the husband had not heard </span>her vow <span class="gemarra-regular">before he died; or </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he heard and was silent</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or where he heard and nullified </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and died on the same day. This is what we learned </span>in the mishna, concerning a case of this kind (70a): If <span class="gemarra-regular">the husband dies, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">authority </span>to nullify vows <span class="gemarra-regular">reverts to the father. </span>

Daf 68b

<span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>it is a case where the husband of a betrothed young woman <span class="gemarra-regular">heard and ratifie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">or where he heard, and was silent, and died on the following day, </span>in which case his silence is considered ratification of the vow, then the father <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot nullify </span>the vow.
If <span class="gemarra-regular">her father heard </span>or was made aware of the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">and nullified </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for her but the husband did not manage to hea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> of the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">before the father died, this is what we learned </span>in the same mishna (70a): If <span class="gemarra-regular">the father dies, the authority </span>over her vows <span class="gemarra-regular">does not revert to the husband</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a young woman’s betrothed cannot nullify her vows alone, without the father. If <span class="gemarra-regular">her husband heard </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">and nullifie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> it <span class="gemarra-regular">for her, and the father did not manage to hear </span>of the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">before the husband died</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> this is what we learned </span>in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">If the husband dies, the authority reverts to the father.</span>
If <span class="gemarra-regular">her husband heard and nullified </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for her, and the father did not manag</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to hear </span>of the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">before he died, the husband cannot nullify </span>it, although she no longer has a father, <span class="gemarra-regular">as the husband can nullify </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">only in partnershi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> with the father. 

Daf 69a

If <span class="gemarra-regular">her father heard and nullified </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and the husband did not manage to hear </span>of the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">before he died, the father may go back and nullif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">husband’s portion, </span>and that will complete the nullification of her vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan said: This </span>last ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">is the statement of Beit Shammai, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hille</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he cannot nullif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> only the husband’s share of the vow but must also nullify his own share again. 
Having completed its citation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the Gemara now states its proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from this </span>that, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai, </span>whoever nullifies the vow first completely <span class="gemarra-regular">severs </span>his half of the vow, and therefore the father needed only to nullify the part left by the husband. However, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel, </span>his nullification <span class="gemarra-regular">weaken</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> the general force of the vow, so the father’s subsequent nullification must address the whole vow. The Gemara rules: <span class="gemarra-regular">Conclude from this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that the husband’s nullification weakens the general force of the vow, as the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with Beit Hillel.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raises a dilemma: Is there </span>the possibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">a request </span>to a halakhic authority <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>dissolving the <span class="gemarra-regular">ratification </span>of one’s wife’s vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">or is there no </span>possibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">a request </span>to a halakhic authority <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>dissolving his <span class="gemarra-regular">ratification </span>of one’s wife’s vow? One might seek to dissolve one’s ratification if he now desires to nullify the vow. Furthermore, <span class="gemarra-regular">if you say </span>that there is the possibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">a request to </span>dissolve his <span class="gemarra-regular">ratification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is there </span>the possibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">a request </span>to a halakhic authority <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>dissolving <span class="gemarra-regular">nullification </span>of his wife’s vow, to allow him to ratify the vow in place of nullifying it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or is there no </span>possibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">a request to </span>dissolve the <span class="gemarra-regular">nullification </span>of his wife’s vow?
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rabbi Yoḥanan says: </span>A halakhic authority <span class="gemarra-regular">may be requested to </span>dissolve <span class="gemarra-regular">ratificatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of one’s wife’s vow <span class="gemarra-regular">but may not be requested to </span>dissolve <span class="gemarra-regular">nullification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba asks: </span>If, after hearing one’s wife or one’s daughter’s vow, one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is ratified for you, it is ratified for you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>then a halakhic authority <span class="gemarra-regular">was requested about the first ratification </span>and dissolved it, but one did not request dissolution of the second ratification, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is the second ratification in force, or is it irrelevant, as it was performed on an vow that was already ratified and consequently never took effect? 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rava said </span>with regard to one who said: I take an oath that I will not eat, I take an oath that I will not eat: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>a halakhic authority <span class="gemarra-regular">was requested to </span>dissolve <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span>oath and dissolved it, the <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>oath <span class="gemarra-regular">goes into effect for him</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Similarly, the second ratification goes into effect. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">asks: </span>If he said to her: The vow is <span class="gemarra-regular">ratified for you and nullifie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for you, and the ratification will not take effect unless the nullification takes effect, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? 

Daf 69b

The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution of this dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">from the dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei, as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Temura</span> 25b): If one said about an animal: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is hereby a substitute for a burnt-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> a substitute for a peace-offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">it becomes a substitute </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">for a burnt-offering; </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Meir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who holds that one’s initial statement is determinant. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei says: If this is what he intended from the outset, </span>that it should be a substitute for both a burnt-offering and a peace-offering, then <span class="gemarra-regular">since it is impossible to give it two names at once </span>and he could not have said burnt-offering and peace-offering simultaneously, <span class="gemarra-regular">his statement is effective</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and the animal is a substitute for both of them at once. Similarly, it is possible for him to intend to both ratify and nullify the vow and the vow is nullified, despite the fact that his first statement was to ratify it. 
The Gemara adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">And even Rabbi Meir says </span>that the first part of one’s statement is determinant only <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did not state: This will not take effect unless this </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">takes effect. Here, however, where he </span>expressly <span class="gemarra-regular">said: The ratification </span>of the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">will not take effect unless the nullification takes effect, even Rabbi Meir concedes that the nullification takes effect</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba </span>further <span class="gemarra-regular">asks: </span>If he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is ratified and nullified for you simultaneously</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">which Rabba </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Any </span>two halakhic statuses <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>able to implement <span class="gemarra-regular">sequentiall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not </span>realized <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>when one attempts to bring them about <span class="gemarra-regular">simultaneously. </span>Since one cannot ratify a vow and subsequently nullify it, one can also not ratify and nullify a vow simultaneously.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba raises </span>another <span class="gemarra-regular">dilemma: </span>If one says to his wife or daughter: Your vow <span class="gemarra-regular">is ratified for you today</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that he is <span class="gemarra-regular">like one who said to her: It is nullified for you tomorrow? Or perhaps, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">say to her </span>that the vow is nullified, it remains in force. 

Daf 70a

<span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that since <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">say to her </span>that the vow is nullified, this means that it remains in force, then if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to her: It is nullified for you tomorrow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">on the following day he cannot nullify </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he has </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">ratified the vow today, </span>in that he did not nullify it “on the day that he hears it” (Numbers 30:8)? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps, since he did not </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">say to her: It is ratified for you today, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">when he says to her: It is nullified for you tomorrow, he is </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">saying </span>that the nullification begins <span class="gemarra-regular">from today, </span>so that the vow is nullified.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say: Nevertheless, since he ratified it today, </span>as he said that it is nullified only tomorrow, <span class="gemarra-regular">on the following day it is considered </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">in force </span>and he cannot nullify it, then if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to her: It is ratified for you </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">an hour</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">like one who said to her: It is nullified for you after an hour </span>has passed? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps, </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not say </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">to her </span>explicitly, it is not nullified?
<span class="gemarra-regular">If you say that </span>since <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not say </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">to her </span>explicitly, therefore the vow is not nullified after an hour, <span class="gemarra-regular">still, </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>explicitly <span class="gemarra-regular">said to her </span>that it is nullified after an hour, <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Do we say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">since he has ratified this </span>vow, in that he explicitly withheld nullification for an hour, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has ratified it </span>and can no longer nullify it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or, perhaps since the entire day is valid for ratification and valid for nullification, when he says: It is nullified for you after an hour, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">is effective.</span>
The Gemara cites a mishna (<span class="it-text">Nazir</span> 20b) to resolve this last question: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear: </span>If a woman said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby a nazirite, and her husband heard </span>her vow <span class="gemarra-regular">and said: And I</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> meaning that he intends to become a nazirite as well, <span class="gemarra-regular">he can no </span>longer <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify </span>his wife’s vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">And why </span>not? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say that </span>the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">And I, that he said </span>referred <span class="gemarra-regular">to himself, that he should be a nazirite. But her </span>vow of: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby a nazirite, </span>exists for one hour, i.e., the time until the husband took his own vow based on hers. <span class="gemarra-regular">After an hour, if he wants to nullify </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">why can he not nullify </span>it? Is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not because once he has ratified it </span>by basing his vow on hers, even for one hour, <span class="gemarra-regular">he has ratified it </span>permanently and can no longer nullify it? The Gemara rejects this suggestion. <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>that is not the explanation. The <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of that mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone </span>who says the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">And I</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> in response to his wife’s vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">is like one who says</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> It is ratified for you forever. </span>All the aforementioned questions are therefore left unresolved.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">the father </span>of a betrothed young woman <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">authority does not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">rever</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">to the husband, </span>and the husband cannot nullify the young woman’s vows by himself. However, if <span class="gemarra-regular">the husband </span><span class="gemarra-regular">dies</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> his <span class="gemarra-regular">authority reverts to the father, </span>who can now nullify her vows on his own. <span class="gemarra-regular">In this </span>matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">the power of the father is enhanced relative to the power of the husband.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">In another matter, the power of the husband is enhance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> relative to the power of the father, as the husband nullifies </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">during </span>the woman’s <span class="gemarra-regular">adulthood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> once they are fully married, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas the father does not nullify </span>her vows <span class="gemarra-regular">during </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">adulthood</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">reason</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., what is the source for the fact that the authority over the young woman’s vows does not revert to the husband if her father dies? The source is <span class="gemarra-regular">that the verse states: “Being in her youth, in her father’s house” </span>(Numbers 30:17). As long as she is a young woman “in her youth,” she is considered to be “in her father’s house” and under his jurisdiction, even if she is betrothed. Even if her father passes away, she is still considered to be in his house, and her betrothed does not assume authority over her vows.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do we </span>derive that if <span class="gemarra-regular">the husband died </span>his <span class="gemarra-regular">authority reverts to the father</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabba said: </span>We derive it from the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that the verse states: “And if she be [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">hayo</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">tihyeh</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] to a husband, and her vows are upon her” </span>(Numbers 30:7). The phrase <span class="it-text">hayo</span> <span class="it-text">tihyeh</span> is a doubled usage of the verb to be. The Gemara understands this as referring to two different instances of being betrothed to a man, e.g., the woman’s first betrothed dies and then she is betrothed to another man. 

Daf 70b

This verse <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposes </span>the vows <span class="gemarra-regular">preceding </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>instance of <span class="gemarra-regular">being </span>betrothed, i.e., those that she took after her first husband’s death but before her second betrothal, <span class="gemarra-regular">to those </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">preceding </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>instance of <span class="gemarra-regular">being </span>betrothed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with regard to the vows <span class="gemarra-regular">preceding </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span>instance of <span class="gemarra-regular">being </span>betrothed, her <span class="gemarra-regular">father nullifies </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">on his own, so too, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">preceding </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">second </span>instance of <span class="gemarra-regular">being </span>betrothed, her <span class="gemarra-regular">father nullifies </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">on his own.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">halakha</span> that the father nullifies vows on his own after the death of the betrothed <span class="gemarra-regular">applies </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">to vows that were not disclosed to the betrothed, </span>i.e., those that he did not have the opportunity to either ratify or nullify, <span class="gemarra-regular">but with regard to vows that were disclosed to the betrothed, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">father cannot nullify </span>them on his own.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the verse is referring only <span class="gemarra-regular">to vows that were not disclosed to the betrothed, </span>it would be unnecessary to teach that <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, as that <span class="gemarra-regular">is derived from </span>the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“being in her youth, in her father’s house” </span>(Numbers 30:17). As long as the young woman is in her father’s house, even after the death of her betrothed, her father has the authority to nullify her vows.
§ The mishna states: <span class="gemarra-regular">In this </span>matter, <span class="gemarra-regular">the power of the father is enhanced relative to the power of the husband. </span>In another matter, the power of the husband is enhanced relative to the power of the father, as the husband nullifies vows during the woman’s adulthood, whereas the father does not nullify vows during her adulthood. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances</span> under which a husband can nullify his adult wife’s vows?
<span class="gemarra-regular">If we say </span>that the mishna is referring to a cases <span class="gemarra-regular">where he betrothed her when she was a young woman, </span>and she took a vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">she reached majority, </span>that cannot be the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">After all, </span>both the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>of her father <span class="gemarra-regular">removes her </span>from the father’s authority <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>attaining her <span class="gemarra-regular">majority removes her from the father’s authority, </span>so the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> in the two cases should be the same. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as </span>with the <span class="gemarra-regular">death </span>of the father, his <span class="gemarra-regular">authority does not revert to the husband </span>and the woman’s betrothed cannot nullify her vows on his own, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>upon attaining <span class="gemarra-regular">majority </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">authority </span>the father possessed when she was a young woman <span class="gemarra-regular">does not rever</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to the husband.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>it is referring to a case in <span class="gemarra-regular">which he betrothed her when she was a grown woman, </span>and then she took a vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">The Gemara asks: Didn’t we </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">learn </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">on another occasion, </span>in a later mishna that states (73b): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a grown woman who waited twelve month</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> after her betrothal and then requested that her betrothed marry her, Rabbi Eliezer says: Since her husband is already obligated to provide for her sustenance, as he is obligated to have married her by then, he can nullify her vows by himself, as if he were fully married to her.
The Gemara explains the cited mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>cited mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is itself difficult: You said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a grown woman who waited twelve </span>months is entitled to support. <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to a grown woman, why do I </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">twelve-month </span>waiting period before her betrothed is obligated to marry her? For <span class="gemarra-regular">a grown woman, thirty days suffice for her </span>to prepare what she needs for her marriage after she is betrothed. The Gemara answers: The mishna should be revised. <span class="gemarra-regular">Teach </span>the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">A grown woman </span>who waited thirty days <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a young woman <span class="gemarra-regular">who waited twelve months.</span>
The Gemara returns to the question: <span class="gemarra-regular">In any case, </span>the fact that the mishna here teaches a <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that is addressed in a different mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">difficult. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you wish, say </span>that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">here </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">actually </span>the primary source of this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">a grown woman is taught there because </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">wants </span>to present how <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis disagree.</span>
Alternatively, <span class="gemarra-regular">if you wish, say </span>that the mishna that begins: <span class="gemarra-regular">A grown woman, </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">actually </span>the source for this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>. The mishna here repeats the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> incidentally, <span class="gemarra-regular">since it needs to cite the first clause: In this </span>matter the power of the father is enhanced relative to the power of the husband, therefore the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">cites </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">latter clause </span>as well, by writing: <span class="gemarra-regular">In this </span>other matter, the power of the husband is enhanced relative to the power of the father. 

Daf 71a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <span class="gemarra-regular">she took a vow as a betrothed woma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> and then <span class="gemarra-regular">was divorced on the same day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">she was </span>again <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothed on the same da</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> to another man, or <span class="gemarra-regular">even to one hundred </span>men, one after the other, on a single day, <span class="gemarra-regular">her father and her last husband nullify her vows. This is the principle: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>young woman <span class="gemarra-regular">who has not left </span>her father’s jurisdiction and entered <span class="gemarra-regular">into her own jurisdiction for </span>at least <span class="gemarra-regular">one moment, </span>through full marriage or reaching majority, <span class="gemarra-regular">her father and her final husband nullify her vows.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">From where do we </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">final betrothed can nullify </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">vows that were disclosed to the first betrothed? Shmuel said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “And if she be to a husband and her vows are upon </span>her…and he nullifies her vow” (Numbers 30:7–9), indicating that he can nullify <span class="gemarra-regular">vows that were upon her already. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps this statement applies </span>only to vows <span class="gemarra-regular">that were not discerned by the first betrothed, but vows that were discerned by the first betrothed,</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">final betrothed cannot nullify.</span>
The Gemara answers: The phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“upon her” is a superfluous </span>part of the <span class="gemarra-regular">verse. </span>One can derive from it that all her vows, including those of which an earlier betrothed had been aware, can be nullified by the final betrothed. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Shmuel</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a betrothed young woman, her father and her husband </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify her vows. How so? </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">her father heard and nullifie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for her, and the husband did not manage to hear </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">before he died, and she was betrothed on the same da</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> to another man, <span class="gemarra-regular">or even one hundred times </span>on the same day, <span class="gemarra-regular">her father and her final husband nullify her vows. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">her husband heard and nullified </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for her, and the father did not manage to hear </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">before the husband died, the father may go back and nullif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">husband’s portion. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan said: This is the statement of Beit Shammai, </span>that each of them nullifies half of the betrothed young woman’s vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, Beit Hillel say </span>that the father <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot nullify </span>the vow on his own. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">About what </span>do Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <span class="gemarra-regular">disagree? </span>

Daf 71b

The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai hold: Even </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that were disclosed to the betrothed, </span>in the event of his death, his <span class="gemarra-regular">authority reverts to the father. </span>In addition, when the father or husband of a young woman nullifies her vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">he severs </span>his portion of it, enabling the father to nullify her vow on his own after the death of the betrothed. <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Hillel hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">her father and her final husband </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify her vows, and he </span>who nullifies her vow <span class="gemarra-regular">does not sever </span>it, but rather weakens its force. Even if the first betrothed was aware of the vow before his death, the father can nullify it in conjunction with another betrothed. This ruling is in accordance with the ruling of Shmuel that her final betrothed can nullify even those vows that she took while betrothed to the first man.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: Is a husband’s <span class="gemarra-regular">divorce </span>of his wife after she took a vow considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like silence</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>is it considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like ratificatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of the vow? 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">difference </span>between the two possibilities? In any case, he did not nullify her vow before the divorce, and once he has divorced her he can no longer do so. The Gemara answers: There is a difference <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where she took a vow, and her husband heard </span>the vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">and divorced her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he remarried her on the same day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If the Master says </span>that divorce is <span class="gemarra-regular">like silence, </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can </span>now <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> since it is the same day. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if the Master says </span>that divorce is <span class="gemarra-regular">like ratification, he cannot nullify </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for her, </span>as he has ratified it by divorcing her. 

Daf 72a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution of the dilemma from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">When did they say </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">the husband die</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">authority </span>to nullify a young woman’s vows <span class="gemarra-regular">reverts to the father? When the husband did not hear </span>the vow; <span class="gemarra-regular">or he heard </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">and nullified </span>it; <span class="gemarra-regular">or heard </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and was silent, and died on that day. And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">divorce is like silence, let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">also teac</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> with regard to the husband: <span class="gemarra-regular">Or he heard </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">and divorced </span>her. <span class="gemarra-regular">From </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that he did not teach this </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">divorce is like ratification.</span>
The Gemara rejects the proof from the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">State the latter clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if he heard </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and ratified </span>it; <span class="gemarra-regular">or he heard </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and was silent, and died on the following day, </span>then the father <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot nullify </span>the vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according to this clause, <span class="gemarra-regular">if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">divorce is like ratification, let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> also <span class="gemarra-regular">teach: And if he heard </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">and divorced </span>her. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, from </span>the fact <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">does not teach this, learn from </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">divorce is like silence. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, one cannot learn </span>anything <span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> about the effect of divorce on her vows. The Gemara explains that the discrepancy between the two clauses is stylistic and can be explained either way: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the cases in <span class="gemarra-regular">the first clause </span>are chosen <span class="gemarra-regular">precisely</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> allowing for the inference that divorce is like ratification, then one must say that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">formulates the last clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as he does <span class="gemarra-regular">because of the first clause, </span>i.e., in the same style, although it does not add anything. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the cases in <span class="gemarra-regular">the last clause </span>are chosen <span class="gemarra-regular">precisely, </span>allowing for the inference that divorce is like silence, then one must say that the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">formulates the first clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> as he does <span class="gemarra-regular">because of the last clause, </span>i.e., in the same style, although it does not add anything. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a mishna (71a): If <span class="gemarra-regular">she took a vow </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">she was betrothed, and was divorced, and was betrothed </span>again <span class="gemarra-regular">on the same day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> even to one hundred </span>men, <span class="gemarra-regular">her father and her final husband nullify her vows. Learn from </span>this mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">divorce is like silence, because if </span>it were <span class="gemarra-regular">like ratification, could the final betrothed nullify vows that </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">first betrothed had </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">ratified?</span>
The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing here? </span>We are dealing with a case <span class="gemarra-regular">in which the first betrothed man did not hear </span>the vow, and for that reason his divorcing her does not constitute ratification. The Gemara then asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, why </span>mention <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>that the divorce occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">on that day? The same would hold true even after one hundred day</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as well. </span>Since the first husband never heard the vow, the final husband can nullify it on whichever day he hears it.
The Gemara answers: It is referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">in which </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothed </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">did not hea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">but the father heard </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span>in that case, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">on the same day that he can nullif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> the vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">but he cannot nullify </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">forward. </span>Once her father has already heard the vow, her betrothed cannot nullify it on a different day. Therefore, one cannot infer from the mishna that divorce is like silence. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution of the dilemma from a mishna (89a): If <span class="gemarra-regular">she took a vow on that day, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">he divorced her and remarried her on the same day, he cannot nullify </span>her vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from </span>the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">divorce is like ratification.</span>
The Gemara rejects this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">here, </span>i.e., in the mishna cited, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing with a married woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and that is the reason that he canno</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nullify </span>the vow. It is not because it has been ratified by divorce but <span class="gemarra-regular">because the husband cannot nullify </span>his wife’s vows <span class="gemarra-regular">that precede </span>their marriage. The dilemma remains unresolved. 

Daf 72b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">The practice of Torah scholar</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> is to ensure that a woman about to be married should not be encumbered by any vows. A father, <span class="gemarra-regular">before his daughter would leave him </span>through marriage, <span class="gemarra-regular">would say to her: All vows that you vowed in my house are hereby nullified. And similarly, the husband, before she would enter his jurisdiction, </span>i.e., while they were still betrothed, <span class="gemarra-regular">would say to her: All vows that you vowed before you entered my jurisdiction are hereby nullified. </span>This was necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">because once she enters his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">jurisdiction</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he cannot nullify </span>the vows she made before that.
gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama asks: </span>Concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a husband, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard </span>to his <span class="gemarra-regular">nullifyin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">without hearing </span>it? In other words, can a husband state a general nullification of his wife’s vows without being aware of any particular vow? When the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And her husband hears </span>it, on the day that he hears it, and holds his peace at her, then her vows shall be ratified” (Numbers 30:8), <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>that referring <span class="gemarra-regular">specificall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> to a situation where he actually heard of a vow, and only then he can nullify it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or is </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">not specifically </span>referring to such a situation, and the mention of hearing is merely because the ordinary situation is that the husband nullifies a vow once he hears it? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">The practice of Torah scholars </span>is that a father, <span class="gemarra-regular">before his daughter would leave him </span>through marriage, <span class="gemarra-regular">would say to her: All vows that you vowed in my house are hereby nullified. </span>Rava points out: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>the father <span class="gemarra-regular">did not hear </span>her vows, so it must be that one can nullify vows without knowledge that they were actually made.
The Gemara rejects this conclusion: The mishna means that the father states a preemptive nullification that <span class="gemarra-regular">when he </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a particular vow <span class="gemarra-regular">is when he nullifies </span>it. The vow is not actually nullified until he hears it. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, when he has not </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">heard </span>those vows yet, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>is it necessary <span class="gemarra-regular">for him to state </span>preemptively that the vows will be nullified; why not wait until he actually hears the vow? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">This teaches us </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">the practice of a Torah scholar to pursu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> such matters, in order to prompt his daughter or his betrothed to inform him of vows she took, which will then be nullified when he hears of them.
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear from the latter clause </span>of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">And similarly, the husband, before she would enter his jurisdiction, </span>i.e., while they were still betrothed, <span class="gemarra-regular">would say to her: </span>All vows that you vowed before you entered my jurisdiction are hereby nullified. This implies that he can nullify vows without hearing them. The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>it means <span class="gemarra-regular">that he says to her: When I hea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> the particular vow, then it will be nullified.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>another mishna to answer the question (<span class="it-text">Nedarim</span> 75a): <span class="gemarra-regular">One who says to his wife: All vows that you vow until I arrive from such and such a place are hereby ratified, has not said anything</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the vows are not ratified. If he says: All vows that you vow until then <span class="gemarra-regular">are hereby nullified, Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>They are <span class="gemarra-regular">nullified. </span>The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he did not </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">hea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> the particular vows, so one can infer from this that he need not hear her vows in order to nullify them.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>one can understand the situation to be <span class="gemarra-regular">that he says: When I hear </span>the particular vow, it will be nullified. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">why do I </span>need, i.e., why must the husband state his nullification, <span class="gemarra-regular">from now; let him nullify </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">for her when he </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">hears </span>them. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He reasons: Perhaps I will be preoccupied at that moment </span>and will forget to nullify them. He therefore nullifies the vows beforehand, so that the nullification will take effect automatically when he hears them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who says to a steward [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">apotropos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> appointed to manage his affairs in his absence: <span class="gemarra-regular">All vows that my wife vows from now until I arrive from such and such a place </span>you should <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify, and </span>the steward <span class="gemarra-regular">nullified </span>the vows for <span class="gemarra-regular">her, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought that <span class="gemarra-regular">they would be nullified. </span>Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “Her husband may ratify it, or her husband may nullify it” </span>(Numbers 30:14). The repetition of “her husband” teaches that it is the husband alone who may nullify his wife’s vows; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yonatan said to him: We have found everywhere in the Torah </span>that the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person’s agent is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">himself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, a steward can nullify the vows on the husband’s behalf. 
The Gemara points out: <span class="gemarra-regular">And even Rabbi Yoshiya says </span>that a steward cannot nullify the wife’s vows <span class="gemarra-regular">only because it is a Torah edict, </span>based upon the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“her husband </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may ratify it, or her husband may nullify it” </span>(Numbers 30:14). <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>according <span class="gemarra-regular">to everyone, </span>the principle that the legal status of <span class="gemarra-regular">a person’s agent is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">himself </span>is generally valid. The only objection to the steward nullifying the vows is the Torah edict. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>these vows <span class="gemarra-regular">were not heard by </span>the steward? This indicates that not having heard the vows is not an obstacle to nullification. 

Daf 73a

The Gemara rejects this conclusion as well: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">in which </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">says to </span>the steward: <span class="gemarra-regular">When I hear </span>the vow, then it <span class="gemarra-regular">will be nullified for her. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let him nullify </span>the vows <span class="gemarra-regular">for her when he </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">hears </span>them. Why do so earlier? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">He reasons: Perhaps I will be preoccupied </span>at that moment and will forget to nullify them. The questions pertaining to nullification of vows without hearing them is left unresolved.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rami bar Ḥama asks: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a deaf man, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to his nullifyin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> vows <span class="gemarra-regular">for his wife</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> If you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a husband </span>who is not deaf <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">without hearing </span>it, then perhaps this is <span class="gemarra-regular">because he is capable of hearing. But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a deaf man, who is not capable of hearing, </span>perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>an application of the principle derived from the statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Zeira.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rabbi Zeira said: </span>For <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>amount of flour <span class="gemarra-regular">suitable for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">minglin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> with oil in a meal-offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">mingling is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">indispensable for it. </span>Even though it is a mitzva to mingle the flour and oil <span class="it-text">ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span>, if they were not mingled, the meal-offering is still valid. <span class="gemarra-regular">But</span> for <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>amount of flour <span class="gemarra-regular">not suitable for mingling, mingling is indispensable for it,</span> and such a meal-offering is invalid. The principle is: <span class="it-text">Ab</span> <span class="it-text">initio</span> requirements prevent the fulfillment of a mitzva in situations where they are not merely absent but impossible. In this case, the deaf man does not merely not hear the vow, it is impossible for him to do so. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“and her husband hears it” </span>(Numbers 30:8) <span class="gemarra-regular">does not </span>mean that hearing <span class="gemarra-regular">is indispensable </span>to the nullification of a vow, so that even a deaf man can nullify his wife’s vows. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> interpreting that verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And her husband hears it”; </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">excludes the wife of a deaf man</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that a deaf man cannot nullify his wife’s vows.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: Concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">a husband, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to nullifying </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">for his two wive</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> simultaneously</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Do the words “but if her husband disallows <span class="gemarra-regular">her </span>on the day that he hears it, and he nullifies her vow which is upon her” (Numbers 30:9), stated in the singular, refer <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>to one wife? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or, </span>perhaps it does <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>refer <span class="gemarra-regular">specifically </span>to one wife, and a husband can nullify the vows of more than one wife simultaneously.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the <span class="it-text">sota</span> ritual, performed by women suspected by their husbands of having committed adultery, <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">sot</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">women are not given to drin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">k</span> the bitter waters <span class="gemarra-regular">as one. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">because the heart </span>of each becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">emboldened </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">g</span><span class="gemarra-italic">as</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the </span>presence of <span class="gemarra-regular">the other </span>woman, and if one is guilty she will lack the humility to confess.

If the end of the <span class="gemarra-regular">twelve-month </span>period <span class="gemarra-regular">arrived</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> even if he has not married her, she <span class="gemarra-regular">partakes of his food, </span>i.e., he is obligated to provide for her. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>if she was betrothed to a priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">she partakes of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> like a priest’s wife. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, a man, </span>i.e., a priest, <span class="gemarra-regular">whose married brother died childless [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yavam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">does not enable </span>the woman awaiting levirate marriage to him <span class="gemarra-regular">to partake of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">terum</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> until they are actually married.
If the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">completed six months </span>of awaiting marriage <span class="gemarra-regular">under the aegis of the husband, </span>and he died, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>then she completed <span class="gemarra-regular">six months under the aegis of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yavam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">; or even </span>if she <span class="gemarra-regular">completed all of those </span>months <span class="gemarra-regular">under the aegis of the husband</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> less one day; or all of them under the aegis of the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yavam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> less one day, she may not partake of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. This is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">initial </span>version of the <span class="gemarra-regular">mishna. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">a court </span>that convened <span class="gemarra-regular">after them, </span>in a later generation, said: <span class="gemarra-regular">The woman may not partake of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">terum</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">until she enters the </span>marriage <span class="gemarra-regular">canopy, </span>thereby finalizing the marriage. Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion that her husband can nullify her vows after the completion of the period allotted after the betrothal follows the initial version, which requires the husband to support her from that point forward. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: Perhaps it is not so. The initial </span>version of the <span class="gemarra-regular">mishna teaches us only about </span>the permissibility of her <span class="gemarra-regular">partaking of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span> whose status is <span class="gemarra-regular">by rabbinic</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">vows, </span>whose prohibitions have the force of <span class="gemarra-regular">Torah law, say </span>that her betrothed <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot </span>nullify them.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>perhaps <span class="gemarra-regular">you did not hear Rabbi Eliezer </span>state his opinion that a betrothed woman is regarded as married <span class="gemarra-regular">only with regard to vows. </span>Perhaps Rabbi Eliezer holds <span class="gemarra-regular">like that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pineḥa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> said <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rava, who said: Any </span>woman <span class="gemarra-regular">who takes a vow, takes a vow </span>contingent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon the consent of her husband, </span>since he provides her sustenance. Perhaps Rabbi Eliezer grants her betrothed authority over her vows only because she vows with his consent in mind, since he is now obligated to provide for her. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>Rabbi Eliezer might hold that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if it is <span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by rabbinic law, she may not partake </span>of it. 

Daf 74a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a widow waiting for her </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yava</span><span class="gemarra-italic">m</span> to perform levirate marriage, <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>she is waiting <span class="gemarra-regular">for one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yavam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>if her late husband had only one brother, or <span class="gemarra-regular">whether </span>she is waiting <span class="gemarra-regular">for two </span>or more <span class="gemarra-italic">yevamin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>if he had several brothers, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>A <span class="it-text">yavam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>her vows. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua says: </span>If she is waiting <span class="gemarra-regular">for one </span><span class="it-text">yavam</span>, he can nullify her vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>if she is waiting <span class="gemarra-regular">for two</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Akiva says: </span>A <span class="it-text">yavam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot </span>nullify her vows, regardless of whether she is waiting <span class="gemarra-regular">for one </span><span class="it-text">yavam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or for two </span>or more.
The mishna then elaborates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer said: Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman he acquired for himself </span>through betrothal, <span class="gemarra-regular">he nullifies her vows, </span>so too with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman acquired for him from Heaven, </span>i.e., the <span class="it-text">yevama</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it logical that he should </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify her vows?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva said to him: No, if you say </span>that a husband can nullify the vows of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman he acquired for himself, over whom others have no authority, shall you </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that this is the case with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman acquired for him from Heaven, over whom others have authority? </span>If there are two <span class="it-text">yevamin</span>, each <span class="it-text">yavam</span> has equal authority with regard to her vows.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: Akiva, your statement applies </span>in a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">with two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yevamin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">how do you reply </span>to Rabbi Eliezer <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yavam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: A </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yevama</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not the full-fledged </span>wife <span class="gemarra-regular">of</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yavam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in the in the way that a betrothed woman </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">her husband’s full-fledged </span>wife, and the <span class="it-text">yavam</span> is not empowered to nullify vows at all. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The latter two opinions in the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">make sense: Rabbi Akiva holds </span>that the levirate <span class="gemarra-regular">bon</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is not substantial. </span>Since the obligation of levirate marriage does not create a marriage-like bond between the <span class="it-text">yavam</span> and the <span class="it-text">yevama</span>, a <span class="it-text">yavam</span> cannot nullify the vows of the <span class="it-text">yevama</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yehoshua holds </span>that the levirate <span class="gemarra-regular">bond is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">substantial</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> so that if there is only one <span class="it-text">yavam</span>, the <span class="it-text">yevama</span> is considered his wife, allowing him to nullify her vows. <span class="gemarra-regular">However, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, what is his reason? </span>Even <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>he holds that the levirate <span class="gemarra-regular">bond </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is substantial, there is, </span>nevertheless, <span class="gemarra-regular">no </span>retroactive <span class="gemarra-regular">designation</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since it has not yet been established which of them will be her husband, how can either of them nullify her vows? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ami said: </span>It is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>one <span class="it-text">yavam</span> has already <span class="gemarra-regular">performed levirate betrotha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with her.</span> According to Beit Hillel, levirate betrothal does not have the full force of a regular betrothal, <span class="gemarra-regular">but</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Eliezer holds like Beit Shammai, who say: Levirate betrothal effects a full-fledged acquisition </span>just like a regular betrothal.
<span class="gemarra-regular">But Rabbi Yehoshua </span>would <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you, </span>Rabbi Eliezer, in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">That </span>statement, that <span class="gemarra-regular">levirate </span>betrothal effects a full-fledged acquisition, <span class="gemarra-regular">applies </span>only to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">with one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yavam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, but with two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yevamin</span> it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>so. The Gemara explains why it cannot be a full-fledged acquisition where there is more than one <span class="it-text">yavam</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is there anythin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> like this sort of betrothal that <span class="gemarra-regular">when his brother comes, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">can render </span>the betrothed woman <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden to </span>the one who performed levirate betrothal <span class="gemarra-regular">by </span>engaging in <span class="gemarra-regular">sexual intercourse </span>with the <span class="it-text">yevama</span>, thereby performing levirate marriage, <span class="gemarra-regular">or by </span>giving her <span class="gemarra-regular">a bill of divorce, </span>thereby disqualifying her from levirate marriage, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>nevertheless the betrothed <span class="gemarra-regular">can </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify </span>her vows? Since this betrothal can in essence be nullified, it cannot be viewed as betrothal with regard to nullification of vows. Rabbi Ami completes his analysis: <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Akiva holds </span>that the levirate <span class="gemarra-regular">bond is not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> substantial </span>at all, and there is no marital bond between a <span class="it-text">yevama</span> and her <span class="it-text">yavam</span> until the levirate marriage is consummated.
The Gemara challenges Rabbi Ami’s interpretation of the dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to </span>the <span class="it-text">amora</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Elazar, who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">levirate betrothal, according to Beit Shammai, does not effect </span>a full-fledged <span class="gemarra-regular">acquisition except </span>in that it <span class="gemarra-regular">removes a rival wif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> from being considered substantially bound to the <span class="it-text">yavam</span> while she is a <span class="it-text">yevama</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">what can be said? </span>Only the relatives of the betrothed <span class="it-text">yevama</span> are then forbidden to the <span class="it-text">yavam</span>.
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here we </span><span class="gemarra-regular">are dealing with </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the <span class="it-text">yavam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">stood </span>in court <span class="gemarra-regular">in judgmen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> after the woman demanded that he marry her <span class="gemarra-regular">and he was obligated </span>by the court to provide <span class="gemarra-regular">her sustenance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>that which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pineḥas </span>stated <span class="gemarra-regular">in the name of Rava, who said: Any </span>woman <span class="gemarra-regular">who vows, </span>that which <span class="gemarra-regular">she vows </span>is contingent <span class="gemarra-regular">upon her husband’s consent. </span>Since under these circumstances the <span class="it-text">yavam</span> must provide for the <span class="it-text">yevama</span> he betrothed, he is authorized to nullify her vows. 

Daf 74b

The Gemara raises a difficulty with Rabbi Ami’s explanation of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion: <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer said: Just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman he acquired for himself </span>through betrothal, <span class="gemarra-regular">he nullifies her vows, </span>so too with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman acquired for him from Heaven</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., the <span class="it-text">yevama</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it logical that he should </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify her vows? Now if </span>Rabbi Ami’s interpretation is correct, and the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>a <span class="it-text">yavam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">performed levirate betrothal, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>is actually a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">he acquired </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">for himself </span>by performing levirate betrothal. The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, it is a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he acquired for himself </span>a woman who was imposed upon him <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of Heaven.</span>
The Gemara raises another difficulty with Rabbi Ami’s interpretation, in that if it is correct, <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">resolve </span>the dilemma <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rabba raised: </span>Does <span class="gemarra-regular">levirate betrothal, according to Beit Shammai, </span>merely <span class="gemarra-regular">effect betrothal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or does it effect </span>full-fledged <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage? </span>According to Rabbi Eliezer, <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">resolve </span>the dilemma by proving <span class="gemarra-regular">that it effects marriage. </span>The proof is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because if </span>levirate betrothal <span class="gemarra-regular">effects </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">betrothal, </span>why does the mishna mention only the <span class="it-text">yavam</span> with regard to nullification of vows? <span class="gemarra-regular">Didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Nedarim</span> 66b) that with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a betrothed young woman, her father and her husband </span>together <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify her vows? </span>If levirate betrothal renders her betrothed to the <span class="it-text">yavam</span>, the father should also be mentioned as a partner in the nullification.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: </span>This does not resolve the dilemma, as <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>could be the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify </span>in the mishna? It could mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">he nullifies </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">in partnership </span>with the father.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is also taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>Rabbi Eliezer is addressing a case where levirate betrothal has been performed, <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ami: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a widow awaiting her </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yavam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, whether </span>she is waiting for <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yavam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>if her late husband had only one brother, or for <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>or more <span class="gemarra-italic">yevamin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, Rabbi Eliezer says: </span>The <span class="it-text">yavam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>her vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">and Rabbi Yehoshua says: </span>He can nullify her vows only in a case where she is waiting <span class="gemarra-regular">for one </span><span class="it-text">yavam</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">but not </span>if she is waiting <span class="gemarra-regular">for two. Rabbi Akiva says: </span>Nullification is not possible at all, <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>if she is waiting <span class="gemarra-regular">for one, and not </span>if she is waiting <span class="gemarra-regular">for two </span>or more.
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer said </span>to his disputants: <span class="gemarra-regular">And just as if </span>one accepts that a man cannot nullify the vows of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman in whom he has no share until she enters into his jurisdiction </span>through betrothal, yet <span class="gemarra-regular">once she enters into his jurisdiction, she is fully </span>under <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>authority for the nullification of her vows, so too with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman </span>in whom <span class="gemarra-regular">he has a share before she enters his jurisdiction, </span>i.e., his <span class="it-text">yevama</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">once she enters his jurisdiction, is it not logical that she be fully </span>under <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>authority for the nullification of her vows?
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva said to him: No, </span>your <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference is refutable. <span class="gemarra-regular">If you spoke of </span>a man having authority over the vows of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman he acquired for himself </span>through betrothal, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>would be different: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as he has no share in her </span>before betrothal, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>too <span class="gemarra-regular">others have no share in her. Will you say </span>the same <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a woman</span> who is <span class="gemarra-regular">acquired for him from Heaven, </span>i.e., his <span class="it-text">yevama</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">for whom, just as he has a share in her, so do others, </span>i.e., his brothers, also <span class="gemarra-regular">have a share in her, </span>as they also are <span class="it-text">yevamin</span>? 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: Akiva, your statement </span>fits a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">with two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yevamin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">what do you answer for </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yavam</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">replied to him: Did we distinguish between one </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yavam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and two </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yevamin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>regardless of <span class="gemarra-regular">whether he performed levirate betrothal or whether he did not perform levirate betrothal? And </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">other matters </span>there is no such distinction, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>too with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">vows. </span>
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> adds a comment: <span class="gemarra-regular">Ben Azzai stated </span>his response to hearing this <span class="gemarra-regular">discussion in this language: Woe [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥaval</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to you, ben Azzai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that you did not serve Rabbi Akiv</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span> properly.
Since this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> was cited in support of Rabbi Ami’s inter-pretation, the Gemara asks: In <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>way 

Daf 75a

<span class="gemarra-regular">is it taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Ami? </span>The Gemara explains that support for Rabbi Ami’s opinion is found in <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, as Rabbi Akiva mentions the following distinction: <span class="gemarra-regular">Whether he performed levirate betrothal or whether he did not perform levirate betrothal. </span>This indicates that Rabbi Eliezer’s statement is referring to a <span class="it-text">yevama</span> with whom he performed levirate betrothal.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>support can be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from the first clause </span>of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">which teaches: Once she enters his jurisdiction, she is fully </span>under <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>authority. <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring to a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where he did not betroth </span>her in levirate betrothal, in <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>sense is <span class="gemarra-regular">she fully </span>under <span class="gemarra-regular">his </span>authority? <span class="gemarra-regular">Deduce from it </span>that the situation is one <span class="gemarra-regular">in which he has performed levirate betrothal.</span>
The Gemara then asks with regard to the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> itself. <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>is the meaning of the phrase: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">other matters </span>there is no such distinction, <span class="gemarra-regular">so </span>too with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">vows, that </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: This is what </span>Rabbi Akiva <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: Do you not conced</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">not liable to </span>be punished with <span class="gemarra-regular">stonin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> for adulterous relations with a <span class="it-text">yevama</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>he would be if she were <span class="gemarra-regular">a betrothed young woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The status of the relationship is inferior to proper marriage, as one who engages in sexual intercourse with a <span class="it-text">yevama</span> does not incur the death penalty. Accordingly, the authority of the <span class="it-text">yavam</span> with regard to vows is also inferior. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: The mishna </span>(74a) <span class="gemarra-regular">is also precisely </span>formulated to indicate this, as it teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">A </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yevama</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not her husband’s full-fledged </span>wife <span class="gemarra-regular">in the same manner that a betrothed woman </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">her husband’s full-fledged </span>wife.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">One who says to his wife: All vows that you will </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from now until I arrive from such and such a place are hereby </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ratified</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">has not said anything, </span>i.e., the vows are not ratified. However, if he states that all vows that she will take until then <span class="gemarra-regular">are hereby nullified, Rabbi Eliezer said: </span>They are <span class="gemarra-regular">nullified, while the Rabbis say: </span>They are <span class="gemarra-regular">not nullified. Rabbi Eliezer said </span>in explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">If one can nullify vows that have reached the status of a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">prohibition</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., that have already taken effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">shall he not </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify vows that have not reached the status of a prohibition?</span>
The Rabbis <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him </span>in response: The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: </span>“Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, <span class="gemarra-regular">her husban</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> may ratify it, or her husband may nullify it” </span>(Numbers 30:14). This teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which has reached the status of </span>eligibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">ratification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a vow that she has already taken, <span class="gemarra-regular">has reached the status of </span>eligibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">nullification. </span>However, a vow that <span class="gemarra-regular">has not reached the status of </span>eligibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">ratification </span>has <span class="gemarra-regular">not reached the status of </span>eligibility for <span class="gemarra-regular">nullification </span>either, and it cannot be nullified.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Rabbi Eliezer, </span>do the vows that the husband nullifies in advance <span class="gemarra-regular">take effect </span>momentarily <span class="gemarra-regular">and are </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">canceled </span>immediately after? <span class="gemarra-regular">Or perhaps they do not take effect at all. </span>The Gemara inquires: <span class="gemarra-regular">In what </span>case is there <span class="gemarra-regular">a difference </span>between these possibilities? 

Daf 75b

The Gemara answers: There is a difference in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where another </span>person <span class="gemarra-regular">associated </span>his own vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with this vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If someone else heard her vow and declared his vow to be like hers, the status of his vow depends on this question. <span class="gemarra-regular">If you say </span>that such vows <span class="gemarra-regular">take effect, </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">the association </span>of the other person’s vow <span class="gemarra-regular">takes effect. If you say </span>that such vows <span class="gemarra-regular">do not take effect </span>at all, then the vow of the other person <span class="gemarra-regular">has no substance, </span>as the vow with which he associated it never existed. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">What, </span>then, is Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer said: If one can nullify vows that have reached the status of a prohibition, shall he not nullify vows that have not reached the status of a prohibition? Learn from it </span>that such vows <span class="gemarra-regular">do not take effect </span>at all, as they are described as not having reached the status of a prohibition.
The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach </span>using the words: <span class="gemarra-regular">That do not reach </span>the status of a prohibition? It <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: That have not reached </span>the status of a prohibition, which could mean that <span class="gemarra-regular">they have not yet reached </span>the status of a prohibition, but they may take effect, momentarily, when she actually takes the vow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> from the <span class="it-text">Tosefta</span> (<span class="it-text">Nedarim</span> 6:5): <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer said to them: And just as in a situation where he cannot nullify his own vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> once he has vowed, he can</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> nullify his own vows before he vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> by stipulating beforehand that the vows he takes should not take effect, all the more so in <span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> situation where he can nullify his wife’s vows </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">after she vows, is it not logical that he should </span>be able to <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify his wife’s vows before she vows?</span>
The Gemara explains the proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not referring to </span>where <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife’s </span>vows are <span class="gemarra-regular">similar to his own </span>in that <span class="gemarra-regular">just as his </span>vows, which were nullified in advance, <span class="gemarra-regular">do not take effect </span>at all, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too </span>the vows of <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife do not take effect </span>at all when nullified in advance? The Gemara rejects this: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, this </span>case of his nullifying his own vows prior to taking them is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is, and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case of his nullifying her vows prior to her taking them is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is; </span>the similarity between the two cases is sufficient for an <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference, but they are not similar in all respects.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to Rabbi Eliezer: </span>Your <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inference is flawed, as can be seen from this example: <span class="gemarra-regular">And just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a ritual bath</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> which elevate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the impure from their </span>ritual <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity </span>when they immerse in it but <span class="gemarra-regular">does not save the pure from becoming impure </span>if they come into contact with impurity after immersion, so too, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a person, who does not elevat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the impure from their impurity, </span>e.g., when a person swallows a ritually impure object and then immerses in a ritual bath, the object remains impure, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not logical that he should not sav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> pure </span>items <span class="gemarra-regular">from becoming impure? </span>When one who has swallowed a ritually pure object comes into contact with impurity, the object he has swallowed should also become impure. This is not the case, as a swallowed object does not become impure when the person who swallowed it does. Therefore the <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> argument is flawed, and one cannot derive from the ability to change a status, like the husband’s ability to nullify his wife’s vows or the ability of the ritual bath to render something ritually pure, that that the source of the change can also prevent a change of status or preserve that status. 
However, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that, according to Rabbi Eliezer, vows nullified by the husband from the outset <span class="gemarra-regular">do not take effect </span>at all, as the Rabbis’ objection presumes that according to Rabbi Eliezer, the vows do not take effect at all. Their argument is based on the analogy between preemptive nullification and preemptive prevention of impurity. Preemptive prevention of impurity is understood to be saving an item from ever becoming impure and analogously, preemptive nullification is understood to be preventing a vow from ever taking effect. 

Daf 76a

The Gemara rejects this conclusion and refers back to the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Say the latter clause </span>of that <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">They said to Rabbi Eliezer: If one immerses an impure vessel to purify </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">shall one immerse a vessel </span>in advance so that <span class="gemarra-regular">when it will become impure it will </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">be purified? Learn from </span>this clause of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that according to Rabbi Eliezer, vows nullified preemptively <span class="gemarra-regular">take effect </span>momentarily and are then immediately nullified. The Rabbis’ objection is that according to Rabbi Eliezer, prior immersion should purify an item that momentarily became impure. 
The Gemara rejects this conclusion: One could <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis could not determin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer, and this is what </span>they <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What do you hold? If you hold that </span>preemptively nullified vows <span class="gemarra-regular">take effect </span>momentarily <span class="gemarra-regular">and are </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">nullified, </span>then the example of <span class="gemarra-regular">a vessel will be your refutation, </span>i.e., will serve to refute your opinion. <span class="gemarra-regular">If you do not hold that they take effect, </span>but rather that they do not take effect at all, then the example of <span class="gemarra-regular">a ritual bath will be your refutation.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear: Rabbi Eliezer said to them: And just as ritually impure seeds</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> once one has sown them in the ground</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> become <span class="gemarra-regular">pure, </span>then with regard to those which <span class="gemarra-regular">are already sow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> and then come into contact with impurity, should they <span class="gemarra-regular">not all the more so </span>be pure? Similarly, vows that have been preemptively nullified should be nullified, since a husband can nullify vows after they have been taken. <span class="gemarra-regular">Learn from </span>this <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that according to Rabbi Eliezer preemptively nullified vows <span class="gemarra-regular">do not take effect </span>at all, just as seeds that were already sown do not become impure at all.
The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis, do they not teach </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span> based upon an <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference of this sort? <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Can a person sell his daughter </span>as a maidservant <span class="gemarra-regular">when she is a young woman? You </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">say an </span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference to show that he cannot: A maidservant who was <span class="gemarra-regular">already sold goes fre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> upon becoming a young woman; with regard to one <span class="gemarra-regular">who has not been sold, is it not logical that she cannot be sol</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> once she already is a young woman? This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> shows that the Rabbis do utilize similar <span class="it-text">a</span> <span class="it-text">fortiori</span> inferences. 

Daf 76b

The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, generally they do teach </span><span class="it-text">halakhot</span> based upon an <span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">fortiori</span> inference of this type, <span class="gemarra-regular">but here it is different, as the verse states: “Her husband may ratify it, or her husband may nullify it” </span>(Numbers 30:14). The Rabbis interpret this to mean: <span class="gemarra-regular">That which has become eligible </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">ratification, </span>i.e., a vow that she has already taken, <span class="gemarra-regular">has become eligible for nullification. </span>However, <span class="gemarra-regular">that which has not become eligible </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">ratification, </span>i.e., a vow she has not yet taken, <span class="gemarra-regular">has not become eligible for nullification.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The <span class="gemarra-regular">nullification of vows </span>can be performed <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">da</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> on the day on which the vow was heard. <span class="gemarra-regular">There is in this matter </span>both <span class="gemarra-regular">a leniency, </span>extending the nullification period, <span class="gemarra-regular">and a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">stricture</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> curtailing that period.
<span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>If a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">took a vow on Shabbat evening</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> her father or husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat evening, and on Shabbat day until dark. </span>This is an example of extending the nullification period. However, if <span class="gemarra-regular">she took a vow with nightfall </span>approaching, her father or husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>the vow only <span class="gemarra-regular">until nightfall, since, if it became dark and he had not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">nullified </span>her vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">he cannot nullify </span>it anymore. This is an example of a curtailed nullification period.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The <span class="gemarra-regular">nullification of vows </span>can be performed <span class="gemarra-regular">all </span><span class="gemarra-regular">da</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> on the day on which the vow was heard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, said: </span>A vow can be nullified <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>a twenty-four-hour <span class="gemarra-regular">period </span>from the time it was heard. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason for the </span>opinion of the <span class="gemarra-regular">first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Gemara answers: Since <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: </span>“But if her husband make them null and void <span class="gemarra-regular">on the day that he hears them” </span>(Numbers 30:13), he derives that the husband can nullify his wife’s vow only until the end of the day on which he hears the vow.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is their reason? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is written: “From day to day” </span>(Numbers 30:15), which indicates that a vow can be nullified from a particular hour on one day until the same hour on the following day.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, isn’t it written: “From day to day”? </span>The Gemara answers: That verse <span class="gemarra-regular">is necessary, as if </span>it had said only <span class="gemarra-regular">“on the day that he hears them,” I would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">during the day, yes, </span>he can nullify vows, but <span class="gemarra-regular">at night </span>he is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>able to. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “From day to day,</span><span class="gemarra-regular">”</span> to teach that nullification can be performed even between one day and the next, i.e., night. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the one who said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">“from day to day” </span>indicates a twenty-four-hour period for nullification, <span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it written: “On the day that he hears them?” </span>The Gemara explains here, too: That verse <span class="gemarra-regular">was necessary, as if </span>it had <span class="gemarra-regular">written </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">“from day to day,” I would say </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for her </span>until the same day in the following week, i.e., he can nullify her vow during the entire period <span class="gemarra-regular">from one Sunday to </span>the next <span class="gemarra-regular">Sunday. </span>Therefore, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is written: “On the day that he hears them” </span>to teach that nullification is limited to a period of a single day of twenty-four hours.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in accordance with that pair [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">zug</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Shimon, who hold that one has an entire twenty-four-hour period to nullify vows. Rather, one can nullify only on that day, as stated in the mishna. The Gemara relates: <span class="gemarra-regular">Levi thought to act in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>two <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. Rav said to him: So said my uncle [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥavivi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> Rabbi Ḥiyya: <span class="gemarra-regular">The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in </span><span class="gemarra-regular">accordance</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with that pair.</span>
The Gemara relates that when a case of dissolving a vow was brought before <span class="gemarra-regular">Ḥiyya bar Rav, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">would shoot an arrow </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">g</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ira</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and examin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> the vow at the same time. In other words, he would not examine the case in great depth, but would immediately dissolve it. Similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba bar Rav Huna would sit </span>to review the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">and stan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> immediately, without conducting a comprehensive examination. 

Daf 77a

§ <span class="gemarra-regular">We learned </span>in a mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">elsewhere </span>(<span class="it-text">Shabbat</span> 157a): A father or husband <span class="gemarra-regular">may nullify </span>his daughter’s or his wife’s <span class="gemarra-regular">vows on Shabba</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and one may request </span>from a halakhic authority <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>dissolve <span class="gemarra-regular">vows that are for the purpos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of Shabbat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: May one <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify vows on Shabbat </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">for the purpose of Shabbat, or </span>may one <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps </span>nullify vows on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">even when they are not for the purpose </span>of Shabbat?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that Rav Zuti from the school of Rav Pappi taught: Vows may be nullified </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">only for the purpose of Shabbat. Rav Ashi said: We did not learn that way </span>in the mishna here. The mishna teaches: If <span class="gemarra-regular">she took a vow with nightfall </span>approaching, her father or husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for her </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">until nightfall. And if you say </span>that with regard to nullification of vows that <span class="gemarra-regular">are</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for the purpose of Shabbat, yes, </span>he may nullify those vows, but nullifications <span class="gemarra-regular">that are not for the purpose of Shabbat, no, </span>he may not, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>does the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">specify nightfall? </span>After all, <span class="gemarra-regular">even during the day he may not nullify that </span>which <span class="gemarra-regular">is not for the purpose </span>of Shabbat.
The Gemara rejects this conclusion: Nullification on Shabbat is subject to a dispute between <span class="gemarra-italic">tanna’im</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: Nullification of vows </span>can be performed <span class="gemarra-regular">all day </span>on the day that the vow was heard. And <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, said: </span>A vow can be nullified <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>a twenty-four-hour <span class="gemarra-regular">period</span> from the time it was heard.
<span class="gemarra-regular">According to the one who says all day, yes, </span>one can nullify vows all day, but <span class="gemarra-regular">not more </span>than that; <span class="gemarra-regular">he may nullify </span>on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>when it is <span class="gemarra-regular">not for the purpose of Shabbat, </span>since otherwise, he could not nullify a vow taken on Shabbat at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">According to the one who says </span>that one can nullify her vows <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>a twenty-four-hour <span class="gemarra-regular">period, </span>that which is <span class="gemarra-regular">for the purpose of Shabbat, yes, </span>he may nullify, but that which is <span class="gemarra-regular">not necessary for Shabbat, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">may not </span>nullify, as he can do so after Shabbat.
§ The mishna from tractate <span class="it-text">Shabbat</span> teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">And one may request </span>from a halakhic authority <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>dissolve <span class="gemarra-regular">vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that are for the purpose of Shabbat. A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: Is this specifically <span class="gemarra-regular">when those </span>who took the vows <span class="gemarra-regular">did not have the opportunity </span>to request dissolution of the vows before Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">or perhaps </span>it is the case even <span class="gemarra-regular">when they did have the opportunity? </span>The Gemara responds: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear: </span>It happened <span class="gemarra-regular">that the Sages attended to </span>the dissolution of the vows of <span class="gemarra-regular">the son of Rav Zutra, son of Rav Zeira, </span>on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">even for vows that they had the opportunity </span>to dissolve <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day, </span>before Shabbat had begun.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef thought to say: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">requesting </span>that a halakhic authority dissolve <span class="gemarra-regular">vows on Shabbat, yes, </span>requesting <span class="gemarra-regular">of a single exper</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> is permitted on Shabbat, but requesting <span class="gemarra-regular">of three laymen </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>permitted on Shabbat, <span class="gemarra-regular">because it looks like </span>a court <span class="gemarra-regular">judgment</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> which may not be performed on Shabbat.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: Since we hold </span>that vows may be dissolved <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>while the halakhic authority <span class="gemarra-regular">is standing,</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">even by relatives, and even at night, </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">does not look like a judgment. </span>Since it is not regarded as an act of a court, vows may be dissolved on Shabbat even by three laymen.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">one can nullify vows at night. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But this is </span>already stated in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna: </span>If a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">took a vow on Shabbat evening, </span>her father or husband can nullify the vow on Shabbat evening; why would Rav Huna need to state his <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, say </span>that Rav’s ruling was as follows: The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">one can request </span>that a halakhic authority dissolve a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">at night.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Abba said to Rav Huna: Did Rav say that? </span>Rav Huna <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>Rav <span class="gemarra-regular">was silent [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ishtik</span><span class="gemarra-regular">] </span>when this ruling was stated in his presence. Rabbi Abba <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Did you say: He was silent [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ishtik</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> indicating that he accepted this ruling, <span class="gemarra-regular">or did you say: </span>He was <span class="gemarra-regular">drinking [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">shatei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">], </span>and was therefore preoccupied, so that his silence did not necessarily indicate agreement? 
In order to clarify Rav’s opinion on the issue, the Gemara cites <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ika bar Avin </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Rav attended to </span>the dissolution of a vow made by <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba, </span>

Daf 77b

<span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a side <span class="gemarra-regular">room [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">kitona</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> of the study hall</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> while <span class="gemarra-regular">standing, alone and at night</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is that <span class="gemarra-regular">one can request </span>the dissolution of <span class="gemarra-regular">vows </span>even when the halakhic authority is <span class="gemarra-regular">standing </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">alone, </span>i.e., without a court of three, as long as he is a halakhic authority, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that one can do so <span class="gemarra-regular">at night, on Shabbat, and by relatives, and even </span>when <span class="gemarra-regular">those </span>requesting dissolution on Shabbat <span class="gemarra-regular">had the opportunity </span>to do so <span class="gemarra-regular">while it was still day, </span>i.e., before Shabbat. 
The Gemara raises a difficulty with this ruling: Can a judge dissolve a vow while <span class="gemarra-regular">standing? But it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel alighted from a donkey, and wrapped himself </span>in his shawl in the customary manner of a judge, <span class="gemarra-regular">and sat, and dissolved </span>a man’s <span class="gemarra-regular">vow for him. </span>If one can dissolve a vow while standing, why did he sit? The Gemara explains: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel holds </span>that one must <span class="gemarra-regular">broach </span>dissolution based <span class="gemarra-regular">on regret</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, a halakhic authority does not dissolve vows directly, but must prompt the one who took the vow to concede that he regrets having taken the vow in the first place. <span class="gemarra-regular">We require that the vow be uprooted, and he needed to examine </span>the case; <span class="gemarra-regular">therefore, he sat down. But Rav Naḥman holds </span>that one need <span class="gemarra-regular">not broach </span>dissolution based <span class="gemarra-regular">on regret, and</span> therefore a halakhic authority can dissolve the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>while <span class="gemarra-regular">standing</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to Rav Naḥman: Master, see that Sage who came from the West, </span>Eretz Yisrael, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: The Sages attended to </span>the dissolution of a vow taken by <span class="gemarra-regular">the son of Rav Huna bar Avin, and they dissolved his vow and said to him: Go and request merc</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for yourself, for you have sinned </span>by taking a vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Dimi, the brother of Rav Safra teaches: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who takes a vow, even if he fulfills it, he is called a sinner</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Zevid said: What verse </span>teaches this? It is: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But if you refrain to vow, it will be no sin in you” </span>(Deuteronomy 23:23). It may be inferred <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you did not refrain </span>from taking vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">there is sin. </span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who says to his wife: Any vows which you will vow, I do not want [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ee</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">efshi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you to vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or one who wants to nullify a vow and says: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is not a vow, has not said anything, </span>as this is not a valid formula of nullification. If he says: <span class="gemarra-regular">You have done well</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">There are none like you, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">If you had not taken a vow, I, myself, would have taken a vow </span>to obligate <span class="gemarra-regular">you </span>in this, <span class="gemarra-regular">his statement is substantial, </span>and the vow is ratified.
<span class="gemarra-regular">A man should not say to his wif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> when nullifying her vows <span class="gemarra-regular">on Shabbat: It is nullified for you, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is canceled for you, in the manner that he would say to her on weekdays. Rather, he should say to her, </span>if she took a vow to refrain from food or drink: <span class="gemarra-regular">Take </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">and eat </span>it,or: <span class="gemarra-regular">Take </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">and drink </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and the vow is canceled on its own. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And he must </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">cancel </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">in his heart</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> simply telling her to eat or drink is not sufficient. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai say: On Shabbat he cancels </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">in his hear</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> and <span class="gemarra-regular">on a weekday he articulates </span>the nullification <span class="gemarra-regular">with his lips. And Beit Hillel say: Both </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, i.e., whether on Shabbat or a weekday, it is sufficient if <span class="gemarra-regular">he cancels </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">in his heart, and he need not articulate with his lips.</span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span><span class="gemarra-regular">A halakhic authority who pronounced </span>his dissolution of a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with language </span>appropriate to <span class="gemarra-regular">a husband</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he said the word nullified instead of dissolved, <span class="gemarra-regular">or a husband who pronounced </span>his nullification of a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with language </span>appropriate to <span class="gemarra-regular">a halakhic authority</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., he said the word dissolved instead of nullified, <span class="gemarra-regular">has not said anything. </span>Each of them has the authority to cancel a vow only in the particular manner allotted to him.
<span class="gemarra-regular">As it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“This is the thing </span>which the Lord has commanded” (Numbers 30:2) indicates that the husband’s nullification, which is the topic of the subsequent verses, must be done specifically in this way. The Sages concluded that <span class="gemarra-regular">a halakhic authority dissolves </span>a vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">but a husband does not dissolve </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought: <span class="gemarra-regular">And just as a halakhic authority</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who cannot nullify </span>vows, nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">dissolves </span>them, so too with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a husband, who can nullify </span>vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not logical that he should </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">dissolve </span>them? Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: </span>

Daf 78a

<span class="gemarra-regular">“This is the thing” </span>(Numbers 30:2), to teach that the husband nullifies vows and <span class="gemarra-regular">a halakhic authority dissolves </span>vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">but a husband does not dissolve </span>them. It <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in <span class="gemarra-regular">another </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“this is the thing” </span>teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">a husband nullifies </span>vows <span class="gemarra-regular">but a halakhic authority does not nullify </span>vows. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, </span>one <span class="gemarra-regular">might </span>have thought: <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as a husband, who cannot dissolve </span>vows, nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">nullifies </span>them, so too with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a halakhic authority, who can dissolve </span>vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not logical that he should </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify </span>them? Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse states: “This is the thing,” </span>to teach us that <span class="gemarra-regular">a husband nullifies </span>vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">but a halakhic authority does not nullify </span>them.
It is taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">It is stated here, </span>with regard to vows: <span class="gemarra-regular">“This is the thing,” and it is stated elsewhere: </span>“Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the thing </span>which the Lord has commanded, saying” (Leviticus 17:2), <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the verse introducing the prohibition against <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtering </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">outside</span> of the Temple courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">Just as with regard to </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered outside </span>the Temple courtyard, the verse is directed to <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron and his sons and all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Israel, so too, the portion </span>in the Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">about vows </span>is directed to <span class="gemarra-regular">Aaron and his sons and all </span>of <span class="gemarra-regular">Israel. And just as here,</span> with regard to vows, the verse states: “And Moses spoke to <span class="gemarra-regular">the heads of the tribes </span>of the children of Israel” (Numbers 30:2), <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, there, </span>with regard to offerings slaughtered outside the Temple courtyard, Moses spoke to <span class="gemarra-regular">the heads of the tribes.</span>
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to the </span>Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">portion on vows, for what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is the verbal analogy between it and slaughtering offerings outside the Temple courtyard taught? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says: </span>The verbal analogy is the source <span class="gemarra-regular">to authorize three layme</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> to dissolve vows. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But isn’t it written:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> “The heads of the tribes”? Rav Ḥisda said, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan: </span>From the phrase “the heads of the tribes” the Sages derive that vows can also be dissolved <span class="gemarra-regular">by a single expert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara then asks the corresponding question about the other passage. The verbal analogy connects <span class="gemarra-regular">“the heads of the tribes” to </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered outside </span>of the Temple courtyard. <span class="gemarra-regular">For what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is this connection made? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: </span>This connection is made in order <span class="gemarra-regular">to say that there is </span>a concept of <span class="gemarra-regular">requesting </span>dissolution of consecration <span class="gemarra-regular">of consecrated </span>property.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Beit Shammai, who say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no </span>possibility of <span class="gemarra-regular">requesting </span>from a halakhic authority to cancel the consecration <span class="gemarra-regular">of consecrated </span>property, the treatment of the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">“the heads of the tribes” as </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">it were written </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered outside </span>the Temple courtyard serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>teach <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">? </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Beit Shammai do not have </span>a tradition of interpreting the verses in accordance with this <span class="gemarra-regular">verbal analogy</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
The Gemara asks: Since Beit Shammai do not use this verbal analogy, <span class="gemarra-regular">for what </span>purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">is “this is the thing,” in the portion on vows, written? </span>The Gemara answers: It is written <span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>that only <span class="gemarra-regular">a halakhic authority dissolves </span>vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">but a husband does not dissolve </span>them; <span class="gemarra-regular">a husband nullifies </span>vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">but a halakhic authority does not nullify </span>them.
According to Beit Shammai, <span class="gemarra-regular">for what </span>purpose <span class="gemarra-regular">is written </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“this is the thing,” </span>found <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the portion on offerings <span class="gemarra-regular">slaughtered outside </span>of the Temple courtyard? The Gemara answers: It is written <span class="gemarra-regular">to say </span>that one <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">liable for slaughtering </span>outside, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>one is <span class="gemarra-regular">not liable for pinchin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span> the neck of a bird-offering outside the Temple courtyard, although that is the way it would be killed if it were a valid offering in the Temple.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But according to Beit Shammai, </span>who do not accept the verbal analogy between vows and the prohibition against slaughtering offerings outside of the Temple courtyard, <span class="gemarra-regular">from where do we </span>derive the source <span class="gemarra-regular">to authorize three laymen </span>to dissolve vows? The Gemara answers: Beit Shammai <span class="gemarra-regular">derive it from </span>the explanation given to <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi bar Natan. </span>
This is <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “And Moses declared the Festivals of the Lord to the children of Israel” </span>(Leviticus 23:44). <span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: The Festivals are stated, but Shabbat, </span>which commemorates <span class="gemarra-regular">Creation, is not stated with them. Ben Azzai says: The Festivals are stated, but the portion on vows is not stated with them.</span>
The Gemara relates that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi bar Natan had a difficulty with this </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. He came to Neharde’a </span>to ask about it <span class="gemarra-regular">before Rav Sheshet, but he did not find him </span>there. <span class="gemarra-regular">He pursued him to Meḥoza </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to </span>him: How can the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> say that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Festivals of the Lord were stated, but Shabbat, </span>which commemorates <span class="gemarra-regular">Creation, was not stated with them?</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">But Shabbat is written with them </span>in the portions of the Torah about the Festivals (Leviticus 23:3; Numbers 28:9–10). <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>can it be said that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Festivals of the Lord are stated, but the portion on vows </span>(Numbers, chapter 30) <span class="gemarra-regular">is not stated with them? Isn’t it next to </span>one of the portions in the Torah detailing the <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> of the Festivals (Numbers, chapters 28–29)? Rav Sheshet <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: This is what </span>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s statement in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: </span>

Daf 78b

<span class="gemarra-regular">The Festivals of the Lord require sanctificatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> by the court</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the Festival dates are established by the court’s determination of the New Moon, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Shabbat, </span>which commemorates <span class="gemarra-regular">Creation, does not requir</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> sanctification by the court. </span>Shabbat is sanctified every week independent of any court decision. 
As for ben Azzai’s statement, it should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Festivals of the Lord require an expert</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the start of the month, which is dependent upon the appearance of the new moon, which in turn determines the Festivals, can be established only by a court composed of experts. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the portion on vows does not require an expert, </span>i.e., vows can be dissolved <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>by <span class="gemarra-regular">a court of laymen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> given to Rav Asi bar Natan also serves to explain Beit Shammai’s source for the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that three laymen can dissolve vows.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">But in the portion on vows </span>the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“the heads of the tribes” </span>(Numbers 30:2) <span class="gemarra-regular">is written. </span>How, then, can it be said that vows can be dissolved by laymen? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said, and some say </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan: </span>From “the heads of the tribes,” the Sages derive that vows can be dissolved <span class="gemarra-regular">by a single exper</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> by himself, but three laymen also have that ability. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥanina says: </span>A husband <span class="gemarra-regular">who is silent </span>and does not formally nullify his wife’s vow <span class="gemarra-regular">in order to annoy [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">lemeikat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> her, but intends to nullify it later, <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">even from no</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> until ten days </span>later. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised an objection </span>to this from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">When did they say </span>that if <span class="gemarra-regular">the husband </span>of a betrothed young woman <span class="gemarra-regular">dies, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">authority </span>to nullify the woman’s vows <span class="gemarra-regular">reverts to the father? </span>The authority reverts to the father <span class="gemarra-regular">when the husband did not hear </span>of her vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">or when he heard and was silent, or when he heard and nullified </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">and died on the same day. But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he heard and ratified </span>it, <span class="gemarra-regular">or if he heard and was silent and died on the following day, he, </span>the father, <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot nullify </span>the vow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">What, is </span>the phrase: Heard and was silent, <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>referring even <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who is silent in order to anno</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> her, and nevertheless nullification is only possible that day, contradicting the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who is silent in order to sustain </span>the vow. The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, this is </span>the same as: <span class="gemarra-regular">Or he heard and ratified, </span>mentioned earlier in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who is silent without any specific </span>intent, as opposed to the husband who is silent in order to annoy his wife, whose intent is to nullify the vow. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda raised an objection </span>from a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In some ways the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is more <span class="gemarra-regular">stringent in ratification than in nullification, and </span>in other ways it is more stringent <span class="gemarra-regular">in nullification than in ratification. </span>The <span class="gemarra-regular">stringency in ratification </span>of vows is

Daf 79a

<span class="gemarra-regular">that silence ratifies </span>a vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">but silence does not cancel, </span>i.e., nullify, a vow. If the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">ratified </span>a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">in his heart</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> it is ratified</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but if <span class="gemarra-regular">he nullified </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">in his heart, it is not nullified</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> adds: <span class="gemarra-regular">If he ratified </span>a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">he can no longer nullify </span>it; and similarly, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he nullified </span>a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">he can no longer ratify </span>it. In any case, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that silence ratifies </span>a vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>referring even <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who is silent in order to annoy </span>his wife?
The Gemara rejects this interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span>it is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who is silent in order to sustain </span>the vow. The Gemara asks: If so, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is </span>the same as: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">ratified </span>a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">in his heart, it is ratified. Rather, </span>the phrase in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: Silence ratifies a vow, is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>a case where the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">is silent without specifying </span>his intent.
Relating to the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">We found </span>how the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is more <span class="gemarra-regular">stringent in ratification </span>of vows <span class="gemarra-regular">than in nullification </span>of vows, but <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">we </span>find a case <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>which the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is more stringent <span class="gemarra-regular">in nullification than in ratification? Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One can request </span>from a halakhic authority dissolution of <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">ratificatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of a vow his wife took, <span class="gemarra-regular">but one cannot request </span>dissolution of <span class="gemarra-regular">the nullificatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of a vow.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Kahana raised an objection </span>to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina that a husband who is silent about his wife’s vow in order to annoy her can nullify it even several days later. A <span class="it-text">baraita</span> teaches: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her </span>from day to day, then he causes all her vows to be ratified” (Numbers 30:15). <span class="gemarra-regular">The verse is speaking of one who is silent in order to annoy </span>his wife. Do <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the verse is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who is silent in order to annoy </span>her, <span class="gemarra-regular">or it is </span>referring <span class="gemarra-regular">only to one who is silent in order to ratify </span>the vow?
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">When it says, </span>in the continuation of the same verse: “He has ratified them, <span class="gemarra-regular">because he held his peace at her </span>on the day that he heard them” (Numbers 30:15), <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse is speaking of one who is silent in order to ratify </span>the vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">How do I realize </span>the meaning of: <span class="gemarra-regular">“If her husband altogether holds his peace at her”? </span>It must be that <span class="gemarra-regular">the verse is speaking of one who is silent in order to anno</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> his wife, and that this is also considered an act of ratification. This <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">teyuveta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of Rabbi Ḥanina’s opinion.
The Gemara asks about this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">And let </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">interpret this </span>part of the verse as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who is silent in order to ratify</span> the vow, and <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>part of the same verse as referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to one who was silent without specifying </span>his intent, as the Gemara suggests above in explanation of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Superfluous verses are writte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> about silence, leading to the conclusion that whatever the reason for the husband’s silence, the vow is ratified.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised </span>a further <span class="gemarra-regular">objectio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina, from a mishna (76b): If <span class="gemarra-regular">she took a vow </span>on Friday <span class="gemarra-regular">with nightfall </span>approaching, her father or husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>the vow only <span class="gemarra-regular">until nightfall, since, if it became dark and he had not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">nullified </span>her vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">he cannot nullify </span>it anymore. <span class="gemarra-regular">Why </span>should this be so? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>the fact that the husband refrained from nullifying the vow out of respect for Shabbat be regarded <span class="gemarra-regular">like one who is silent in order to annoy </span>his wife, who, according to Rav Huna, can still nullify the vow later. The fact that this is not the case is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation </span>of the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection </span>to Rabbi Ḥanina’s opinion, from another mishna (87b): If a husband or father said, after failing to nullify a vow on the day he heard it: <span class="gemarra-regular">I know that there are vows, but I do not know that there are those who </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">nullif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> vows, i.e., he was unaware that he can nullify a vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">he can nullify </span>it even after the day he heard it. However, if he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I know there are those who nullify, but </span>I refrained from nullifying the vow because <span class="gemarra-regular">I do not know that this is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a vo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> that I could nullify, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says: He cannot nullify </span>at this point, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the Rabbis say: </span>Even in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">he can nullify </span>the vow when he discovers his error.
Rav Ashi asks rhetorically: <span class="gemarra-regular">But why </span>may he not nullify according to Rabbi Meir’s opinion? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let </span>his silence by mistake be <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who is silen</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in order to annoy, </span>who, according to Rabbi Ḥanina, can nullify the vow at a later stage. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutation </span>of Rabbi Ḥanina’s opinion.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">And these are </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">that he,</span> the husband or father, <span class="gemarra-regular">can </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nullify</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> The first category consists of <span class="gemarra-regular">matters that involve affliction </span>for the woman who took the vow. For example, if a woman vowed: <span class="gemarra-regular">If I bathe, or: If I do not bathe; </span>if she vowed: <span class="gemarra-regular">If I adorn myself [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">etkashet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">or: If I do not adorn myself. </span>

Daf 79b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said: These are not vows of affliction. Rather, these are vows of affliction: </span>For example, if <span class="gemarra-regular">she said: The produce of the </span>entire <span class="gemarra-regular">world is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me as if </span>it were <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he can nullify </span>the vow, as it certainly involves affliction. If, however, she said: <span class="gemarra-regular">The produce of this countr</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span><span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me,</span> he cannot nullify the vow, as it does not involve affliction, since <span class="gemarra-regular">he may </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">bring her </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">from another country. </span>Similarly, if she said: <span class="gemarra-regular">The produce of this storekeeper is </span><span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me, he cannot nullify </span>her vow, as he may still bring her produce from another storekeeper. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>he can obtain <span class="gemarra-regular">his sustenance only from him, </span>that particular storekeeper, <span class="gemarra-regular">he can nullify </span>the vow. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yosei.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara raises a question with regard to the ruling of the mishna: Is it only <span class="gemarra-regular">vows of affliction that he can nullify, </span>whereas vows <span class="gemarra-regular">that do not involve affliction he cannot nullify? But isn’t it taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse “These are the statutes that the Lord commanded Moses, <span class="gemarra-regular">between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter” </span>(Numbers 30:17) <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that a husband can nullify </span>any of his wife’s <span class="gemarra-regular">vows that </span>adversely affect the relationship <span class="gemarra-regular">between him and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> even if they do not involve affliction? 
The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: In fact, <span class="gemarra-regular">he can nullify</span> both <span class="gemarra-regular">these and those</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> There is, <span class="gemarra-regular">however, </span>a difference between them. When he nullifies vows of <span class="gemarra-regular">affliction, he nullifies </span>them <span class="gemarra-regular">forever, </span>i.e., the vows remain nullified even if they subsequently divorce. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>when he nullifies vows that <span class="gemarra-regular">do not involve affliction </span>but merely impact upon their relationship, then, <span class="gemarra-regular">while </span>they are married and <span class="gemarra-regular">she is under his </span>authority <span class="gemarra-regular">it is an </span>effective <span class="gemarra-regular">nullification, </span>but <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">divorces her, her vow takes effect upon her, </span>i.e., his nullification is no longer effective. As stated, this is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>vows concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">matters that </span>adversely affect the relationship <span class="gemarra-regular">between him and her, that do not involve affliction. However, </span>if he nullifies a vow that affects their relationship and also <span class="gemarra-regular">involves affliction, her vow does not take effect upon her </span>even after she leaves her husband’s authority. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>as for vows concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">matters that do not involve affliction, when </span>a man <span class="gemarra-regular">divorces </span>his wife, do <span class="gemarra-regular">they </span>really <span class="gemarra-regular">take effect upon her? But didn’t we learn </span>in a mishna with regard to a woman who prohibited her handiwork to her husband by way of a vow (85a) that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says: </span>Even though the vow is presently invalid, as a woman cannot render forbidden to her husband that to which he is already entitled, <span class="gemarra-regular">he should </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify </span>the vow? This is because <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he will </span>one day <span class="gemarra-regular">divorce her, </span>at which point the vow will take effect <span class="gemarra-regular">and she will </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">be forbidden to him, </span>since he will be unable to remarry her lest he come to benefit from her handiwork. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">if he divorces her </span>after <span class="gemarra-regular">having nullified her </span>vow <span class="gemarra-regular">from the outset, </span>before their divorce, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>a permanent <span class="gemarra-regular">nullification, </span>and although the vow does not involve affliction it remains nullified after their divorce. 
Consequently, the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say</span> a different answer: With regard to both <span class="gemarra-regular">these and those, </span>vows of affliction and vows adversely affecting the relationship between them, when the husband nullifies the vow, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>a permanent <span class="gemarra-regular">nullification. Rather, </span>the difference between them is as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Vows of affliction he can </span>fully <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify, both with respect to himself and with respect to others, </span>i.e., the vow remains nullified even if he divorces her and she marries another man. Whereas vows that <span class="gemarra-regular">do not involve affliction </span>but still adversely affect the relationship between him and her <span class="gemarra-regular">he can </span>permanently <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify with respect to himself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but <span class="gemarra-regular">he cannot nullify with respect to others; </span>if she marries another man, the vow takes effect. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>according to this explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">this is what </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: These are </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">vows that he can nullify both for himself and for others: Vows that involve affliction. </span>
§ The mishna teaches that, according to the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, a woman’s vow: <span class="gemarra-regular">If I bathe, </span>falls into the category of vows of affliction, whereas Rabbi Yosei disagrees and says that this is not a vow of affliction. The Gemara asks: As the phrase: If I bathe, is not the main substance of the vow, but rather the woman wishes to prohibit herself from deriving a certain benefit depending on whether or not she bathes, with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">what </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">speaking? If we say that she said: The produce of the world is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me if I bathe, why, </span>according to the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">does she </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">nullification </span>at all to prevent her affliction? Let her <span class="gemarra-regular">not bathe and this produce of the world will not be forbidden to her. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>this explanation is problematic for a different reason: <span class="gemarra-regular">With regard to </span>a vow of <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>type, <span class="gemarra-regular">would Rabbi Yosei sa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">these are not vows of affliction? </span>There is certainly room for concern that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps she will bathe and the produce of the world will be forbidden to her, </span>a situation that certainly entails deprivation. 

Daf 80a

<span class="gemarra-regular">But rather, </span>explain <span class="gemarra-regular">that she said: The benefit of bathing is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for m</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forever if I bathe. </span>And it is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to that </span>reason that <span class="gemarra-regular">he may nullify her </span>vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">as what can she do </span>if there is no nullification? If <span class="gemarra-regular">she bathes, the benefit of bathing is </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden to her. </span>And if <span class="gemarra-regular">she does not bathe, she will </span>suffer temporary <span class="gemarra-regular">disfigurement [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">nivvula</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And Rabbi Yosei, </span>who maintains that this is not a vow of affliction, <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is possible for her not to bathe, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">we are not concerned about </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">disfigurement. </span>
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, let </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teach like this</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yosei says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">this condition does not involve affliction, </span>as the content of the vow itself is irrelevant, since she can fulfill the condition.
The Gemara offers another explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>explain <span class="gemarra-regular">that she said: The benefit of bathing is </span><span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me forever if I bathe today</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And Rabbi Yosei maintains </span>that nothing will happen if she refrains from bathing today, as the <span class="gemarra-regular">disfigurement </span>resulting <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>not bathing for <span class="gemarra-regular">one da</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not called disfigurement. </span>

Daf 80b

The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">You </span>have adequately <span class="gemarra-regular">answered </span>the expression: <span class="gemarra-regular">If I bathe, </span>but as for the vow: <span class="gemarra-regular">If I do not bathe, what are the circumstances? If we say that she said: The benefit of bathing shall be forbidden to me forever if I do not bathe today, why does she </span>need <span class="gemarra-regular">nullification </span>at all? <span class="gemarra-regular">Let her bathe </span>today and nothing will be forbidden. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said: </span>The mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where she said: The benefit of bathing is </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me forever if I do not bathe in </span>foul <span class="gemarra-regular">water </span>in which flax was <span class="gemarra-regular">soaked</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The husband can nullify this vow, as it will make her repulsive, which is a form of disfigurement. 
The Gemara raises an objection: In that case, you must <span class="gemarra-regular">similarly </span>explain <span class="gemarra-regular">that which</span> the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: If I do not adorn myself, </span>to mean: The benefit of adorning myself is forbidden to me forever if I do not do something repulsive, e.g., <span class="gemarra-regular">if I do not adorn myself with naphtha [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">neft</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> But this cannot be, as such a substance <span class="gemarra-regular">is filthy </span>and the term adornment cannot be applied to it at all. 
Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where she said: The benefit of bathing </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me forever if I bathe today</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and </span>I take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will not bath</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> today. Through a combination of her vow and her oath she has rendered it prohibited for her to bathe forever. The situation is similar if she said: <span class="gemarra-regular">The benefit of adornment </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me forever if I adorn myself today, and </span>I take <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath that I will not adorn myself </span>today. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said to Rav Ashi: </span>According to this explanation, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span><span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">should have taught: These are the vows and oaths </span>that he can nullify. Rav Ashi <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Teach </span>so in the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">These are the vows and oaths. And if you wish, say </span>instead that <span class="gemarra-regular">oaths are also </span>included in the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">vows. As we learned </span>in a mishna (9a): If one said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Like the vows of the wicked, </span>he has <span class="gemarra-regular">vowed with respect to </span>becoming <span class="gemarra-regular">a nazirite, and with regard to </span>bringing <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering, and with regard to </span>taking <span class="gemarra-regular">an oath. </span>This shows that an oath can also be called a vow.
§ The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>do <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, </span>i.e., the first <span class="it-text">tanna</span>, mean to <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">bathing </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when she does not bathe it involves affliction? </span>The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that states: <span class="gemarra-regular">Although one is prohibited from </span>performing <span class="gemarra-regular">any </span>of the five activities associated with affliction on Yom Kippur, i.e., eating or drinking, bathing, anointing, engaging in sexual intercourse, and wearing leather shoes, <span class="gemarra-regular">one is punished </span>with <span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> only when one eat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or drinks or performs </span>prohibited <span class="gemarra-regular">labor alone</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">does not bathe there is affliction, </span>and for this reason a husband may nullify such a vow taken by his wife, then <span class="gemarra-regular">if one bathes on Yom Kippur,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he should be liable </span>to receive <span class="gemarra-italic">karet</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>in accordance with the verse “For whatever person shall not be afflicted on that same day, he shall be cut off [<span class="it-text">venikhreta</span>] from his people” (Leviticus 23:29), as he has failed to observe this form of affliction. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>The meaning of the affliction in each case may be learned <span class="gemarra-regular">from the context of the verse. With regard to Yom Kippur, where it is written: </span>“On the tenth of the month <span class="gemarra-regular">you shall afflict your souls” </span>(Leviticus 16:29), the reference is to <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter for which one knows </span>and feels <span class="gemarra-regular">the affliction </span>right <span class="gemarra-regular">now, </span>on Yom Kippur itself, i.e., abstention from food and drink, which is felt within a short period of time. One who abstains from <span class="gemarra-regular">bathing, </span>however, <span class="gemarra-regular">does not know </span>and feel <span class="gemarra-regular">the affliction now, </span>but only later. By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to vows, where it is written: “Every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul, </span>her husband may uphold it, or her husband may nullify it” (Numbers 30:14), the reference is to <span class="gemarra-regular">a matter that leads to affliction</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and if she does not bathe </span>for an extended period of time, <span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>eventually <span class="gemarra-regular">leads to affliction.</span>
§ The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>between this statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yosei and </span>another statement <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rabbi Yosei. </span>It was taught in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a spring belonging to the residents of a city, </span>if the water was needed for <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">lives, </span>i.e., the city’s residents required the spring for drinking water, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it was also needed for <span class="gemarra-regular">the lives of others, their </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">lives take precedence over the lives of others. </span>Likewise, if the water was needed for <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">animals and </span>also for <span class="gemarra-regular">the animals of others, their </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">animals take precedence over the animals of others. </span>And if the water was needed for <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">laundry and </span>also for <span class="gemarra-regular">the laundry of others, their </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">laundry takes precedence over the laundry of others. </span>However, if the spring water was needed for <span class="gemarra-regular">the lives of others and their </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">laundry, the lives of others take precedence over their </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">laundry.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: </span>Even <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">laundry takes precedence over the lives of others</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as the wearing of unlaundered clothes can eventually cause suffering and pose a danger. The Gemara clarifies the difficulty presented by this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Now, </span>if with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">laundry, Rabbi Yosei said </span>that refraining from laundering one’s clothes <span class="gemarra-regular">involves pain </span>and affliction, 

Daf 81a

is it <span class="gemarra-regular">not all the more so </span>the case that if one does not bathe, which affects the <span class="gemarra-regular">entire body, </span>Rabbi Yosei would agree that he will suffer pain? The Gemara refutes this argument: The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Yes, </span>the pain of refraining from <span class="gemarra-regular">laundering </span>one’s clothes <span class="gemarra-regular">is stronger, according to Rabbi Yosei, </span>than the pain of not washing one’s body. <span class="gemarra-regular">As </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: Grim</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> on </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">hea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> leads to blindness, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">grime on </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">clothes leads to madness, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">grime on </span>one’s <span class="gemarra-regular">body leads to boils and sores, </span>which are less serious than madness and blindness. Based on this it may be suggested that according to Rabbi Yosei, soiled clothing presents a greater danger than an unwashed body. 
§ With regard to this issue, the Gemara relates that the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">sent </span>the following message <span class="gemarra-regular">from there, </span>i.e., Eretz Yisrael, to Babylonia: <span class="gemarra-regular">Be careful with regard to grime,</span> as it can lead to disease and sickness. <span class="gemarra-regular">Be careful </span>to learn Torah <span class="gemarra-regular">in the compan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> of others, rather than study it alone. And <span class="gemarra-regular">be careful </span>with regard to the education <span class="gemarra-regular">of the sons of paupers,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> as </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">from them </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah will issue forth. As it is stated: “Water shall flow from his branches [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">midalyav</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Numbers 24:7), which is expounded to mean: From the poor ones [<span class="it-text">midalim</span>] among him, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">from them </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Torah, </span>which may be compared to water, <span class="gemarra-regular">will issue forth. </span>
With regard to a similar matter, the Gemara inquires: <span class="gemarra-regular">And for what reason is it not common for Torah scholars to give rise to Torah scholars from among their sons? </span>Why are Torah scholars generally born to paupers, who are not Torah scholars themselves? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">so that they should not say the Torah is their inheritance</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, it is unusual to find that all the sons of a Torah scholar are also Torah scholars. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">so that they should not be presumptuous </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">yitgadderu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> toward the community, </span>with the knowledge that they will be Torah scholars like their fathers. <span class="gemarra-regular">Mar Zutra said: Because they </span>take advantage of their fathers’ standing to <span class="gemarra-regular">lord over the community </span>and are punished for their conduct. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi said: Because they call </span>ordinary <span class="gemarra-regular">people donkeys.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina says: </span>They are punished <span class="gemarra-regular">because they do not first recite a blessing over the Tora</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span> before commencing their studies. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: What is </span>the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “Who is the wise man that may understand this, </span>and who is he to whom the mouth of the Lord has spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land is perished and laid waste like a wilderness, so that none passes through” (Jeremiah 9:11)? <span class="gemarra-regular">This matter, </span>the question as to why Eretz Yisrael was destroyed, <span class="gemarra-regular">was asked of the Sages, </span>i.e., “the wise man,” <span class="gemarra-regular">and of the prophets, </span>“he to whom the mouth of the Lord has spoken,” <span class="gemarra-regular">but they could not explain it. </span>
The matter remained a mystery <span class="gemarra-regular">until the Holy One, Blessed be He, Himself explained </span>why Eretz Yisrael was laid waste, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written </span>in the next verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And the Lord said: Because they have forsaken My Torah </span>which I set before them, and have not obeyed My voice, nor walked therein” (Jeremiah 9:12). It would appear that <span class="gemarra-regular">“have not obeyed My voice” is </span>the same as <span class="gemarra-regular">“nor walked therein.”</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: </span>The expression “nor walked therein” means <span class="gemarra-regular">that they do not first recite a blessing over the Torah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and they are therefore liable to receive the severe punishments listed in the verse.
§ Returning to the issue of laundering clothes, the Gemara relates that it once happened that <span class="gemarra-regular">Isi bar Yehud</span><span class="gemarra-regular">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> did not come to the academy of Rabbi Yosei </span>for <span class="gemarra-regular">three </span>straight <span class="gemarra-regular">days. Vardimus</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> son of Rabbi Yosei, found him </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: What is the reason that the Master did not come to Father’s academy these three days? He said to him: When I do not know your father’s reasoning, how can I come? </span>Vardimus <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: Let the Master say what he, </span>my father, <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying to him; perhaps I know his reasoning. He said to him: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">laundry takes precedence over the lives of others, from where do we </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">a verse </span>that teaches this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? 
Vardimus <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: As it is written </span>with regard to the Levite cities: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And their open land shall be for their animals </span>and for their substance, and for all their beasts” (Numbers 35:3). <span class="gemarra-regular">What is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">“their beasts”? If we say </span>an actual <span class="gemarra-regular">beast, </span>there is a difficulty, <span class="gemarra-regular">as isn’t a beast included in </span>the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">animal, </span>which has already been mentioned in the verse? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, what is </span>the meaning of <span class="gemarra-regular">“their beasts </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">ḥayyatam</span>]”? It means <span class="gemarra-regular">their actual lives [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥiyyuta</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. </span>This, however, is difficult, as it <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious </span>that the Levites received their cities in order to live their lives there. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">laundering </span>clothes, <span class="gemarra-regular">as there is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">pain </span>caused by the <span class="gemarra-regular">grime </span>on one’s unwashed clothes? Since it is vitally necessary for their well-being, laundering the clothing of the city’s residents takes precedence over the lives of others.
§ With regard to the vows: If I bathe, and: If I do not bathe, and: If I adorn myself, and: If I do not adorn myself, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said </span>in the mishna that <span class="gemarra-regular">these are not vows of affliction. A dilemma was raised </span>before the Sages: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to Rabbi Yosei, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> as to whether the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>these vows <span class="gemarra-regular">as matters that </span>adversely affect the relationship <span class="gemarra-regular">between him and her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>a resolution to this question from what <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei said: These are not vows of affliction, </span>which indicates, <span class="gemarra-regular">however, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are matters </span>that affect the relationship <span class="gemarra-regular">between him and her. </span>
The Gemara refutes this proof: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>Rabbi Yosei <span class="gemarra-regular">was speaking to </span>the Rabbis in accordance with <span class="gemarra-regular">their </span>own opinion, as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to my </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">they are not even matters </span>that affect the relationship <span class="gemarra-regular">between him and her. </span>But <span class="gemarra-regular">according to your </span>opinion, <span class="gemarra-regular">that you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they are vows of affliction, agree with me </span>at least that <span class="gemarra-regular">these are not vows of affliction. </span>In other words, one should not infer from the phrasing of Rabbi Yosei’s response to the Rabbis that he holds that these vows are concerning matters that affect the relationship between him and her, as he was merely countering the claim of the Rabbis that they are vows of affliction.
The question therefore remains: <span class="gemarra-regular">What </span>does Rabbi Yosei maintain in this regard? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Adda bar Ahava says: He can nullify </span>these vows as matters between him and her, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Huna says: He cannot nullify </span>them. 

Daf 81b

And it cannot be argued that if the woman refrains from bathing or adorning herself, it will negatively impact on her relationship with her husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">as we do not find a fox dying in the earth of the lai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> to which it is accustomed. Similarly, a husband who is accustomed to his wife will not come to avoid engaging in sexual intercourse with her merely because she has not bathed. 
The Gemara comments that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Adda bar Ahava: </span>Vows taken by a woman concerning <span class="gemarra-regular">matters</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> that involve affliction </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify, whether </span>they relate to matters <span class="gemarra-regular">between him and her or </span>to matters <span class="gemarra-regular">between her and others. </span>As for vows concerning matters <span class="gemarra-regular">that do not involve affliction, </span>if they relate to matters <span class="gemarra-regular">between him and her, he can nullify </span>them, but if they relate to matters <span class="gemarra-regular">between her and others, he cannot nullify </span>them. <span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">she said: Produce is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me, he can nullify </span>the vow, as it falls into the category of vows of affliction. If, however, she said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not prepare </span>anything <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father, as that is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me or: <span class="gemarra-regular">For your brother, </span>or: <span class="gemarra-regular">For your father</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> or: <span class="gemarra-regular">For my brother, or: I will not place straw before your animal, or: </span>I will not place <span class="gemarra-regular">water before your cattle, he cannot nullify </span>such vows, as they do not touch upon the relationship between husband and wife, nor do they cause her affliction. 
A wife said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not pain</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> my eyes, as <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me; <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not roug</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">efkos</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> my cheeks, as <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me; <span class="gemarra-regular">or: I will not engage in sexual intercourse, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me. If she made any of these statements, her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>them, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>they are <span class="gemarra-regular">matters that </span>adversely affect the relationship <span class="gemarra-regular">between him and her.</span>
A wife said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not make your bed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me; <span class="gemarra-regular">or: I will not prepare your cup for you, </span>mixing your wine with water, as <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me; <span class="gemarra-regular">or: I will not wash your face, your hands, or your feet, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me. If she made these statements, her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">need not nullify </span>these vows. They do not take effect, since she is obligated to perform these tasks as part of her marital duties. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel says: He should </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify </span>such vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “He shall not profane his word” </span>(Numbers 30:3), which teaches that it is improper for one to take a vow and not fulfill it. The Gemara presents another interpretation of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He shall not profane his word,” from here </span>it may be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that a halakhic authority cannot dissolve his own vows</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
After having cited the entire <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, the Gemara proceeds to analyze the relevant component: Of <span class="gemarra-regular">whom </span>have <span class="gemarra-regular">we heard that he said </span>that if a woman says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not paint </span>my eyes, as <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, <span class="gemarra-regular">or: I will not rouge </span>my cheeks, the vows fall into the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">matters that </span>adversely affect the relationship <span class="gemarra-regular">between him and her? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>as the Rabbis, who disagree with him, maintain that they are vows of affliction, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>such vows <span class="gemarra-regular">as matters that </span>adversely affect the relationship <span class="gemarra-regular">between him and her. </span>Therefore, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> supports Rav Adda bar Ahava’s understanding of the opinion of Rabbi Yosei. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">The Master said </span>in the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that if the woman said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not engage in sexual intercourse, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify</span> the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>an example of <span class="gemarra-regular">matters that </span>adversely affects the relationship <span class="gemarra-regular">between him and her. </span>The Gemara raises a question: <span class="gemarra-regular">What are the circumstances </span>of the case? <span class="gemarra-regular">If we say that she said: The benefit of my </span>engaging in <span class="gemarra-regular">intercourse </span>with you <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to you, why do I </span>need the husband’s <span class="gemarra-regular">nullification </span>at all? <span class="gemarra-regular">She is obligated to </span>engage in intercourse with <span class="gemarra-regular">him </span>by the very nature of their marriage, and it is not within her power to release herself from this duty by means of a vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> must refer to a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">she said: The benefit of your </span>engaging in <span class="gemarra-regular">intercourse </span>with me <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me, and </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rav Kahana. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Kahana said </span>that if a woman says: <span class="gemarra-regular">The benefit of my </span>engaging in <span class="gemarra-regular">intercourse </span>with you <span class="gemarra-regular">is</span> forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he can compel her to have relations with him. </span>If, however, she said: <span class="gemarra-regular">The benefit of your </span>engaging in <span class="gemarra-regular">intercourse </span>with me <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he must nullify </span>her vow. Why must the husband nullify it if she is obligated to have relations with him? It is <span class="gemarra-regular">because we do not feed a person something that is forbidden to him. </span>Although she cannot release herself from her duty, since she prohibited herself from deriving pleasure from the act, she may not engage in sexual intercourse, as it would entail forbidden pleasure. 
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Who </span>is the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> who <span class="gemarra-regular">taught that which is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">matters that are permitted</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but others were accustomed to </span>treat <span class="gemarra-regular">them </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">a prohibition,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> you are not allowed to treat them as permitted in a manner </span>that may <span class="gemarra-regular">cause the negation of </span>their custom, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is stated: “He shall not profane his word” </span>(Numbers 30:3). The verse indicates that any vow in which a person renders a matter forbidden to himself, i.e., “his word,” is considered a quasi-vow, which may not be profaned. The Gemara presents another interpretation of the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“He shall not profane his word”; from here </span>it may be derived <span class="gemarra-regular">that a halakhic authority cannot dissolve his own vows. Whose </span>opinion is this? <span class="gemarra-regular">It is </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabban Gamliel, </span>who maintains that a man should nullify his wife’s vow even if it does not actually take effect. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised a dilemma before Rav Naḥman: </span>If a woman took a vow that <span class="gemarra-regular">sexual intercourse </span>with her husband is forbidden to her, then, <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the Rabbis, is it </span>a vow of <span class="gemarra-regular">affliction or </span>does it fall within the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">matters that </span>adversely affect the relationship <span class="gemarra-regular">between him and her? </span>Rav Naḥman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: You learned </span>the answer to this question in a mishna (90b): <span class="gemarra-regular">And</span> if a woman said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am removed from the Jews, </span>i.e., the benefit of my engaging in intercourse is forbidden to all Jews, 

Daf 82a

her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">must nullify his part, </span>i.e., the part of the vow that affects him, so that she will be permitted to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and she may engage in intercourse with him, but she is removed from </span>all other <span class="gemarra-regular">Jews, </span>so that if he divorces her, she is forbidden to everyone. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say that </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">is a vow of affliction, why should she be removed from </span>all other <span class="gemarra-regular">Jews? </span>Wasn’t it already established that when a husband nullifies a vow of affliction for his wife, he nullifies it not only with respect to himself but with respect to others as well? Rather, <span class="gemarra-regular">learn from here </span>that such vows <span class="gemarra-regular">are </span>under the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">matters that </span>adversely affect the relationship <span class="gemarra-regular">between him and her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore he can nullify it only with respect to himself. 
The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">According to the Rabbis, you </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">have the dilemma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> because </span>the mishna dealing with a woman who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am removed from the Jews, was taught by Rabbi Yosei. As Rav Huna said: Our entire chapte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei. From where </span>do we know this? <span class="gemarra-regular">Since </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches: Rabbi Yosei says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">these are not vows of affliction, why does it need to teach further, </span>at the end of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">He can nullify </span>the vow; this is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yosei? Learn from this </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">from this </span>point <span class="gemarra-regular">forward, </span>the rest of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei. </span>Accordingly, this mishna teaches us only the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, not that of the Rabbis. 
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said in the name of Levi: A husband can nullify all vows </span>of affliction <span class="gemarra-regular">for his wife, except for </span>the vow: <span class="gemarra-regular">Benefit </span>from <span class="gemarra-regular">me </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for so-and-so, which he cannot nullify, </span>as it is entirely between her and another person. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if she says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Benefit </span>derived <span class="gemarra-regular">from so-and-so </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me, he can nullify </span>the vow, as it considered a vow of affliction, since she might one day need that person and be unable to avail herself of his services due to her vow. 
The Gemara raises an objection from that which <span class="gemarra-regular">we learned </span>in the mishna: If she said: <span class="gemarra-regular">The produce of this country </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> he cannot nullify the vow, as it does not involve affliction, since <span class="gemarra-regular">he can </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">bring her </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">from another country. </span>This vow is similar to a vow by which she prohibits herself from deriving benefit from another person. Why, then, does Shmuel say that the husband cannot nullify it? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>The mishna is referring to a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">who said </span>in her vow: <span class="gemarra-regular">That you bring</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> In other words, she did not prohibit herself from deriving benefit from the produce of that country entirely, but only from the produce that her husband himself would bring her. She may still enjoy that produce if it is brought to her by someone else or if she brings it for herself. 
The Gemara raises another objection from the next clause of the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear: </span>If the woman took a vow saying: <span class="gemarra-regular">The produce of this storekeeper is </span><span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me, </span>her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot nullify </span>the vow. But didn’t Shmuel say that if a woman prohibits herself from benefiting from a certain person, her husband can nullify the vow? The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here too, </span>the mishna is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where she said </span>in her vow: The produce <span class="gemarra-regular">that you bring </span>from this storekeeper is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me. 
The Gemara questions this resolution: But the continuation of the mishna states: But <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>the husband can obtain <span class="gemarra-regular">his sustenance only from him, </span>i.e., that particular storekeeper, <span class="gemarra-regular">he can nullify </span>his wife’s vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that this is referring to a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where </span>the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>in her vow: The fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">that you bring </span>from this storekeeper is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, <span class="gemarra-regular">why can </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify </span>her vow? Other people can bring her the fruit on his behalf. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, from </span>the fact that <span class="gemarra-regular">the latter clause </span>of the mishna must be dealing with a case where the woman renders all fruit forbidden to herself, even that which <span class="gemarra-regular">the husband does not bring her, the first clause </span>must also refer to a case where the woman renders forbidden even the fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">that she </span>herself <span class="gemarra-regular">brings, </span>and nevertheless the husband cannot nullify the vow. Therefore, the objection raised against Shmuel remains. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>the Gemara retracts its previous answer and explains the matter as follows: In the <span class="gemarra-regular">first clause </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot nullify </span>his wife’s vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the case is one where she renders forbidden even the fruit <span class="gemarra-regular">that she </span>herself <span class="gemarra-regular">brings. </span>

Daf 82b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And the mishna is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, </span>who is more restrictive in his definition of affliction. <span class="gemarra-regular">As Rav Huna said</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Our entire chapter is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei. </span>Shmuel, on the other hand, rules in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. <span class="gemarra-regular">And what </span>does Rabbi Yosei mean when he says that the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot nullif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> his wife’s vows? He means that he cannot nullify them <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>vows of <span class="gemarra-regular">affliction, but he can nullify </span>them as <span class="gemarra-regular">vows that </span>adversely affect the relationship <span class="gemarra-regular">between him and her. </span>
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: </span>In a case where a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">vowed </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">two loaves </span>are forbidden to her, and if she abstains <span class="gemarra-regular">from one </span>of them she would <span class="gemarra-regular">deprive herself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as it is a fine-quality loaf, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>if she abstains <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>she would <span class="gemarra-regular">not deprive herself, </span>as it is a poor-quality loaf, then, <span class="gemarra-regular">since </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the </span>loaf that would cause her to <span class="gemarra-regular">deprive herself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> like any other vow of affliction, <span class="gemarra-regular">he can </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the </span>loaf that would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>cause her to <span class="gemarra-regular">deprive herself. And Rav Asi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: </span>The husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the </span>loaf that would cause her to <span class="gemarra-regular">deprive herself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but he cannot nullify </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the </span>loaf that would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>cause her to <span class="gemarra-regular">deprive herself.</span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">And some say </span>a different version of this dispute, according to which <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Asi raised a dilemma before Rabbi Yoḥanan: </span>In a case where a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">vowed </span>not to eat <span class="gemarra-regular">from two loaves </span>of bread, and if she abstains <span class="gemarra-regular">from one </span>of them she would <span class="gemarra-regular">deprive herself, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>if she abstains <span class="gemarra-regular">from </span>the other <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>she would <span class="gemarra-regular">not</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> deprive herself, what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Rabbi Yoḥanan <span class="gemarra-regular">said to him: </span>The husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the </span>loaf that would cause her to <span class="gemarra-regular">deprive herself, but he cannot nullify </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the </span>loaf that would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>cause her to <span class="gemarra-regular">deprive herself</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> 
Rav Asi <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an objection </span>against Rabbi Yoḥanan from the following mishna (<span class="it-text">Nazir</span> 23a): With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman who vowed</span> to be <span class="gemarra-regular">a nazirite</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and she </span>transgressed her vow and <span class="gemarra-regular">drank wine or became impure </span>by coming into contact <span class="gemarra-regular">with the dead, </span>

Daf 83a

<span class="gemarra-regular">she incurs [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">sofeget</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> the forty </span>lashes, the penalty for one who transgresses a Torah prohibition, as she violated the terms of her nazirite vow. If <span class="gemarra-regular">her husband nullified </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but she did not know that he nullified it for her, and she drank wine or became impure through </span>contact with <span class="gemarra-regular">the dead, she does not incur the forty </span>lashes. She did not commit a transgression, as her nazirite vow was nullified.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the </span>loaf that would cause her to <span class="gemarra-regular">deprive herself, but he cannot nullify </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the </span>loaf that would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>cause her to <span class="gemarra-regular">deprive herself, </span>the same reasoning should apply to a nazirite vow: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">nullified for her </span>the vow that rendered <span class="gemarra-regular">wine </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>her, <span class="gemarra-regular">as she suffers pain </span>when she refrains from drinking it. But as for her vow that rendered grape <span class="gemarra-regular">seeds and </span>grape <span class="gemarra-regular">skins </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>her, <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not nullify </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for her, as she suffers no pain </span>when she abstains from them. And since even grape seeds and grape skins are forbidden to a nazirite, if the woman ate of them, <span class="gemarra-regular">she should receive the forty </span>lashes, even if her husband nullified her vow. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef </span><span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>Here it is different, as <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship cannot take effect partially</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Since one cannot be a nazirite and accept only some of the prohibitions of naziriteship, the husband’s nullification cancels the entire vow. In the case of an ordinary vow, on the other hand, the husband can nullify only the part that causes his wife suffering. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: </span>The wording of your statement suggests that naziriteship cannot take effect partially, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering is </span>brought <span class="gemarra-regular">for partial </span>observance of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rather, Abaye said </span>that one should say as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Naziriteship cannot take effect partially, and no offering is </span>brought <span class="gemarra-regular">for partial </span>observance of naziriteship.
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>from the following statement: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman who vowed to be a nazirit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and she designated her anima</span><span class="gemarra-regular">l</span> for her nazirite offering, <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward her husband nullified </span>her vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for her, she must bring a bird sin-offering but she does not bring a bird burnt-offering. And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">no offering is </span>brought <span class="gemarra-regular">for partial </span>observance of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship, why must she bring a bird sin-offering? </span>
The Gemara rejects this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">But rather, what </span>will you say? That <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering is </span>brought <span class="gemarra-regular">for partial </span>observance of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship? </span>If so, she <span class="gemarra-regular">should be required to bring three animal</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> as offerings, <span class="gemarra-regular">a sin-offering, a burnt-offering, and a peace-offering, </span>in accordance with the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> governing a nazirite who has completed the period of his vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>say as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, no offering is </span>brought <span class="gemarra-regular">for partial </span>observance of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship, and </span>as for <span class="gemarra-regular">the bird sin-offering that she must bring, </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>a bird <span class="gemarra-regular">sin-offering </span>can be brought <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>a case of <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> She must therefore bring a sin-offering for the partial naziriteship that she observed.
Rav Asi <span class="gemarra-regular">raised an</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> objection </span>against the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman who vowed to be a nazirite and she became ritually impur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> through contact with the dead, <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward her husband nullified </span>her vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for her, she must bring a bird sin-offering but does not bring a bird burnt-offering. And if you say </span>that the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the </span>loaf that would cause her to <span class="gemarra-regular">deprive herself, but he cannot nullify </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the loaf that would <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>cause her to <span class="gemarra-regular">deprive herself, </span>the same reasoning should apply here: 

Daf 83b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps</span> the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">nullified for her </span>the vow that rendered <span class="gemarra-regular">wine </span>forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>her, <span class="gemarra-regular">as she suffers pain </span>when she refrains from drinking it. But as for her vow that <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity </span>imparted <span class="gemarra-regular">by the dead </span>is forbidden to her, <span class="gemarra-regular">he did not nullify </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for her, as she suffers no pain </span>by not becoming impure through contact with the dead. Why, then, does she not bring the offerings that must be brought by a nazirite who became ritually impure through contact with the dead? This implies that since the husband can nullify a vow with regard to a matter that would cause her to deprive herself, he can also nullify a vow with regard to a matter that would not cause her to deprive herself. 
The Gemara rejects this argument: The Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">say </span>in response that a woman who vows that <span class="gemarra-regular">impurity </span>imparted <span class="gemarra-regular">by the dead </span>is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">also suffers pai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> as a result. How so? <span class="gemarra-regular">As it is written: “And the living shall lay it to his heart” </span>(Ecclesiastes 7:2), <span class="gemarra-regular">and it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir would say: What </span>is the meaning of that <span class="gemarra-regular">which is written: “And the living shall lay it to his heart”? </span>This means that one <span class="gemarra-regular">who eulogizes </span>others when they die <span class="gemarra-regular">will </span>in turn <span class="gemarra-regular">be eulogized </span>when he himself dies; one <span class="gemarra-regular">who weeps </span>for others <span class="gemarra-regular">will be wept for </span>when he himself passes away; and one <span class="gemarra-regular">who buries </span>others <span class="gemarra-regular">will </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">be buried </span>upon his passing. A woman who cannot participate in the funerals of others because she is barred from contracting impurity through contact with a corpse is distressed by the thought that she will receive similar treatment when she dies. Therefore, her vow involves affliction and can be nullified by her husband. The conclusion is that this case does not present a difficulty for Rabbi Yoḥanan.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a woman vowed: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>other <span class="gemarra-regular">people is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will </span>not <span class="gemarra-regular">benefi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> from it, her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nullif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> her vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>nevertheless, if she is poor, <span class="gemarra-regular">she may benefit from </span>the agricultural gifts that must be left for the poor: <span class="gemarra-regular">Gleanings, </span>i.e., isolated stalks that fell during the harvest; <span class="gemarra-regular">forgotten </span>sheaves; <span class="gemarra-regular">and produce of the corners [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span> of the field that the owner is obligated to leave for the poor. Enjoyment of these gifts is not considered as benefit derived from people, as these gifts are not given voluntarily out of the kindness of the donors, but in the performance of a mitzva. 
If one said: I will not let <span class="gemarra-regular">priests </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">Levites benefit from me, </span>as that is <span class="gemarra-italic">kona</span><span class="gemarra-italic">m</span> for me, <span class="gemarra-regular">they can take </span>the priestly and Levitical gifts from him <span class="gemarra-regular">against his will. </span>If, however, he said: I will not let <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>specific <span class="gemarra-regular">priests and these </span>specific <span class="gemarra-regular">Levites benefit from me, </span>as that is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, they are <span class="gemarra-regular">taken by others.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if a woman vowed not to derive benefit from people, her husband cannot nullify her vow. The Gemara infers from this <span class="it-text">halakha</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>this is because the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">can be sustained from his, </span>i.e., her husband’s, property, without having to take from others. This proves <span class="gemarra-regular">by inference that </span>in this context <span class="gemarra-regular">a husband is not included in</span> her reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">people, </span>as, although she mentioned people in her vow, she did not mean to prohibit herself from deriving benefit from her husband. The Gemara asks: But <span class="gemarra-regular">say the latter clause </span>of that same part of the mishna, which states: But <span class="gemarra-regular">she may </span><span class="gemarra-regular">benefi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">from gleanings, forgotten </span>sheaves, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>This implies that she may derive benefit from the gifts given to the poor, <span class="gemarra-regular">but she may not eat </span>from property belonging <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">husband. Apparently, a husband is </span>in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">included in </span>her reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">people, </span>and she may not benefit from him either. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ulla said: Actually, </span>a husband <span class="gemarra-regular">is not included in </span>her reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">people, </span>and there is no contradiction. Rather, the mishna provides two reasons why he cannot nullify his wife’s vow. The first reason, which is merely implied by the mishna, is that she can be sustained by her husband. <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore </span>there is the stated reason, that <span class="gemarra-regular">he cannot nullify </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">because she may benefit from gleanings, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">forgotten </span>sheaves, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>the opposite: <span class="gemarra-regular">Actually, a husband is included in </span>her reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">people, </span>and therefore his wife may not benefit from him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>when the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">states </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, it employs the style known as: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and it should be understood as follows: <span class="gemarra-regular">What is the reason </span>that the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot nullify </span>his wife’s vow? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because she may benefit from gleanings, forgotten </span>sheaves, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman said: Actually, </span>a husband <span class="gemarra-regular">is not included in </span>her reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">people</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and her vow not to derive benefit from all people does not include him, which is why he cannot nullify it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And this is what </span>the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">is teaching: </span>The husband cannot nullify his wife’s vow, because even if <span class="gemarra-regular">she becomes divorced </span>and can no longer derive benefit from her husband, as he is now included in her reference to people, <span class="gemarra-regular">she may </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from gleanings,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> forgotten </span>sheaves, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>

Daf 84a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava raised an objection to </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman: And is a husband not included in </span>her reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">people</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> But didn’t we learn </span>otherwise in a mishna (90b): If a woman said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am removed from the Jews, </span>i.e., the benefit of intercourse with me is prohibited to all Jews, her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">must nullify his part, </span>i.e., the part that affects him. She would be permitted to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and she may engage in intercourse with him, but she is removed from </span>all other <span class="gemarra-regular">Jews, </span>so that if he divorces her, she is forbidden to all.
The Gemara explains the difficulty: If you say that the husband is included in this vow, it follows that he can nullify his part, as it is a vow that adversely affects the relationship between him and her, but the vow is not permanently nullified; if they divorce she is removed from all Jews, including him. <span class="gemarra-regular">But if you say a husband is not included in </span>her reference to <span class="gemarra-regular">people, </span>then it is not a vow that touches upon their personal relationship, but rather <span class="gemarra-regular">it is a vow of affliction</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he can nullify </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for her forever. </span>
Rav Naḥman responded: <span class="gemarra-regular">I </span>could <span class="gemarra-regular">say to you </span>that in general a husband is not included in her reference to people, but <span class="gemarra-regular">here it is different, as it is clea</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> that the woman means to include her husband in the vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">as she </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">to render forbidden to herself </span>a matter <span class="gemarra-regular">that is </span>otherwise <span class="gemarra-regular">permitted </span>to her and not to render forbidden to herself intercourse with men other than her husband, which is in any case forbidden to her. Therefore, she certainly intended to render herself forbidden to her husband. 
§ The mishna teaches that if a woman took a vow prohibiting herself from benefiting from people, <span class="gemarra-regular">she may </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from gleanings, forgotten </span>sheaves, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span><span class="gemarra-italic">pe’</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. </span>The Gemara notes that the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">does not teach </span>that she may benefit from these gifts <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">from poor man’s tithe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span><span class="gemarra-regular">isn’t it taught in a </span><span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> that she may benefit from these gifts <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">from poor man’s tithe? </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yosef said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult, </span>as the matter is the subject of a tannaitic dispute. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span><span class="it-text">baraita</span> that says that the woman may derive benefit even from poor man’s tithe reflects the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer, </span>whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>mishna, which does not mention poor man’s tithe, reflects the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the Rabbis, as we learned </span>in a mishna (<span class="it-text">Demai</span> 4:3): <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer says: A person need not </span>actually set aside, nor even <span class="gemarra-regular">designate by name, the poor man’s tithe of doubtfully tithed produce [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">demai</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., produce purchased from an <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’</span><span class="it-text">aretz</span>, one who is not diligent in separating tithes, as poor man’s tithe has no sanctity, and a poor man cannot claim it from him, since he cannot offer proof that this produce in fact has the status of poor man’s tithe. 

Daf 84b

<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say: He must designate </span>poor man’s tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">by name</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular">but he need not </span>actually <span class="gemarra-regular">set </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">asid</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> and give it to anyone, as a poor person cannot claim the tithe without bringing proof that he has a right to it. Rav Yosef now suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">according to the one, </span>i.e., the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>as to whether or not poor man’s tithe had been separated by the <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden as untithed produce </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">tevel</span>], and therefore the owner of the produce must designate the poor man’s tithe by name, he <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the owner of the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">has the benefit of discretion, </span>meaning that he may give the poor man’s tithe to the poor person of his choice. <span class="gemarra-regular">And since he has the benefit of discretion, </span>the option that a woman who vowed not to benefit from people should take poor man’s tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">is ineffective, </span>as she would be receiving benefit from the owner of the tithe, since he could have given it to someone else. 
Rav Yosef continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And according to the one, </span>i.e., Rabbi Eliezer, <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he need not designate </span>poor man’s tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">by name, </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>as to whether or not poor man’s tithe had been separated by the <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">does not render </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden as untithed produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And whenever </span>the case is <span class="gemarra-regular">that uncertainty does not render </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden as untithed produce, </span>the owner <span class="gemarra-regular">does not have the benefit of discretion </span>and does not choose to which poor person he will give it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>therefore one who vowed not to benefit from people <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to </span>derive <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit </span>from poor man’s tithe, as he is not receiving it from anyone. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: </span>This proof is not conclusive, as it may be <span class="gemarra-regular">that everyone </span>agrees that the <span class="gemarra-regular">uncertainty </span>as to whether or not poor man’s tithe had been separated by the <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">renders </span>the produce <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden as </span>untithed produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disagree with regard to this </span>issue: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Eliezer maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-italic">amei</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">ha’aretz</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are not suspected of </span>failing to set aside <span class="gemarra-regular">poor man’s tithe. </span>Therefore, one who purchases <span class="it-text">demai</span> from an <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span> need not be concerned that its poor man’s tithe might not have been set aside. Rabbi Eliezer maintains this opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">because were </span>the <span class="it-text">am</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span> to <span class="gemarra-regular">declare </span>all <span class="gemarra-regular">his property ownerless and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">become a poor man, and </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">take </span>the poor man’s tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">himself, he </span>would suffer <span class="gemarra-regular">no loss </span>when he set aside this tithe, and therefore it is assumed that he separated it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis maintain </span>that while it is theoretically possible for one to avoid having to actually part from his poor man’s tithe, this is uncommon, as <span class="gemarra-regular">a person does not </span>ordinarily <span class="gemarra-regular">declare his property ownerless </span>for this purpose, <span class="gemarra-regular">as he is afraid </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps someone else will acquire it </span>in the meantime. <span class="gemarra-regular">Consequently, </span>one who sets aside poor man’s tithe from his produce is assumed to incur a loss, and therefore <span class="it-text">amei</span> <span class="it-text">ha’aretz</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">are suspected </span>with regard to this tithe. Accordingly, no satisfactory explanation has yet been given as to why the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> permits a woman who vowed not to derive benefit from people to take poor man’s tithe.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava says </span>that it is possible to explain the apparent contradiction between the sources with regard to benefit from poor man’s tithe without recourse to a tannaitic dispute: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>the mishna is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to poor man’s tithe distributed in the </span>owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., poor man’s tithe that had not been distributed in the threshing floor but was brought home and must now be distributed to the poor who visit the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>the term <span class="gemarra-regular">giving is written </span>in the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>such a tithe: <span class="gemarra-regular">“And you shall give to the Levite, to the stranger, </span>to the orphan, and to the widow” (Deuteronomy 26:12), and the owner is entitled to give the tithe to the poor man of his choice, as the benefit of discretion is conferred upon him. <span class="gemarra-regular">Due to that </span>reason, it <span class="gemarra-regular">is prohibited </span>for one who vowed not to derive benefit from people <span class="gemarra-regular">to derive benefit </span>from this type of poor man’s tithe. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>however, the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is referring <span class="gemarra-regular">to poor man’s tithe that is distributed in the threshing floor. Since with regard to </span>such a tithe <span class="gemarra-regular">it is written: “And you shall leave it at your gates” </span>(Deuteronomy 14:28), the owner cannot designate it for a particular person, and any poor person who comes by may take it from him. As the owner lacks the benefit of discretion, one who vows not to benefit from people <span class="gemarra-regular">is permitted to benefit </span>from this poor man’s tithe.
§ The mishna teaches that if one said: I will not let <span class="gemarra-regular">priests and Levites benefit from me, they can take </span>the priestly and Levitical gifts from him against his will. The Gemara notes: <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit of discretio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> to give his <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes to the priest or Levite of his choice <span class="gemarra-regular">is not </span>considered to have <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary </span>value. The priests and Levites can take the gifts from the owner of the produce against his will, and the latter is not regarded as having conferred benefit upon them. 
But <span class="gemarra-regular">say the latter clause </span>of the mishna, which states that if the person said: I will not let <span class="gemarra-regular">these </span>specific <span class="gemarra-regular">priests and these </span>specific <span class="gemarra-regular">Levites benefit from me, </span>these gifts are <span class="gemarra-regular">taken by others. But these </span>priests and Levites specified in his vow may <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>take these gifts. <span class="gemarra-regular">Apparently, </span>this ruling indicates that the <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit of discretion is </span>considered to have <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary value, </span>and therefore the owner can prohibit specific priests or Levites from deriving benefit from him. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hoshaya said: </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">not difficult; this </span>second ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi, <span class="gemarra-regular">and that </span>first ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">one steals another’s untithed produce and eats it, he must pay him the value of his untithed produce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., the full value of what he stole. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, </span>disagrees and <span class="gemarra-regular">says: He pays </span>him <span class="gemarra-regular">only the value of the non-sacred </span>produce <span class="gemarra-regular">it contained. </span>The thief does not have to pay him the value of the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithe included in the untithed produce, as these portions do not belong to the owner of the produce. <span class="gemarra-regular">What, is it not </span>the case that <span class="gemarra-regular">they disagree about this: </span>

Daf 85a

<span class="gemarra-regular">That Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi <span class="gemarra-regular">holds </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit of discretion is </span>considered to have <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary value, </span>and therefore a thief must pay the full value of the untithed produce. The owner has monetary rights in the priestly and Levitical gifts, by virtue of the fact that he may give his <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes to the priest and Levite of his choice. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds </span>that the <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit of discretion is not </span>considered to have <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary value, </span>meaning that the owner of the produce has no monetary rights whatsoever in the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes included in the untithed produce. 
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <span class="gemarra-regular">No, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">as everyone </span>agrees that the <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit of discretion is not </span>considered to have <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary </span>value. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, here they</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> disagree with regard to </span>whether priestly and Levitical <span class="gemarra-regular">gifts that have not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">been separate</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> are considered as if they have already been separated, meaning the dispute is whether the untithed produce is categorized as a mixture of regular produce and tithes, or as a non-sacred category in and of itself. If they are not seen as having already been separated, the thief must restore everything he took. But if they are regarded as having already been separated, then the thief returns only the non-sacred portion of the produce, as the priestly and Levitical gifts did not belong to the owner. 
The Gemara counters this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">But if </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit of discretion is not </span>considered to have <span class="gemarra-regular">monetary value, what is </span>the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">to me </span>if the gifts <span class="gemarra-regular">have </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">been separated, </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the difference <span class="gemarra-regular">to me if they have not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">been separated</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Either way, the owner of the produce has no monetary rights in the portions of <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes contained in the untithed produce. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, </span>one must explain that <span class="gemarra-regular">this is the reasoning of Rabbi </span>Yehuda HaNasi: <span class="gemarra-regular">The Sages penalized the thief so that he would not steal </span>again by requiring him to repay the full value of what he stole, despite the fact that the owner of the untithed produce has no monetary rights in the <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes included in it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the Sages penalized the owne</span><span class="gemarra-regular">r</span> of the produce, awarding him only the value of the non-sacred portion of the produce, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that </span>in the future <span class="gemarra-regular">he would not delay </span>with <span class="gemarra-regular">his untithed produce, </span>but rather separate its <span class="it-text">teruma</span> and tithes as soon as the produce is harvested. Had he set aside and distributed the gifts promptly they would not have been stolen. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>that there is another way to reconcile the apparent contradiction in the mishna: As stated, the second case, where the person prohibits specific priests and Levites from benefiting from him, indicates that the benefit of discretion is considered to have monetary value. However, <span class="gemarra-italic">terum</span><span class="gemarra-italic">a</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is different, as this is the reason that </span>priests <span class="gemarra-regular">can take </span><span class="it-text">teruma</span> from him <span class="gemarra-regular">against his will </span>in a case where one prohibited all priests from deriving benefit from him: <span class="gemarra-regular">Because </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is fit only for priests, and since he came to render it prohibited to them, he made it, </span>for him, <span class="gemarra-regular">like mere dust</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> If this <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, which certainly cannot be eaten by Israelites, is now forbidden to priests as well, the owner has effectively removed it from his own possession. Therefore, the priests do not derive any benefit from him if they take it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a woman said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not produce </span>anything <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> as <span class="gemarra-regular">that is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, <span class="gemarra-regular">or: For your father, or: For my brother, or: For your brother, </span>her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot nullify </span>such vows, as they do not fall under the category of vows that adversely affect the relationship between him and her. By contrast, if she said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not produce </span>anything <span class="gemarra-regular">for you, </span>including the work that she is obligated to do for him according to the terms of her marriage contract, as <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">need not nullify </span>the vow at all. It is automatically void, since she is obligated to perform those tasks. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva says: He should </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify </span>the vow, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps she will excee</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> the required amount of work and do <span class="gemarra-regular">more for him than is fitting for him </span>to receive. If she does more than the fixed amount of work that a woman is obligated to perform for her husband, the vow will be valid with respect to the excess to which he is not entitled, and he might inadvertently come to benefit from something that is forbidden to him. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nur</span><span class="gemarra-regular">i</span> also <span class="gemarra-regular">says </span>that he <span class="gemarra-regular">should nullify </span>the vow, but for a different reason: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps he will </span>one day <span class="gemarra-regular">divorce her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> at which point the vow will take effect <span class="gemarra-regular">and she will </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">be forbidden to him </span>forever, i.e., he will be unable to remarry her, lest he come to benefit from her labor. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Shmuel said: The </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri. </span>The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this to say that Shmuel maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person can consecrate an entity that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come into the world? </span>According to Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, her vow is valid with respect to things she will do after her divorce, even though at present she is not divorced and she has not yet produced anything. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from a mishna (<span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> 58b): If <span class="gemarra-regular">one consecrates his wife’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">earnings</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> 

Daf 85b

<span class="gemarra-regular">she may work and sustain </span>herself from her earnings, as the consecration is ineffective. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">the surplus </span>earnings, i.e., if she produced more than she needs for her sustenance, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says </span>the surplus becomes <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>property, whereas <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar says </span>that it is <span class="gemarra-regular">non-sacred. And Shmuel said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar. Apparently, </span>Shmuel’s opinion is that <span class="gemarra-regular">a person cannot consecrate an entity that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come into the world</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and therefore a man cannot consecrate earnings that his wife will produce only in the future. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">when </span>Shmuel <span class="gemarra-regular">is saying </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri he was saying </span>only that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is such <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the surplus, </span>there is a difficulty. One might say that since Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri disagrees with Rabbi Akiva, he apparently maintains that a woman’s surplus earnings belong to her husband, and therefore she cannot render them forbidden to him through a vow, and it is only with respect to this point that Shmuel said that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri. If this is the case, there is no contradiction between his ruling here and his ruling in <span class="it-text">Ketubot</span> that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> with regard to one who consecrates his wife’s earnings is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar. 
But if so, <span class="gemarra-regular">let </span>Shmuel clearly <span class="gemarra-regular">say: </span>The <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">surplus. Alternatively, </span>he could have said that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">the first </span><span class="gemarra-italic">tanna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>who also maintains that the surplus belongs to the husband. <span class="gemarra-regular">Alternatively, </span>he could have said that the <span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is not in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>who asserts that the surplus belongs to the wife. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Yosef said </span>that the apparent contradiction between Shmuel’s rulings can be resolved in the following manner: Although one cannot consecrate an entity that has not yet come into the world, <span class="gemarra-italic">konamot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are different; since a person can prohibit to himself another’s produce </span>by means of a <span class="it-text">konam</span>, even though one cannot consecrate another’s produce to the Temple, <span class="gemarra-regular">he can also prohibit to himself an entity that has not yet come into the world. </span>With regard to consecration, however, a person cannot dedicate to the Temple treasury something that is not currently in his possession, and he cannot consecrate an entity that has not yet entered the world, either. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Abaye said to him: </span>This is no proof at all. <span class="gemarra-regular">Granted, a person can prohibit another’s produce to himself, since a person can prohibit his </span>own <span class="gemarra-regular">produce to another. But </span>does it follow that <span class="gemarra-regular">he can </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">prohibit an entity that has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">come into the world to another person, </span>seeing <span class="gemarra-regular">that a person cannot prohibit another’s produce to </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">other </span>person, as he has jurisdiction neither over the produce nor over the person to whom he wishes to prohibit it? Yet in the mishna here the woman prohibits her future earnings, which do not yet exist, to another person, i.e., her husband.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: </span>Here the mishna is dealing <span class="gemarra-regular">with </span>a woman who <span class="gemarra-regular">says: My hands are consecrated to the One Who made them</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Therefore, the case does not involve the issue of an entity that has not yet come into the world, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">hands are </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">in the world.</span>
The Gemara challenges this interpretation: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if she said </span>her vow <span class="gemarra-regular">like this, are they consecrated </span>and forbidden? <span class="gemarra-regular">But aren’t her hands pledged to her husband, </span>to do the work she is obligated to perform for him? The Gemara answers: The mishna is referring to a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">who said: </span>The vow will take effect <span class="gemarra-regular">when I become divorced. </span>The Gemara raises a difficulty: <span class="gemarra-regular">She is not divorced now in any event, and from where </span>is it learned <span class="gemarra-regular">that when she says </span>her vow <span class="gemarra-regular">like this, </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">is effective? </span>How is it learned that she can consecrate something in such a manner that it will become consecrated only in the future? 

Daf 86a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ila said: And what </span>is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>one person <span class="gemarra-regular">says to another </span>before selling him a field: <span class="gemarra-regular">This field that I am sellin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to you </span>now, <span class="gemarra-regular">when I will buy it </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">from you, let it be consecrated? Is </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">not consecrated </span>when it is repurchased? In similar fashion, a woman can consecrate her future handiwork, even though the sanctity cannot presently take effect. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yirmeya objects to this </span>comparison: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are </span>the two cases <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable? </span>When a person says: Let <span class="gemarra-regular">this field that I am selling to you </span>now be consecrated when I buy it back from you, <span class="gemarra-regular">now </span>at least the field <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">in his possession, </span>and he can therefore consecrate it now, stipulating that the consecration should take effect only when it returns to his ownership. As for the <span class="gemarra-regular">woman, </span>however, is it currently <span class="gemarra-regular">in her power to consecrate her handiwork? </span>At present it does not belong to her. <span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is comparable only to </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who said to another: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this field that I sold to yo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">u</span> in the past, <span class="gemarra-regular">when I will buy it </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">from you, let it be consecrated. </span>In such a case, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">consecrated </span>when it is repurchased? 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa objects to this </span>comparison: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are </span>the cases <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable? In </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">the sale </span>of a field, <span class="gemarra-regular">the matter is clear-cut, </span>i.e., it is evident that the field belongs absolutely to its new owner, the buyer. In contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">in </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman, is the matter clear-cut? </span>Even though the husband has rights to his wife’s handiwork, he does not own her body. Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case of a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">is comparable only to </span>that of one person <span class="gemarra-regular">who said to another: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this field that I pledged to you, when I will redeem it </span>back <span class="gemarra-regular">from you, let it be consecrated. </span>Here, the owner retains possession of the field itself, but another person enjoys the right to its fruit. In this case, <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the field <span class="gemarra-regular">not consecrated </span>when it is redeemed? Here too, a woman retains ownership of her body and she can consecrate her handiwork, stipulating that the consecration should take effect only after she is divorced. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, objects to this </span>comparison: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are </span>the cases <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable? </span>In the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a field, it is in </span>the owner’s <span class="gemarra-regular">power to redeem it </span>immediately by repaying his debt. But as for <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman, </span>is it <span class="gemarra-regular">in her power to be divorce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> whenever she chooses? Therefore, <span class="gemarra-regular">this </span>case <span class="gemarra-regular">is comparable only to </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">one who said to another: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">this field that I pledged to yo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">u</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for ten years</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> when I will redeem it from you, let it be consecrated. </span>In such a case, even though the owner cannot redeem the field for ten years, <span class="gemarra-regular">is it not consecrated </span>once it is redeemed?
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi objects to this </span>comparison: <span class="gemarra-regular">Are </span>the cases <span class="gemarra-regular">comparable? There, </span>in the case of a field, there is a <span class="gemarra-regular">fixe</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> time frame of ten years. But in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a woman, is there a fixed </span>time limit, so that she can know in advance when she will be divorced and released from her husband’s jurisdiction? 

Daf 86b

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Ashi said </span>that this is the reason Shmuel ruled in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri: Although a person cannot consecrate an entity that has not yet come into the world, <span class="gemarra-italic">konamot</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> are different</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> They are stringent and take effect in all cases, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span>their prohibited status <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>considered <span class="gemarra-regular">akin to inherent sanctity</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> When one person prohibits another from deriving benefit from a particular item by means of a <span class="it-text">konam</span>, the forbidden item is treated as if it has inherent sanctity. It cannot be redeemed and can never become permitted. Because of its severity, a woman can forbid her handiwork to her husband by means of a <span class="it-text">konam</span>, even though she is obligated to hand over the fruits of her labor to him. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>this is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion <span class="gemarra-regular">of Rava. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">As Rava said: Consecratio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of an item to the Temple, becoming subject to the prohibition of <span class="gemarra-regular">leavened bread </span>on Passover, <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span> the <span class="gemarra-regular">emancipatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of a slave <span class="gemarra-regular">abrogate </span>any <span class="gemarra-regular">lien </span>that exists upon them. The lien on that property does not prevent the consecration, the prohibition of leavened bread, or the emancipation of the slave from taking effect. In all three cases, the debtor loses his ownership of the liened property. The same <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies to a <span class="it-text">konam</span>, whose prohibition has the severity of inherent sanctity. Even though the husband has a right to his wife’s handiwork, which could be described as a lien on her hands, that lien is abrogated when she renders her handiwork forbidden to him by means of a <span class="it-text">konam</span>, and therefore the vow must be nullified.  
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">If so, why do I</span> need Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri’s stated reason: <span class="gemarra-regular">Perhaps he will </span>one day <span class="gemarra-regular">divorce her? </span>If the woman’s <span class="it-text">konam</span> abrogates the husband’s lien, the prohibition should take effect immediately. The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Teach </span>that the vow takes effect right away, which is why the husband must nullify it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And furthermore, </span>adds Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, even if you maintain that the Sages strengthened a husband’s lien so that the vow does not take effect immediately, there is another reason to nullify the vow, as <span class="gemarra-regular">perhaps he will </span>one day <span class="gemarra-regular">divorce her</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a man’s <span class="gemarra-regular">wife took a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">w</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and he thought that </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">his daughter </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">had taken a vow, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">his daughter took a vow and he thought that </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">had taken a vow, </span>or if his wife <span class="gemarra-regular">vowed to </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">a nazirite and he thought that she had </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vowed to </span>bring <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">she vowed to </span>bring <span class="gemarra-regular">an offering and he thought that she had vowed to </span>be <span class="gemarra-regular">a nazirite, </span>or if <span class="gemarra-regular">she took a vow </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">figs </span>are forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">and he thought that she had taken a vow </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">grapes </span>are forbidden to her, or if <span class="gemarra-regular">she took a vow </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">grapes </span>are forbidden to her <span class="gemarra-regular">and he thought that she had taken a vow </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">figs </span>are forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to </span>her, and he nullified any of these vows, in each case, when he realizes his error with regard to the vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>must <span class="gemarra-regular">repeat </span>the action <span class="gemarra-regular">and nullify </span>the vow a second time.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s ruling that if a man’s wife took a vow, but he thought that it was his daughter who had taken the vow and he nullified the vow, he must nullify the vow a second time, the Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is this to say that </span>the phrase “But if her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">disallowed her [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">otah</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Numbers 30:9) <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">precise</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> In other words, does the use of the word her, <span class="it-text">otah</span>, indicate that a man can nullify a vow only for the specific woman who took it? 

Daf 87a

The Gemara comments: <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>is it not so that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">tears </span>in one’s clothing that are made for the dead, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written “for,” “for,” </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">about which is written: </span>“And David took hold of his garments and rent them, and likewise all the men that were with him, and they wailed, and wept, and fasted until the evening, <span class="gemarra-regular">for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, </span>and for the people of the Lord, and for the house of Israel, because they were fallen by the sword” (II Samuel 1:11–12). The use of the word “for” with regard to each of them indicates that one must make a separate tear in his garment for each person who died.
The Gemara asks: <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>yet it <span class="gemarra-regular">is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">they said to him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">his father had died and he ren</span><span class="gemarra-regular">t</span> his garment over his death, <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward it was discovered </span>that it was not his father who died, but <span class="gemarra-regular">his son, he has fulfilled </span>his obligation of <span class="gemarra-regular">rending </span>his garment. This shows that even if a person mistakenly tore his garment for the wrong person he has nevertheless fulfilled the obligation. Here too, if a man nullified the vow of his wife, thinking that it was the vow of his daughter, his nullification should be effective. 
The Gemara responds: The apparent contradiction <span class="gemarra-regular">is not difficult</span>. That baraita refers to a case where he received a non-specific report, i.e., he was told that an unspecified relative died. In such a case his obligation to rend his garment has been discharged. And this mishna refers to a case where the bearer of the news mistakenly specified that his daughter had taken the vow, when in reality his wife had. In such a case, his nullification is ineffective.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught </span>similarly in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If <span class="gemarra-regular">they said to him </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">his father had die</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he rent </span>his garment over his death, <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward it was discovered </span>that it was not his father who died, but <span class="gemarra-regular">his son, he has not fulfilled </span>his obligation of <span class="gemarra-regular">rending </span>his garment. If, however, <span class="gemarra-regular">they said to him </span>that a relative <span class="gemarra-regular">of his had died</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and he thought it was his father and he rent </span>his garment over his death, <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward it was discovered </span>that it was not his father who died, but <span class="gemarra-regular">his son, he has fulfilled </span>his obligation of <span class="gemarra-regular">rending </span>his garment. This proves that a distinction is made between one who rends his garment relying on a specific report and one who does so following a non-specific report. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ashi says </span>that the discrepancy between the <span class="it-text">baraitot</span> with regard to the rending of garments can be reconciled in a different manner: <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>the person who rent his garment for the wrong relative realized his error <span class="gemarra-regular">within the time required for speaking </span>the short phrase: Greetings to you, my teacher. Until that time has passed his action is seen as incomplete and can therefore still be modified. <span class="gemarra-regular">There, </span>the mistake was noted only <span class="gemarra-regular">after the time required for speaking </span>a short phrase.
<span class="gemarra-regular">This </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">where you said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he has fulfilled </span>his obligation of <span class="gemarra-regular">rending </span>his garment even though he had initially been told explicitly that his father died, deals with a situation <span class="gemarra-regular">where it was discovered within the time required for speaking </span>a short phrase, i.e., immediately after he rent his garment, that the deceased was <span class="gemarra-regular">his son</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> However, <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>case, <span class="gemarra-regular">where you said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he has not fulfilled </span>his obligation of <span class="gemarra-regular">rending </span>his garment, deals with a situation where he became aware of his mistake <span class="gemarra-regular">after the time required for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">speaking</span> a short phrase, i.e., a short while later. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">And it is taught </span>in the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">One who has an ill </span>relative <span class="gemarra-regular">in his house, and </span>the latter <span class="gemarra-regular">fainte</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> and lost consciousness, <span class="gemarra-regular">and it seemed </span>to him <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> the ill person had <span class="gemarra-regular">died and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">he rent </span>his garment over his assumed death, if it turned out that he had not yet actually died at that point <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>it was only <span class="gemarra-regular">afterward </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he died, </span>the relative <span class="gemarra-regular">has not fulfilled </span>his obligation of <span class="gemarra-regular">rending </span>his garment. And with regard to this <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said in the name of Bar Kappara: They taught </span>that he has not fulfilled his obligation of rending <span class="gemarra-regular">only if </span>the ill person <span class="gemarra-regular">died after the time required for speaking </span>a short phrase. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if he passed away <span class="gemarra-regular">within the time required for speaking </span>a short phrase, <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>all considered <span class="gemarra-regular">like </span>continuous <span class="gemarra-regular">speech, </span>and his relative has fulfilled his obligation. That is to say, his act of rending is not viewed as complete until the time required for saying a short phrase has elapsed, and until that time has passed the act can still be modified. 
The Gemara concludes: <span class="gemarra-regular">And the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span> is: The legal status of a pause or retraction <span class="gemarra-regular">within </span>the time required <span class="gemarra-regular">for speaking </span>a short phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">is like </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">continuous speech, </span>and so a person can retract what he first said if he issues the retraction within this period of time after he finished speaking. This principle holds true in almost every area of <span class="it-text">halakha</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">except for </span>the case of one who <span class="gemarra-regular">blaspheme</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> God; <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>in the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">an idol worshipper</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who verbally accepts an idol as his god; <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">betroth</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> a woman; <span class="gemarra-regular">or </span>one who <span class="gemarra-regular">divorce</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span> his wife. In these four cases, a person cannot undo his action, even if he immediately retracts what he said within the time required for saying a short phrase. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Tasting these figs and grapes is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> and her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">upheld </span>her vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to figs, the entire </span>vow <span class="gemarra-regular">is upheld, </span>but if <span class="gemarra-regular">he nullified </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to figs it is not </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nullifie</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">until he also nullifies </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to grapes. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">she said: Tasting a fig and tasting a grape are </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">these are </span>viewed as <span class="gemarra-regular">two </span>separate <span class="gemarra-regular">vows; </span>if the husband upholds one of the vows it has no effect on the other one.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Whose </span>opinion is expressed in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna? </span>The Gemara answers: It follows the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, as it is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: The verse concerning vows that states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Her husband may uphold it, or her husband may nullify it” </span>(Numbers 30:14), may be expounded as follows. If a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">said: Tasting these figs and grapes is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for me, </span>and her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">upheld </span>her vow <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to figs, the entire </span>vow <span class="gemarra-regular">is upheld. </span>

Daf 87b

But if <span class="gemarra-regular">he nullified </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to figs, it is not nullified until he will also nullify </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for grapes. </span>This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says </span>that the verse <span class="gemarra-regular">states: “Her husband may uphold it, or her husband may nullify it.” Just as </span>the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“may uphold it” </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">y</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ekimennu</span>] should be understood as if they read: He may uphold <span class="gemarra-regular">part of it </span>[<span class="it-text">y</span><span class="it-text">akim</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">mimmennu</span>], implying that if he upheld part of the vow he has upheld all of it, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, </span>the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“he may nullify it” </span>[<span class="gemarra-italic">y</span><span class="gemarra-italic">eferennu</span>] should be understood as if they read: He may nullify <span class="gemarra-regular">part of it </span><span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="it-text">y</span><span class="it-text">afer</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">mimmennu</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]. And Rabbi Yishmael </span>retorts: <span class="gemarra-regular">Is it written: He may nullify part of it, </span>with a <span class="it-text">mem</span>, as it is written with respect to a husband who upholds the vow? <span class="gemarra-regular">And Rabbi Akiva </span>replies: The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposes nullification to upholding; just as upholding </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">part of it, so too, nullification </span>means <span class="gemarra-regular">part of it. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This</span> opinion, that a vow is treated as a single unit, so that the entire vow is upheld even if the husband upheld only a part of it, is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva. But the Rabbis say: </span>The verse <span class="gemarra-regular">juxtaposes upholding to nullification</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> just as </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">nullification, that which he nullified he has nullified, so too, </span>with regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">upholding, that which he upheld he has upheld, </span>but no more.
The mishna teaches that if a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>Tasting <span class="gemarra-regular">a fig </span>and tasting a grape are <span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, these are viewed as two separate vows. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: The mishna is </span>in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Shimon, as </span>Rabbi Shimon <span class="gemarra-regular">said </span>that that one is not liable to bring multiple offerings for taking false oaths to multiple people in the same utterance, for example, if he says: I take an oath that I do not have your item, nor yours, nor yours, <span class="gemarra-regular">unless he states </span>an expression of <span class="gemarra-regular">an oat</span><span class="gemarra-regular">h</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> to each and every on</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> of the creditors, for example by stating: I take an oath I do not have yours; I take an oath I do not have yours. Here too, only if she says: Tasting, with respect to each fruit are they viewed as two separate vows. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a man’s wife or daughter took a vow and he failed to nullify the vow on the day he heard it, but afterward he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I know that there are </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vows</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but I don’t know that there are those who </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify </span>them, i.e., he was unaware of the possibility of nullifying vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">he can nullify </span>the vow of his wife or his daughter on the day he learned that he can nullify vows. If, however, he said: <span class="gemarra-regular">I know there are those who </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify </span>vows, <span class="gemarra-regular">but </span>I refrained from nullifying the vow that I heard because <span class="gemarra-regular">I do not know that this </span>is considered <span class="gemarra-regular">a </span><span class="gemarra-regular">vow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir says he cannot </span><span class="gemarra-regular">nullif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> the vow at this point, <span class="gemarra-regular">but the Rabbis say </span>that even in this case <span class="gemarra-regular">he can nullify </span>the vow on the day that he learned of his mistake. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises a contradiction </span>from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to one who kills unintentionally, the verse states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Without seeing” </span>(Numbers 35:23), which serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude a blind </span><span class="gemarra-regular">perso</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> from the category of those who are exiled to a city of refuge due to having killed unintentionally, as the verse indicates that it was only in this instance that he did not see, but he is generally able to see. A blind person who kills another unintentionally is considered a victim of circumstances beyond his control. This is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says </span>the verse serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include a blind person </span>in the category of those who are exiled, as he too does not see. This shows that Rabbi Meir does not distinguish between different kinds of lack of knowledge, whereas the mishna suggests that he does accept such a distinction. The opposite is true of Rabbi Yehuda, who, unless it is otherwise indicated, is assumed to be Rabbi Meir’s disputant in all places. 

Daf 88a

<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: </span>There is no contradiction here, as the dispute with regard to an unintentional killing is based on divergent interpretations of the verse. <span class="gemarra-regular">Here, </span>the ruling follows <span class="gemarra-regular">from the context of the verse, and there, </span>the ruling follows <span class="gemarra-regular">from the context of the verse</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> Rabbi Yehuda maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>the exile of an unintentional <span class="gemarra-regular">killer it is written: “And a man who goes into the forest with his neighbor </span>to hew wood” (Deuteronomy 19:5), which serves to include <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">is capable of entering a forest, and a blind person is also is capable of entering a forest. And if you say </span>that the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“without seeing” </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include a blind person, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">derived from </span>the word <span class="gemarra-regular">“forest,” </span>as he too can enter a forest. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, learn from it </span>that the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“without seeing” </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude a blind person </span>from the category of unintentional killers who are exiled to a city of refuge. 
By contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir maintains: It is written </span>in that same section: “One who strikes his neighbor <span class="gemarra-regular">without knowledge” </span>(Deuteronomy 19:4), which indicates that the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> applies to <span class="gemarra-regular">anyone who is capable of knowing </span>the precise location of the people standing about him, <span class="gemarra-regular">but a blind person is not capable of knowing </span>this. <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“without seeing” </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to exclude a blind person, </span>this <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">derived from </span>the words <span class="gemarra-regular">“without knowledge.” Rather, learn from it </span>that the phrase <span class="gemarra-regular">“without seeing” </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include a blind person </span>in the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of exile, not to exclude him.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">one who vows </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit </span>from him is forbidden <span class="gemarra-regular">to his </span><span class="gemarra-regular">son-in-law</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">but he </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes to give his daughter,</span> i.e., the wife of that same son-in-law, <span class="gemarra-regular">money, </span>then, though he cannot do so directly, as anything acquired by a woman belongs to her husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>should <span class="gemarra-regular">say to her: This money is hereby given to you as a gift, provided that your husband has no rights to </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> but the gift includes <span class="gemarra-regular">only that which you pick </span><span class="gemarra-regular">u</span><span class="gemarra-regular">p</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and place in your mouth.</span>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">they taught </span>this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only </span>in a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where he</span> actually <span class="gemarra-regular">said to her: That which you pick up and place in your mouth </span>is yours. <span class="gemarra-regular">But </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: Do as you please </span>with the money, his stipulation is of no effect, and <span class="gemarra-regular">the husband acquires </span>the money. <span class="gemarra-regular">And Shmuel says </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">he said: Do as you </span><span class="gemarra-regular">pleas</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> with the money, <span class="gemarra-regular">the husband does not acquire it. Rabbi Zeira objects to this </span>statement of Rav: 

Daf 88b

<span class="gemarra-regular">In accordance with whose </span>opinion among the <span class="it-text">tanna’im</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">does Rav’s </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> correspond? </span>It is <span class="gemarra-regular">in accordance with </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir, who said </span>as a principle that <span class="gemarra-regular">the hand of a woma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> is like the hand of her husband</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> According to Rabbi Meir, a slave has no independent right of acquisition, and anything given to a slave belongs to his master even if it was stipulated otherwise (see <span class="it-text">Kiddushin</span> 23b). Rav assumes that similarly, a married woman has no independent right of acquisition, but rather, anything that she attempts to acquire for herself is automatically acquired by her husband. 
Rabbi Zeira continues: <span class="gemarra-regular">And raise a contradiction </span>from an unattributed mishna (<span class="it-text">Eiruvin</span> 73b), which presumably follows the opinion of Rabbi Meir: <span class="gemarra-regular">How does one merge </span>the courtyards that open <span class="gemarra-regular">into an alleywa</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> in order to permit its residents to carry on Shabbat from one courtyard to another in the same alley, if a person wishes to act on behalf of all the residents of the alleyway? <span class="gemarra-regular">He places a barrel </span>filled with his own food or wine <span class="gemarra-regular">and</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> says: This is for all the residents of the alleyway. </span>For this gift to be acquired by the others, someone must accept it on their behalf, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> therefore teaches that <span class="gemarra-regular">he may transfer possession to them </span>even <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of his Hebrew slave or maidservant, </span>whom he does not own, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of his adult son or daughter, and</span> similarly <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of his wife. </span>These people may acquire the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> food on behalf of all the residents of the alleyway. 
Rabbi Zeira states the contradiction: <span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that a woman’s <span class="gemarra-regular">husband acquires</span> anything given to her, <span class="gemarra-regular">the </span><span class="gemarra-italic">eiruv</span> food <span class="gemarra-regular">has </span>consequently <span class="gemarra-regular">not left the husband’s domain </span>when he gives it to his wife, for anything she acquires belongs to him. Rather, it can be seen from here that Rabbi Meir does not extend his principle from a slave to a married woman, in opposition of the ruling of Rav.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said </span>in response: <span class="gemarra-regular">Even though Rabbi Meir said</span> that in general <span class="gemarra-regular">the hand of a woman is like the hand of her husband, </span>in accordance with the ruling of Rav, <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Meir </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">concedes with regard to the merging </span>of alleyways <span class="gemarra-regular">that since </span><span class="gemarra-regular">it </span>is her aim <span class="gemarra-regular">to acquire </span>the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> food <span class="gemarra-regular">for other</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> from the hand of her husband, </span>and not to acquire it for herself, <span class="gemarra-regular">she can acquire </span>it from him for this purpose. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina raised an objection to Rav Ashi </span>from the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: <span class="gemarra-regular">These are </span>the people <span class="gemarra-regular">who can acquire </span><span class="it-text">eiruv</span> food <span class="gemarra-regular">on behalf of </span>others: The <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> food can be acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of his adult son or daughter, and </span>by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">his Hebrew slave or maidservant. And these are </span>the people <span class="gemarra-regular">who cannot acquire </span>an <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">on behalf of </span>others: The <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> food cannot be acquired <span class="gemarra-regular">by means of his minor son or daughter, or </span>by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">his Canaanite slave or maidservant, or </span>by means of <span class="gemarra-regular">his wife. </span>This indicates that a married woman does not have an independent right of acquisition to acquire the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> food on behalf of others, in opposition to the ruling of the mishna. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, Rav Ashi said: </span>In <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna</span> in <span class="it-text">Eiruvin</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">we are dealing with </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">who possesses a courtyard </span>of her own <span class="gemarra-regular">in that alleyway, </span>i.e., it is a case where the husband had earlier stipulated that she should have property of her own, to which he renounces all his rights. <span class="gemarra-regular">As, since she acquires</span> the <span class="it-text">eiruv</span> food <span class="gemarra-regular">for herself </span>by virtue of the courtyard that she owns in that alleyway, <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span>likewise <span class="gemarra-regular">acquires </span>it <span class="gemarra-regular">for others.</span>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The Torah states: <span class="gemarra-regular">“But every vow of a widow, and of her that is </span><span class="gemarra-regular">divorced</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> with which she has bound her soul, <span class="gemarra-regular">shall stand against her” </span>(Numbers 30:10). <span class="gemarra-regular">How so? </span>If a widow or divorced woman <span class="gemarra-regular">said: I am hereby a nazirite after thirty </span><span class="gemarra-regular">days</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> then <span class="gemarra-regular">even if she was married within thirty days, </span>her new husband <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot nullify </span>her vow. 

Daf 89a

If <span class="gemarra-regular">she took a vow while she was under the jurisdiction of </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">husband</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he can nullify </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">for her. How so? </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">she said </span>when she was still married: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby a nazirite for after thirty </span>days, and her husband nullified the vow, then <span class="gemarra-regular">even if she was widowed or divorced within </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">thirty-</span>day period, the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">is nullified. </span>If <span class="gemarra-regular">she took a vow on that, </span>i.e., one, <span class="gemarra-regular">da</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and was divorced on that </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">day, </span>then even if her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">took her back </span>as his wife <span class="gemarra-regular">on that </span>same <span class="gemarra-regular">day, he cannot nullify </span>her previous vows. <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the principle: Once she has left </span>and gone <span class="gemarra-regular">into her own jurisdiction </span>for even <span class="gemarra-regular">a single hour, </span>then after they are remarried her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can no </span>longer <span class="gemarra-regular">nullify </span>any vow she uttered during their first marriage.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">a widow or a divorcée who said: I am hereby a nazirite for when I will get </span><span class="gemarra-regular">married</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and she was married, Rabbi Yishmael says </span>her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>her vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas Rabbi Akiva says he cannot nullify </span>it. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the mnemonic </span>device for the opinions of Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva with regard to this <span class="it-text">halakha</span> and the following one is the Hebrew acronym <span class="gemarra-italic">yod</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-italic">lamed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">lamed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-italic">yod</span><span class="gemarra-regular">: </span><span class="it-text">Yafer</span>, <span class="it-text">lo</span> <span class="it-text">yafer</span>; <span class="it-text">lo</span> <span class="it-text">yafer</span>, <span class="it-text">yafer</span>, i.e., he can nullify, he cannot nullify; he cannot nullify, he can nullify. As for <span class="gemarra-regular">a married woman who said </span>while she was married: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby a nazirite for when I will get </span><span class="gemarra-regular">divorced</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and she was divorced, Rabbi Yishmael says </span>her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot nullify </span>her vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">whereas Rabbi Akiva says </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>it. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael said: It says: “But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced</span>…shall be upheld against her” (Numbers 30:10), which means that the practical application of <span class="gemarra-regular">the vow must be in the time of the </span>woman’s <span class="gemarra-regular">widowhood or divorce. </span>Only when the vow is to take effect when she is a widow or a divorce shall it be upheld against her, since then it is impossible to nullify. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva, </span>by contrast, <span class="gemarra-regular">maintains: It says: </span>“But every vow…<span class="gemarra-regular">with which she has bound her soul, </span>shall be upheld against her,” which means <span class="gemarra-regular">that the binding of the vow, </span>i.e., the taking of the vow creating the prohibition, <span class="gemarra-regular">must be at the time of </span>the woman’s <span class="gemarra-regular">widowhood or divorce. </span>
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Ḥisda said: The mishna </span>that links the possibility of nullification to the time of the taking of the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Akiva. Abaye said: Even </span>if <span class="gemarra-regular">you say </span>that the mishna follows the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Yishmael, </span>there is no difficulty, for <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna </span>is referring to a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">who made her </span>vow <span class="gemarra-regular">dependent on days</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., she specified that the vow should take effect after a fixed period of time. By contrast, the <span class="gemarra-italic">baraita</span> is referring to a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">who made her </span>vow <span class="gemarra-regular">dependent on marriage. </span>
In the case of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span>, since the woman explicitly connected the application of her vow to her marital status, the possibility of nullifying the vow depends on the time that the vow takes effect. But in the case of the mishna, where the application of the vow is tied to a particular date, it is possible that <span class="gemarra-regular">the days will be completed and she was not divorced, </span>or that <span class="gemarra-regular">the days will be completed and she was not married. </span>Since there is no inherent connection between her marriage and the vow, Rabbi Yishmael agrees that the possibility of nullification depends on the time when the vow was pronounced. 
§ The mishna in the previous chapter (71a) teaches that as long as a betrothed young woman has not gone out into her own jurisdiction for a single moment, her father and her husband can nullify her vows. The mishna in this chapter teaches the principle in the reverse: If she has gone out for even a single hour, her husband cannot nullify her vows. The Gemara addresses this repetition. The mishna of: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the principle, which is taught in </span>the chapter called: <span class="gemarra-regular">A betrothed young woman, </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the father went with the messengers of the husband </span>after handing over his daughter in marriage <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the messengers </span>of the <span class="gemarra-regular">father went with the messengers of the husband. In </span>the case of <span class="gemarra-regular">a betrothed young woman, </span>since the father or his messengers were still with her, she has not yet left her father’s jurisdiction, and nevertheless the mishna teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that her father and her husband can nullify her vows. </span>
The mishna of: <span class="gemarra-regular">This is the principle, which is taught in </span>this chapter, called: <span class="gemarra-regular">And these are the vows, </span>serves <span class="gemarra-regular">to include </span>a case where <span class="gemarra-regular">the father handed over </span>his daughter <span class="gemarra-regular">to the messengers of the husband</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> or </span>a case <span class="gemarra-regular">where the messengers of the father handed </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">over to the messengers of the husband. </span>Although neither the father nor his messengers accompanied her, and therefore she has been fully handed over to her husband, nevertheless, the mishna teaches <span class="gemarra-regular">that the husband cannot nullify previous </span>vows, i.e., vows that preceded their marriage.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <span class="gemarra-regular">nine young </span><span class="gemarra-regular">wome</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">whose vows are upheld </span>and cannot be nullified: If she took a vow when she was <span class="gemarra-regular">a grown </span><span class="gemarra-regular">woma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">and she is an </span><span class="gemarra-regular">orphan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">;</span> if she took a vow when she was <span class="gemarra-regular">a young woman, and has reached her majority, and she is an orphan; </span>

Daf 89b

if she took a vow when she was <span class="gemarra-regular">a young woman who had not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">reached her majority, and she is an orphan; </span>if she took a vow when she was <span class="gemarra-regular">a grown woman and her father died; </span>if she took a vow when she was <span class="gemarra-regular">a young woman, </span>and she became <span class="gemarra-regular">a grown woman, and her father died; </span>if she took a vow when she was <span class="gemarra-regular">a young woman who had not reached her majority, and her father died; </span>if she took a vow when she was <span class="gemarra-regular">a young woman, and her father died, and after her father died she reached her majority; </span>if she took a vow when she was <span class="gemarra-regular">a grown woman and her father is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">alive; </span>and if she took a vow when she was <span class="gemarra-regular">a young woman, </span>and she became <span class="gemarra-regular">a grown woman, and her father is </span>still <span class="gemarra-regular">alive. Rabbi Yehuda says: </span>With regard to <span class="gemarra-regular">even one who married off his minor daughter</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and she was widowed or divorced and she returned to him, </span>and according to her age <span class="gemarra-regular">she still </span>is in the category of <span class="gemarra-regular">a young woman, </span>her vows cannot be nullified.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Yehuda said </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav said: This </span>mishna is <span class="gemarra-regular">the statement of Rabbi </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Yehuda</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> who spelled out all the cases and listed nine young women whose vows are upheld. <span class="gemarra-regular">But the Rabbis say </span>that it is unnecessary to go into such detail. Instead, they simply said: There are <span class="gemarra-regular">three young women whose vows are upheld </span>and cannot be nullified: <span class="gemarra-regular">A grown woman, and an orphan, and an orphan in her father’s </span><span class="gemarra-regular">lifetime</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., a young woman who was divorced or widowed while her father was still alive and is considered an orphan in that her father no longer has jurisdiction over her.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a woman said to her husband: <span class="gemarra-regular">Deriving benefit from </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father or from your father is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for </span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">if I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">prepare </span>anything <span class="gemarra-regular">for you; </span>or if she said: <span class="gemarra-regular">Deriving benefit from you </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me if I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">prepare </span>anything <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father or for your father, </span>the husband <span class="gemarra-regular">can nullify </span>this vow. 
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">It is taught </span>in a <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If a woman said to her husband: <span class="gemarra-regular">Deriving benefit from </span>my <span class="gemarra-regular">father or from </span><span class="gemarra-regular">your father </span>is <span class="it-text">konam</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">for me if I </span>will <span class="gemarra-regular">prepare </span>anything <span class="gemarra-regular">for you, Rabbi Natan says </span>her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">cannot nullify </span>the vow. She must prepare food for him, as she is obligated to do so by virtue of their being married, and it is prohibited for her to benefit from their respective fathers. The husband cannot nullify a vow that has not yet taken effect and that depends on the fulfillment of a certain condition. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say </span>that even in such a case <span class="gemarra-regular">he can nullify </span>her vow. 
The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> continues: If the woman said to her husband: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am removed from the Jews, </span>i.e., the benefit of my engaging in sexual intercourse will be forbidden to all Jews, <span class="gemarra-regular">if I engage in sexual intercourse with you, Rabbi Natan says he cannot nullify </span>the vow. Rather, she must engage in sexual intercourse with her husband, as she is obligated to do so by virtue of their marriage, and she will be forbidden to all other Jews. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis say he can nullify </span>her vow.
§ It is related that there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain man who </span>took a vow that all <span class="gemarra-regular">benefit from the world should be forbidden to hi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">m</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> if </span>he <span class="gemarra-regular">marries a woman when he has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">learned </span><span class="gemarra-italic">halakha</span><span class="gemarra-regular">. He would run up a ladder and rop</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> but was not able to learn </span>the material, i.e., despite all his efforts he failed in his studies. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Aḥa bar Rav Huna came and misled him, </span>allowing him to understand that even if he took a vow, the vow would not take effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">he married a woman. </span>

Daf 90a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>Rav Aḥa bar Rav Huna then <span class="gemarra-regular">smeared him with cla</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> to protect him from the elements, as it was now prohibited for him to benefit from the world by wearing clothes. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>he then <span class="gemarra-regular">brought him before Rav Ḥisda, </span>to dissolve his vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: Who is wise </span>enough <span class="gemarra-regular">to act in this manner, if not Rav Aḥa bar Rav Huna</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who is a great man? As he</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> holds that just as the Rabbis and Rabbi Natan disagre</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with regard to nullification, </span>whether it is possible to nullify a vow that has yet to take effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">so too, they disagree with regard to a request </span>made to a halakhic authority to dissolve a vow, whether it is possible to request dissolution of such a vow. Rav Aḥa bar Rav Huna’s plan was to have the vow go into effect, so that the man could request that it be dissolved.
<span class="gemarra-regular">And Rav Pappi said </span>with regard to this issue: The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>between Rabbi Natan and the Rabbis is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to nullification </span>only, <span class="gemarra-regular">as </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan holds </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a husband can nullify </span>a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">only once the vow has taken effect, as it is written: “And the moon shall be confounded [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ḥafera</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]” </span>(Isaiah 24:23). He employs this phrase as an allusion, interpreting the word <span class="it-text">ḥafera</span> as if it were <span class="it-text">hafara</span>, nullification, and concludes from here that only a vow that already exists, like the moon, can be nullified. <span class="gemarra-regular">And the Rabbis hold </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">a husband can nullif</span><span class="gemarra-regular">y</span> a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">even though the vow has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">taken effect, as it is written: “He nullifies the thoughts of the crafty” </span>(Job 5:12), implying that nullification pertains even to thoughts, to prevent them from going into effect. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to a request </span>made to a halakhic authority to dissolve a vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone, </span>both Rabbi Natan and the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">agrees that a halakhic authority cannot dissolve anythin</span><span class="gemarra-regular">g</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> unless the vow has </span>already <span class="gemarra-regular">taken effect, as it is written: “He shall not profan</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> his word” </span>(Numbers 30:3), which indicates that the person himself who took the vow cannot profane his words and dissolve his vow, but a halakhic authority may do so. This, however, applies only if the vow has already gone into effect, as it says: “His word.”
The Gemara suggests: <span class="gemarra-regular">Let us say </span>that the following <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>Rav Pappi’s opinion: If one says: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">of so-and-so </span><span class="gemarra-regular">is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not benefit </span>from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>deriving benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">he who I will request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the vow is also <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, then, if he desires to dissolve the vows <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>must first <span class="gemarra-regular">request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the first </span>vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the second. And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one can request </span>dissolution of a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">even though the vow has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">taken effect, </span>why must he request dissolution of his two vows in the above order? <span class="gemarra-regular">If he </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes, he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">first request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span>vow, and <span class="gemarra-regular">if he wishes, he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">first request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to that </span>one. 
The Gemara refutes this argument: <span class="gemarra-regular">And does he know if this </span>vow <span class="gemarra-regular">is first </span>or <span class="gemarra-regular">if that </span>vow <span class="gemarra-regular">is last? </span>The <span class="it-text">baraita</span> does not specify which vow is first and which is last. Perhaps first and last is referring not to the order in which the two vows were taken, but rather to the order in which they are dissolved, so that if he so wishes, he can first request dissolution of the vow not to derive benefit from the halakhic authority from whom he will request dissolution of his vow. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, let us say </span>that a different <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">supports </span>Rav Pappi’s opinion: If one says: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">of so-and-so is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not benefit </span>from it, and <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby a nazirit</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for when I will request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>this vow, if he desires to dissolve the vows <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>must first <span class="gemarra-regular">request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to his vow </span>not to derive benefit from a particular person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to his </span>vow of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship </span>that he accepted upon himself should he request dissolution of his first vow.  
<span class="gemarra-regular">And if you say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">one </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">request </span>dissolution of a vow <span class="gemarra-regular">even though the vow has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">taken effect, </span>why must the two vows be dissolved in that order? <span class="gemarra-regular">If he </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes, he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">first request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to his vow </span>not to derive benefit from that other person, and <span class="gemarra-regular">if he wishes, he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">first request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to his </span>vow of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship. </span>The Gemara rejects this argument: This is no proof, as it is possible that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>taught in accordance with the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rabbi Natan, </span>who maintains that a vow can be nullified only after it has gone into effect. The Rabbis, however, dispute this view.
<span class="gemarra-regular">Ravina said: Mareimar said to me: This is </span>what <span class="gemarra-regular">your father said in the name of Rav Pappi</span><span class="gemarra-regular">:</span> The <span class="gemarra-regular">dispute </span>between Rabbi Natan and the Rabbis is <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to nullification </span>only, as Rabbi Natan holds that a husband can nullify a vow only once the vow has taken effect, whereas the Rabbis hold that a husband can nullify a vow even though the vow has not yet taken effect. <span class="gemarra-regular">But with regard to a request </span>made to a halakhic authority to dissolve a vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">everyone, </span>both Rabbi Natan and the Rabbis, <span class="gemarra-regular">agrees, </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">he can dissolve </span>the vow <span class="gemarra-regular">even though the vow has not </span>yet <span class="gemarra-regular">taken effect. As it is written: “He shall not profane his word” </span>(Numbers 30:3), which Ravina expounds as follows: 

Daf 90b

<span class="gemarra-regular">That is to say that there was not </span>yet any <span class="gemarra-regular">action </span>but only speech, and even so the halakhic authority can dissolve the vow. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises an objection </span>against this version of the tannaitic dispute from the aforementioned <span class="it-text">baraita</span>: If one says: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">of so-and-so is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that</span> reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not benefit </span>from it, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>deriving benefit from <span class="gemarra-regular">he who I will request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">for </span>the vow is also <span class="it-text">konam</span> for me, if he desires to dissolve the vows <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>must first <span class="gemarra-regular">request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the first </span>vow, <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to the second. </span>But according to what was stated above, that all agree that a vow can be dissolved even before it has taken effect, <span class="gemarra-regular">why </span>is this so? <span class="gemarra-regular">If he </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes, he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">first request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to this </span>vow, and <span class="gemarra-regular">if he wishes, he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">first request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to that </span>one. 
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Does he know which </span>vow <span class="gemarra-regular">is first and which is </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">second? </span>The wording of the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> is not at all clear on this point. Perhaps, if he so wishes, he can first request dissolution of the vow not to derive benefit from the halakhic authority from whom he will request dissolution of his vow. 
The Gemara <span class="gemarra-regular">raises </span>a further <span class="gemarra-regular">objection </span>from the second <span class="it-text">baraita</span> cited above: If one says: The property <span class="gemarra-regular">of so-and-so is </span><span class="gemarra-italic">konam</span> for me, and for <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>reason <span class="gemarra-regular">I will not benefit </span>from it, and <span class="gemarra-regular">I am hereby a nazirite for when I will request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>this vow, if he desires to dissolve the vows <span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>must first <span class="gemarra-regular">request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to his vow </span>that rendered benefit from a particular person forbidden, <span class="gemarra-regular">and afterward </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to his </span>vow of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship </span>that he accepted upon himself should he request dissolution of his first vow. <span class="gemarra-regular">But why </span>must he proceed in this manner? <span class="gemarra-regular">If he </span>so <span class="gemarra-regular">wishes he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">first request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to his vow </span>not to derive benefit from that other person, <span class="gemarra-regular">and if he wishes he </span>can <span class="gemarra-regular">first request </span>dissolution <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to his </span>vow of <span class="gemarra-regular">naziriteship. </span>The fact that the <span class="it-text">baraita</span> does not say this indicates that a vow can be dissolved only once it has gone into effect. The Gemara concludes: Here is <span class="gemarra-regular">a conclusive refutatio</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> of this version of the dispute between Rabbi Natan and the Rabbis. 
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">Initially </span>the Sages <span class="gemarra-regular">would say </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">three women are divorced </span>even against their husbands’ will, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>nevertheless <span class="gemarra-regular">they receive </span>payment of what is due to them according to their <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract. </span>The first is the wife of a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>to her husband: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am defiled to you, </span>i.e., she claims that she had been raped, so that she is now forbidden to her husband. The second is a woman who says to her husband: <span class="gemarra-regular">Heaven is between me and </span><span class="gemarra-regular">you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., she declares that he is impotent, a claim she cannot prove, as the truth of it is known only to God. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>the third is a woman who takes a vow, stating: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am removed from the </span><span class="gemarra-regular">Jews</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., benefit from sexual intercourse with any Jew, including my husband, is forbidden to me. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">They </span>subsequently <span class="gemarra-regular">retracted </span>their words <span class="gemarra-regular">and said </span>that in order <span class="gemarra-regular">that </span>a married <span class="gemarra-regular">woman should not cast her eyes on another </span>man <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>to that end <span class="gemarra-regular">ruin </span>her relationship <span class="gemarra-regular">with her husband </span>and still receive payment of her marriage contract, these <span class="it-text">halakhot</span> were modified as follows: A priest’s wife <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>to her husband: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am defiled to you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> must bring proo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">f </span><span class="gemarra-regular"> for her words </span>that she was raped. As for a woman who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Heaven is between me and you</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> the court <span class="gemarra-regular">must act </span>and deal with the matter <span class="gemarra-regular">by way of a request</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> rather than force the husband to divorce his wife. <span class="gemarra-regular">And </span>with regard to a woman who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am removed from the Jews</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> her husband <span class="gemarra-regular">must nullify his part, </span>i.e., the aspect of the vow that concerns him, so that she should be permitted to him, <span class="gemarra-regular">and she may engage in sexual intercourse with him, but she is removed from </span>all other <span class="gemarra-regular">Jews, </span>so that if he divorces her she is forbidden to all.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages, based on the second ruling of the mishna: If the wife of a priest <span class="gemarra-regular">said to her husband: I am defiled </span>to you, <span class="gemarra-regular">what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to </span>whether <span class="gemarra-regular">she may partake of </span><span class="gemarra-italic">teruma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span> Is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that just as she is not believed with regard to divorce, so she is not believed with regard to <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, or is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that with regard to <span class="it-text">teruma</span> she is believed, and therefore it is prohibited for her to partake of <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, as is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> of a woman married to a priest who engages in sexual intercourse with a man other than her husband? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Sheshet said: </span>She <span class="gemarra-regular">may partake </span>of <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, <span class="gemarra-regular">so that she not cast aspersions on her children. </span>If she is barred from partaking of <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, people will see this as supporting her claim that she had been raped, and rumors will circulate that her sons are unfit for the priesthood. <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: She </span><span class="gemarra-regular">may not partake </span>of <span class="it-text">teruma</span>, as <span class="gemarra-regular">she can partake of non-sacred </span>food, and it is preferable that her claim that she is no longer permitted to eat <span class="it-text">teruma</span> be taken into account. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said: And Rav Sheshet concedes that if </span>this wife of the priest who claimed to have been raped <span class="gemarra-regular">was </span>then <span class="gemarra-regular">widowed </span>from him, <span class="gemarra-regular">she may not </span>continue to <span class="gemarra-regular">partake </span>of <span class="it-text">teruma</span>. Why? <span class="gemarra-regular">Isn’t the reason </span>that she is permitted to partake of <span class="it-text">teruma</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">only that she </span>should not <span class="gemarra-regular">cast aspersions on her children? </span>This being the case, if she <span class="gemarra-regular">was widowed or divorced, </span>people <span class="gemarra-regular">will say </span>that only <span class="gemarra-regular">now </span>it occurred <span class="gemarra-regular">that she was raped, </span>i.e., the entire incident occurred after she was no longer married to her husband. Therefore, rumors will not circulate that the children that she bore him beforehand are unfit.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Pappa said: Rava tested us </span>with the following question: As for the <span class="gemarra-regular">wife of a priest who was rape</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span> in the presence of witnesses, is <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span>entitled to <span class="gemarra-regular">receive </span>payment of her <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract or </span>is <span class="gemarra-regular">she not </span>entitled to <span class="gemarra-regular">receive </span>payment of her <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract?</span> The Gemara explains the two sides of the question: Is the <span class="it-text">halakha</span> that <span class="gemarra-regular">since rape with regard to </span>a woman married to <span class="gemarra-regular">a priest is like willing </span>sexual intercourse <span class="gemarra-regular">with regard to a </span>woman married to <span class="gemarra-regular">an Israelite, </span>as the wife of a priest who was raped is obligated to leave her husband, just as the wife of an Israelite who willingly engaged in sexual intercourse with another man is obligated to leave her husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">she </span>is therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">not </span>entitled to <span class="gemarra-regular">receive </span>payment of her <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract? Or perhaps she can say to him: I am fit </span>to continue being married, as, if her husband were an Israelite she would not be forbidden to him after being raped. 

Daf 91a

<span class="gemarra-regular">And it is the man, </span>her husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">whose field was flooded. </span>In other words, like one whose field was flooded and destroyed, it is he who has suffered a natural disaster, as it is his status as a priest that forces him to divorce his wife. Therefore, she is entitled to receive payment of her marriage contract. <span class="gemarra-regular">And we said to </span>Rava, in response to his question: The answer to your question <span class="gemarra-regular">is </span>found in <span class="gemarra-regular">the mishna, </span>which states: A woman <span class="gemarra-regular">who says </span>to her husband: <span class="gemarra-regular">I am defiled to you, </span>is entitled to <span class="gemarra-regular">receive </span>payment of her <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract. </span>
The Gemara analyzes the mishna: <span class="gemarra-regular">With what are we dealing? If we say </span>the mishna is speaking <span class="gemarra-regular">of the wife of an Israelite, </span>consider the following: <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>she claims that she engaged in sexual intercourse <span class="gemarra-regular">willingly, does she have any </span>right to receive payment of her <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract</span><span class="gemarra-regular">?</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> And if </span>she says it was <span class="gemarra-regular">by force, </span>i.e., she was raped, <span class="gemarra-regular">is she </span>thereby <span class="gemarra-regular">forbidden to the man</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span>i.e., her husband? <span class="gemarra-regular">But rather, </span>the mishna must be referring to <span class="gemarra-regular">the wife of a priest. </span>Again, what are the circumstances? <span class="gemarra-regular">If </span>she claims that she engaged in sexual intercourse <span class="gemarra-regular">willingly, does she have any </span>right to receive payment of her <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract? Is her </span>law <span class="gemarra-regular">any less </span>stringent <span class="gemarra-regular">than </span>that of <span class="gemarra-regular">the wife of an Israelite </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">willingly </span>engaged in sexual intercourse with another man? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rather, is it not </span>that the sexual intercourse was <span class="gemarra-regular">by force? And </span>the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">she has </span>a right to receive payment of her <span class="gemarra-regular">marriage contract</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> This answers Rava’s question.
§ <span class="gemarra-regular">A dilemma was raised before </span>the Sages: If a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">said to her husband: You divorced me</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> what is </span>the <span class="it-text">halakha</span>? Is she believed or not? <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna said: Come </span>and <span class="gemarra-regular">hear </span>an answer to this question from what is stated in the mishna about a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">who says: I am defiled to you, that even according to the ultimate </span>version of the <span class="gemarra-regular">mishna that teaches </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">she is not believed </span>in her claim, it may be argued that <span class="gemarra-regular">it is </span>only <span class="gemarra-regular">there that she is </span>suspected of <span class="gemarra-regular">lying </span>when she claims to have been defiled, <span class="gemarra-regular">as she knows that her husband does not know </span>the truth <span class="gemarra-regular">about her. </span>She is relating an incident that supposedly occurred in his absence. <span class="gemarra-regular">But concerning </span>the claim: <span class="gemarra-regular">You divorced me, with regard to which he knows </span>the truth <span class="gemarra-regular">about </span>whether or not he actually divorced <span class="gemarra-regular">her, </span>she <span class="gemarra-regular">is believed</span><span class="gemarra-regular">.</span> Why? <span class="gemarra-regular">Because</span> the court relies on the <span class="gemarra-regular">presumption that a woman is not braze</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span> enough to lie <span class="gemarra-regular">in the presence of her husband </span>and present a claim that he knows is patently false. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rava said to him: On the contrary, even according to the initial </span>version of the <span class="gemarra-regular">mishna that teaches </span>that the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">is believed </span>in her claim that she is defiled to her husband, it may be argued that it is only <span class="gemarra-regular">there </span>that she is believed, <span class="gemarra-regular">because </span>a woman <span class="gemarra-regular">would not demean herself </span>by claiming she was raped if she were not telling the truth. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, where it is sometimes hard for her under </span>the authority of <span class="gemarra-regular">the man</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., her husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">she would be brazen </span>to his face, and therefore the court does not believe her. 
<span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Mesharshiyya raised an objection: </span>Let the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">initial </span>version of the <span class="gemarra-regular">mishna, </span>with regard to a woman who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Heaven is between me and you, </span>be a <span class="gemarra-regular">conclusive refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, </span>as <span class="gemarra-regular">here she </span>suffers <span class="gemarra-regular">no embarrassment </span>on account of her claim, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that </span>she <span class="gemarra-regular">is believed. </span>The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">there, since it is not sufficient for her </span>if she does <span class="gemarra-regular">not state </span>in precise detail her claim that <span class="gemarra-regular">he does not shoot like an arrow</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> i.e., his semen is not emitted forcefully, then, <span class="gemarra-regular">were it not as she said, she would not say it. </span>She would be too ashamed to speak of such things before the court. It is for this reason that she is believed.
The Gemara further comments: Let the ruling <span class="gemarra-regular">of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">ultimate </span>version of the <span class="gemarra-regular">mishna, </span>with regard to a woman who says: <span class="gemarra-regular">Heaven is between me and you, be </span>a <span class="gemarra-regular">conclusive refutation of </span>the opinion of <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna, </span>who maintains that a woman who claims that her husband divorced her is believed. <span class="gemarra-regular">But here, </span>as in the case of the alleged divorce, <span class="gemarra-regular">she knows and her husband </span>also <span class="gemarra-regular">knows with regard to her </span>whether or not she is lying, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>yet the <span class="it-text">tanna</span> of the mishna <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches that she is not believed. </span>
The Gemara answers: <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Hamnuna maintains </span>that <span class="gemarra-regular">here too, </span>the woman <span class="gemarra-regular">herself says </span>in her heart: <span class="gemarra-regular">Though he may know </span>whether or not we engaged <span class="gemarra-regular">in sexual intercourse, does he know </span>whether or not <span class="gemarra-regular">he shoots like an arrow? And </span>it is <span class="gemarra-regular">due to that </span>reason that <span class="gemarra-regular">she lies. </span>Since the woman can make a false claim against her husband without having to fear that he will contradict her, she is not believed. A similar point cannot be made in the case of an alleged divorce, as the husband knows whether or not he divorced his wife, and therefore a woman who claims that her husband divorced her is believed. 
§ It is related that there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain woman</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who </span>on <span class="gemarra-regular">every day of </span>engaging in <span class="gemarra-regular">sexual intercourse </span>with her husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">would rise early </span>in the morning <span class="gemarra-regular">and wash </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">husband’s hands. One day she brought him water to wash </span>his hands, in response to which <span class="gemarra-regular">he said to her: This matter, </span>i.e., sexual intercourse, <span class="gemarra-regular">did not occur now. She said to him: If so, </span>it may be that <span class="gemarra-regular">one of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">gentile </span>

Daf 91b

<span class="gemarra-regular">alo</span><span class="gemarra-regular">e</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> merchants [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">ahaloyei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who were here </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">now </span>should be blamed; <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">not you, perhaps </span>it was one <span class="gemarra-regular">of them. </span>The case came before <span class="gemarra-regular">Rav Naḥman, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: </span>There is reason to suspect that <span class="gemarra-regular">she might have cast her eyes upon another </span>man, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">there is no substance to her words. </span>She lacks credibility and her statement is unreliable, and so she remains permitted to her husband.
It is further related that there was <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain woman who was displease</span><span class="gemarra-regular">d</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> with </span>her <span class="gemarra-regular">man. He said to her: What is different now? </span>What have I done to make you angry? <span class="gemarra-regular">She said to him: </span>I am upset because <span class="gemarra-regular">you never hurt me </span>while we were engaged <span class="gemarra-regular">in proper relations as </span>you did just <span class="gemarra-regular">now. He said to her: This matter did not occur now. She said to him: If so, </span>it may be that <span class="gemarra-regular">one of </span>the <span class="gemarra-regular">gentile oil merchants [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">naftoyei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who were here </span>just <span class="gemarra-regular">now </span>should be blamed; <span class="gemarra-regular">if </span>it was <span class="gemarra-regular">not you, perhaps </span>it was one <span class="gemarra-regular">of them. Rav Naḥman said to them: Take no notice of her; she has cast her eyes upon another </span>man, and her words are therefore unreliable. 
The Gemara relates another incident about <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain ma</span><span class="gemarra-regular">n</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> who was secluding </span>himself <span class="gemarra-regular">[</span><span class="gemarra-italic">meharzeik</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> in a house</span><span class="gemarra-regular">, </span><span class="gemarra-regular">he and a </span>certain married <span class="gemarra-regular">woman. </span>When <span class="gemarra-regular">the owner of the house entered, the adulterer burst through the wall of palm branche</span><span class="gemarra-regular">s</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> and fled. Rava said: The woman is permitted </span>to her husband. The assumption is that she did not sin, for <span class="gemarra-regular">if it is so that </span>the man <span class="gemarra-regular">had committed a transgression, he would have hidden </span>himself in the house instead of revealing his identity by escaping in the open. 
The Gemara concludes with one final incident about <span class="gemarra-regular">a certain adulterer who entered </span>the house <span class="gemarra-regular">of a certain </span>married <span class="gemarra-regular">woman. </span>When <span class="gemarra-regular">the man, </span>i.e., her husband, <span class="gemarra-regular">came </span>home, the <span class="gemarra-regular">adulterer went and sat himself behind the door, </span>so that the husband would not know that he was there. <span class="gemarra-regular">There was </span>some <span class="gemarra-regular">cress [</span><span class="gemarra-italic">taḥlei</span><span class="gemarra-regular">]</span><span class="gemarra-regular"> lying there </span>in the house, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the adulterer, but not the husband, saw that <span class="gemarra-regular">a snake </span>had come and <span class="gemarra-regular">tasted of it</span><span class="gemarra-regular">,</span> perhaps thereby contaminating it with its venom. <span class="gemarra-regular">The master of the house wanted to eat from that cress, without the woman’s knowledge. The adulterer said to him: Do not eat from </span>the cress, <span class="gemarra-regular">as a snake has tasted of it. </span>
The case was brought before <span class="gemarra-regular">Rava, </span>who <span class="gemarra-regular">said: His wife is permitted </span>to him, for <span class="gemarra-regular">were it so that </span>the adulterer <span class="gemarra-regular">had committed a transgression, it would have been preferable for him that </span>the husband should <span class="gemarra-regular">eat </span>the cress <span class="gemarra-regular">and die. </span>This is because one who commits adultery is also suspected of bloodshed, <span class="gemarra-regular">as it is written: “For they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands” </span>(Ezekiel 23:45), indicating that adultery leads to murder. 
The Gemara comments: It <span class="gemarra-regular">is obvious </span>that this is the case. What then does Rava come to teach us? The Gemara answers: Rava’s ruling is necessary, <span class="gemarra-regular">lest you say </span>that the man did in fact <span class="gemarra-regular">commit a transgression </span>with the other man’s wife, <span class="gemarra-regular">and </span>the reason <span class="gemarra-regular">that he said to </span>the husband that he should not eat and saved his life is <span class="gemarra-regular">because it is preferable for him that the husband should not die. </span>This is in order <span class="gemarra-regular">that his wife should be to him </span>as it says in the verse: <span class="gemarra-regular">“Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant” </span>(Proverbs 9:17). That is to say, a person derives greater pleasure from forbidden fruit. Rava therefore <span class="gemarra-regular">teaches us </span>that this is not a concern. Rather, the assumption is that he had not yet actually sinned and therefore acted in the proper manner.
