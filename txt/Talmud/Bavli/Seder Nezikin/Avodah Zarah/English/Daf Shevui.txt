Avodah Zarah



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

On the three days preceding the festivals of idolaters, it is forbidden to conduct business with them, to lend articles to them or borrow from them, to lend or borrow any money from them, to repay a debt, or receive repayment from them. 
Rabbi Judah says: 
we should receive repayment from them, as this can only depress them; 
But they [the Rabbis] said to him:
even though it is depressing at the time, they are glad of it subsequently.
