Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

On the three days preceding the festivals of idolaters, it is forbidden to conduct business with them, to lend articles to them or borrow from them, to lend or borrow any money from them, to repay a debt, or receive repayment from them. 
Rabbi Judah says: 
we should receive repayment from them, as this can only depress them; 
But they [the Rabbis] said to him:
even though it is depressing at the time, they are glad of it subsequently.
GEMARA. Rav and Shmuel: 
One taught edehem (with an aleph) 
while the other taught edehem (with an ayin).
The one who taught edehem (with an aleph) is not in error while the one who taught edehem (with an ayin) is not in error.
The one who taught edehem (with an aleph) is not in error, as it is written:
“For the day of their calamity is at hand” (Deuteronomy 32:35);
And the one who taught edehem (with an ayin) is not in error, as it is written:
“Let them bring their witnesses [testimonies] that they may be justified” (Isaiah 43:9).
The one who taught edehem (with an aleph) why did he not teach edehem (with an ayin?
He could say:
Calamity is preferable.
he one who taught edehem (with an ayin) why did he not teach edehem (with an aleph)?
He might say:
What is it that brings about that calamity? The testimony they testify about themselves. Therefore testimony is preferable.
But does the verse, “Let them bring their witnesses that they may be justified,” refer to idolaters? It is written 
about Israel; as R. Joshua b. Levi said:
All the commandments which Israel performs in this world will come and testify on their behalf in the world to come, as it is said:
“Let them bring their witnesses that they may be justified” — this refers to Israel; “And let them hear and say: It is true” this refers the idolaters.
Rather, R. Huna the son of R. Joshua said
that the one who says edehem with an aleph derives it from here:
“They that fashion a graven image are all nothing, and their delectable things shall not profit, and their own witnesses see not” (Isaiah 44:9).
Hanina b. Papa and some say R. Simlai expounded:
In the time to come, the Holy Blessed One will take a Torah scroll and place it in His embrace and proclaim:
“Let him who has occupied himself with it, come and take his reward.”
Thereupon all the nations will come and gather in confusion, as it is said, 
“All the nations are gathered together” etc. (Isaiah 43:9). The Holy Blessed One will then say to them:
“Do not come before Me in confusion, but let each nation 

Daf 2b

come in with its scribes;” as it is said,
“And let the peoples (le’umim) be gathered together,” (ibid.) and the word peoples means a kingdom, as it is written,
“And one kingdom [u-leom] shall be stronger than the other kingdom” (Genesis 25:23).
But can there be confusion in the presence of the Holy Blessed One?
Rather it is only that they be not confused, and so hear what He says to them.
Thereupon the Kingdom of Rome entered first.
Why first?
Because they are the most important.
How do we know they are most important?
Because it is written:
“And he shall devour the whole earth and shall tread it down and break it in pieces” (Daniel 7:23) and R. Yohanan says:
This refers to Rome, whose power is known to the whole world.
And from where do we know that the most important ones come in [for judgment] first?
This is in accordance with R. Hisda, for R. Hisda said:
When a king and a community appear before the [Heavenly] tribunal, the king enters first, as it is said:
“To perform the sentence of his servant [King Solomon] and [then] the sentence of His people Israel.”
And what is the reason?
You may say, 
because it is not the way of the world that a king should wait outside; or you may say
[in order that the king shall plead] before the anger [of the Judge] is roused.
The Holy Blessed One will then say to them:
“With what have you occupied yourselves?”
They will reply:
“Master of the Universe, we have established many market-places, we have built many bathhouses, we have accumulated much gold and silver, and all this we did only for the sake of Israel, that they might [have leisure] for occupying themselves with the study of the Torah.”
The Holy Blessed One will say in reply:
“You foolish ones in the world, all that which you have done, you have only done to satisfy your own desires. You have established marketplaces to place prostitutes in them; baths, to delight yourself in them; silver and gold, that is mine, 
as it is said:
“Mine is the silver and Mine is the gold, says the Lord of Hosts” (Haggai 2:8).
Are there any among you who have been declaring this?
As it is said,
“Who among you declares this? (Isaiah 43:9).
And “this” is nothing but Torah, as it is said:
“And this is the Torah which Moses set before the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 4:44).
They will then depart crushed in spirit.
The kingdom of Rome goes out and the kingdom of Persia enters.
Why Persia next?
Because they are next in importance.
And how do we know this?
Because it is written:
“And behold another beast, a second like a bear” (Daniel 7:5);  and R. Joseph said:
This refers to the Persians, who eat and drink greedily like a bear, are fleshly like a bear, have shaggy hair like a bear, and are restless like a bear.
The Holy Blessed One will ask of them:
“With what have you occupied yourselves?
 and they will reply,
“Master of the Universe, we have built many bridges, we have captured many cities, we have waged many wars, and all this for the sake of Israel, that they might engage in the study of the Torah.”
The Holy Blessed One will say in reply:
“All that which you have done, you have only done to satisfy your own desires. You have made bridges, to collect taxes on them; cities, to raise in them the head-tax; wars, I make, as it is said: “The Lord is  a man of war” (Exodus 15:3). Are there any among you who have been declaring this?
As it is said,
“Who among you declares this? (Isaiah 43:9).
And “this” is nothing but Torah, as it is said:
“And this is the Torah which Moses set before the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 4:44).
They will then depart crushed in spirit.
But after the Persians saw that the Romans did not achieve anything, why did they go in?
They will say to themselves:
“The Romans have destroyed the Temple, whereas we have built it.”  
And so too every nation.
But after they saw that the first ones did not achieve anything, why should the other nations come forth?
They will say to themselves:
The others have oppressed Israel, but we have not.  
And why are these [two] nations singled out as important, and not the others?
Because their reign will last till the coming of the Messiah.
The nations will then say:
“Master of the Universe, have you given us the Torah, and have we declined to accept it?”
But how can they argue this,
is it not written,
“The Lord came from Sinai and rose from Seir to them, He shined forth from Mount Paran?” (Deuteronomy 33:2), and it is also written,
“God will come from Teman” (Habbakuk 3:3).
What did He want in Seir, and what did He want at Mount Paran?
R. Yohanan says:
This teaches us that the Holy Blessed One offered the Torah to every nation and every tongue, but none accepted it, until He came to Israel who received it.
Rather, this is what they will say to Him:
“Did we accept it and fail to observe it?”
But surely to this the response would be: “Then why did you not accept it?”
Rather, this is what they will say to Him:
“Master of the Universe, did you hold the mountain over us like a tub as You did to Israel and did we still decline to accept it?”
As it is written:
“And they stood at the foot (or under) the mountain” (Exodus 19:17), R. Dimi b. Hama said:
This teaches us that the Holy Blessed One suspended the mountain over Israel like a tub, and said to them:
“If you accept the Torah, it will be well with you, but if not, there you will find your grave.”
Thereupon God will say to them:
“Let them tell us of the former deeds,” as it is said,
“And let them tell us of the former deeds.” The seven commandments which you did accept, did you observe them?
How do we know that they did not observe them?
For R. Joseph taught:
“He stood and shook the earth, He saw and made the nations tremble” (Habbakuk 3:6).
What did He see? He saw that the nations did not observe even the seven commandments which the sons of Noah had taken upon themselves, and seeing that they did not observe them, He stood up and released them from them.
They benefited!
If so, it pays to be a sinner!
Mar the son of Rabina said:

Daf 3a

This says that even if they kept them, they do not receive reward for them.
But they do not?
Has it not been taught: R. Meir used to say:
From where do we know that even a non-Jew who studies the Torah is equal to a High Priest?
Scripture says:
“You shall therefore keep My statutes and My ordinances which, if a man do, he shall live by them” (Leviticus 18:5). Priests, Levites, or Israelites is not stated here, rather “a man.” This teaches you that even a non-Jew who studies the Torah is equal to a High Priest!”
Rather this teaches that they are not rewarded as greatly as one who does a thing which he is commanded to do, but rather as one who does a thing he is not commanded to do. For, R. Hanina said:
One who is commanded and does is greater than one who is not commanded and does
The nations will then say,
“Master of the Universe, has Israel, who accepted the Torah, observed it? 
The Holy Blessed One will reply,
“I can give testify that they observed the Torah.”
Then they will say back to Him, 
“Master of the Universe, can a father testify on behalf of his son?
For it is written,
“Israel is My son, My firstborn” (Exodus 4:22).
Then will the Holy Blessed One will say:
“Heaven and Earth testify that Israel has fulfilled the entire Torah.”
Then they will say:
Master of the Universe, Heaven and Earth are partial witnesses, for it is said,
“If I have not made My covenant with day and with night and established the laws of heaven and earth” (Jeremiah 33:25). And R. Shimon b. Lakish further said: What is it that is written,
“And there was evening and there was morning the sixth day?” (Genesis 1:31).
This teaches that God made a condition with the works of creation, saying, 
“If Israel accept my Law it will be well, but if not, I shall reduce you to a state of chaos.”
And this resonates with R Hezekiah 
who said,
“You caused sentence to be heard from Heaven, the earth trembled and was still” (Psalms 76:9).
If the earth trembled, how could it be still, and if it was still, how could it tremble?
Rather at first it trembled, and subsequently it became still.
Then the Holy Blessed One will say:
You yourselves shall testify that Israel observed the entire Torah.
Let Nimrod come and testify that Abraham did not worship idols; let Lavan come and testify that Jacob was not suspected of theft; let Potiphar's wife testify that Joseph was not suspected of sinning; let  Nebuchadnezzar come and testify that Hanania, Mishael and Azariah did not bow down to an image; let Darius come and testify that Daniel never neglected the prayers; let Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and Eliphaz the Temanite [and Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite] testify that Israel has observed the whole Torah; as it is said,
“Let them [the nations] bring their [own] witnesses, that they [Israel] may be justified” (Isaiah 43:9). 
The nations will then say:
Offer us the Torah anew and we shall obey it. 
But the Holy Blessed One will say to them,
You foolish ones among peoples, he who took trouble [to prepare] on the eve of Shabbat can eat on Shabbat, but he who has not troubled on the eve of Shabbat, what shall he eat on Shabbat?
Nevertheless, I have an easy command which is called Sukkah; go and carry it out.
But how can you say this:
Did not R. Joshua b. Levi say: What is it that it is written, 
“Which I command you this day” (Deuteronomy 7:11)? Today is the
day to do them, and tomorrow is not the day to do them. Today is the day to perform them, but today is not the day to take reward for their performance.
Rather, the Holy Blessed One does not deal harshly with His creatures.
And why does He term it an easy commandment?
Because it does not cause a financial loss.
Straightaway everyone will go and make a sukkah on the top of his roof; but the Holy Blessed One will cause the sun to burn over them as at the summer season and every one of them will trample down his sukkah and go away, as it is said,
“Let us break their bands, and cast away their cords from us” (Psalms 2:3).
He caused the sun to burn over them!
But did you not just say,
“The Holy Blessed One does not deal harshly with his creatures?”
True! But with the Israelites, too, it occasionally happens

Daf 3b

that the summer season extends till Sukkot and they are troubled [by the heat].
But didn’t Rava say:
He who is troubled is exempt from dwelling in the Sukkah?
True he is exempt, but should he trample it.
Thereupon the Holy Blessed One will laugh at them, as it is said,
“He that sits in heaven will laugh” (Psalms 2:4).
R. Yitzchak said:
“Only on that day is there laughter before the Holy Blessed One.”
There are those who teach the comment of R. Yitzchak in connection with the following teaching, as it was taught: R. Yosi says:
In the time to come non-Jews will come and convert.
But will they be accepted?
Has it not been taught:
In the days of the Messiah converts will not be accepted; likewise they did not accept converts in the days of David or of Solomon?
Rather, they will be self-made converts, and they will place tefillin on their heads and on their arms, fringes on their garments, and a mezuzah on their doorposts,
but when they see the battle of Gog and Magog, he will ask them,
“For what purpose have you come?” 
And they will reply:
“Against God and His Messiah” as it is said,
“Why are the nations in an uproar, and why do the peoples mutter in vain” (Psalms 2:1). Then each of them will throw aside his mitzvah and go away, as it is said,
“Let us break their bands, and cast away their cords from us” (Psalms 2:3), And the Holy Blessed One will laugh at them, as it  is said,
“He that sits in heaven will laugh” (Psalms 2:4).
R. Yitzchak said:
“Only on that day is there laughter before the Holy Blessed One.
But is this so?
Has Rav Judah not said in the name of Rav:
There are twelve hours in a day; during the first three hours the Holy Blessed One occupies Himself with the Torah, during the second three He sits in judgment of the whole world, and when He sees that the world deserves destruction, He transfers Himself from the seat of Justice to the seat of Mercy;
during the third quarter, He feeds the whole world from the horned ram to the eggs of vermin; during the fourth quarter He is sporting with the leviathan, as it is said,
“There is leviathan, whom You have formed to laugh (or play) with” (Psalms 104: 26)?
R. Nahman b. Yitzchakh said: With His creatures he does laugh, but he does not laugh at His creatures except on that day. 
Aha said to R. Nahman b. Isaac:
Since the day of the destruction of the Temple, there is no laughter for the Holy Blessed One.
How do we know that there is no laughter?
If we say from the verse,
“And on that day the Lord, the God of Hosts, called you to weep and wail” (Isaiah 22:12). Perhaps this refers to that day and no more.
Rather, as it is written:
“If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you?” (Psalms 137:5). Perhaps this rules out forgetting, but does not rule out laughter.
Rather from the verse,
“I have long time held my peace, I have been still, and refrained myself, now will I cry.”
What then does God do in the fourth quarter [of each day]?...
He sits and instructs the school children, as it is said,
“To whom shall one teach knowledge, and to whom shall one make the message understood?
To them that are weaned from the milk, to those just taken from the breast” (Isaiah 28:9).
Who instructed them before that?
If you want, you may say
Metatron.
Or if you want you may say
God did this as well as other things.
And what does He do by night?
If you want you may say,
the kind of thing He does by day.
And if you want you may say
He rides his light cherub, and floats in eighteen thousand worlds; as it is said,
“The chariots of God are myriads, even thousands of thousands (shinan)” (Psalms 68:18) Do not read shinan, [repeated], but she-enan [that are not quite 20,000].
Or if you want you may say,
He sits and listens to the song of the Hayyot, as it is said,
“By the day the Lord will command His lovingkindness and in the night His song shall be with me” (Psalms 42:9).
Levi says:
Anyone who stops [learning] words of the Torah and indulges in idle gossip will be made to eat glowing coals of juniper, as it is said,
“They pluck salt-wort with wormwood; and the roots of juniper are their food” (Job 30:4).
Resh Lakish said:
Anyone who engages in the study of the Torah by night, the Holy One extends a thread of grace  over him by day, as it is said,
“By day the Lord will command his lovingkindness, and in the night his song shall be with me” (Psalms 42:9). Why will the Lord command his lovingkindness by day? Because His song shall be with me in the night.
Some say that Resh Lakish said:
 Anyone who engages in the study of the Torah in this world, which is like night, the Holy Blessed One extends a thread of grace over him in the future world, which is like day, as it is said:
“By day the Lord, etc.”
Rav Judah said in the name of Shmuel: Why is it written,
“And You made man as the fishes of the sea, and as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them” (Habbakuk 1:14)? 
Why are humans compared to the fishes of the sea?
To tell you,
just as the fishes of the sea, as soon as they come on to dry land, die, so also people, as soon as they separate themselves from Torah and the commandments die immediately.
Another explanation:
Just as the fishes of the sea, as soon as the sun scorches them, they die; so too people, when struck by the sun, die.
This can be applied to the present world, or to the future world.
If you want you can say that this applies to this world, in accordance with R. Hanina, for R. Hanina says:
Everything is in Heaven’s hands, except cold and heat, as is said,
“Thorns and snares are in the path of the wicked; He who values his life will keep far from them” (Proverbs 22:5).
And if you want you can say it applies to the world to come, in accordance with R. Shimon b. Lakish, for R. Shimon b. Lakish says:
There is no gehenna in the world to come. Rather, the Holy Blessed One brings the sun out of its sheath, and it beats down [on the world]: the wicked are punished by it, the righteous are healed by it.
The wicked are punished by it,

Daf 4a

as it is said:
“For lo! That day is at hand, burning like an oven. All the arrogant and all the doers of evil shall be straw, and the day that is coming—said the LORD of Hosts—shall burn them to ashes and leave of them neither stock nor boughs” (Malachi 3:19). It shall leave them neither stock — in this world, nor bough — in the world to come.
The righteous are healed by it, as it is said,
“But for you who revere My name a sun of victory shall rise to bring healing” (Malachi 3:20). Moreover, they will delight in it, as it is said,
You shall go forth and stamp like stall-fed calves” (ibid.).
Another explanation:
Just as among fish of the sea, every fish greater than its fellow swallows its fellow, so with men, were it not for fear of the government, every person greater than his fellow would swallow his fellow. And this is what
was taught: R. Hanina, the Deputy High Priest, said,
Pray for the welfare of the government, for were it not for the fear of it, people would swallow each other alive.
R. Hinena b. Papa pointed to the following contradiction: Scripture says,
“Shaddai—we have not found the greatness of his power” (Job 37:23), yet it is written,
“Great is our Lord and of abundant power” (Psalms 147:5) and it is also written, 
“Your right hand, O Lord, is glorious in power!” (Exodus 15:6).
There is no contradiction:
the former refers to the time of judgment, the latter refers to a time of war.
R. Hama b. Hanina pointed to another contradiction: It is written,
“I have no fury,” (Isaiah 27:4), yet it is also written,
“The Lord takes revenge and is furious” (Nahum 1:2).
There is no contradiction:
the former refers to Israel, the latter to non-Jews.
R. Hinena b. Papa said:
“I have no fury” for I already vowed, would that I had not so vowed, then, “If one offers Me thorns and thistles, I will march to battle against him, And set all of them on fire” (Isaiah 27:4).
This accords with the following teaching of R. Alexandri: What is it that is written,
“And it shall come to pass on that day that I will seek to destroy all the nations” (Zechariah 12:9). “Seek” from whom?
The Holy Blessed One said: 
I will seek their records: if they have any meritorious deeds to their credit, I will redeem them, but if not, I will destroy them.
This also accords with what Rava said: What is it that is written,
“Surely He would not strike at a ruin if, in calamity, one cried out to Him” (Job 30:24)?
The Holy Blessed One to Israel: When I judge Israel,
I do not judge them as I do the non-Jews concerning whom it is said, 
“Ruin, an utter ruin, I will make it,” (Ezekiel 21:32). Rather I only exact payment from them [a little at a time] as the hen does her picking.
Another explanation:
Even if Israel does before Me only a few good deeds, like hens picking in a rubbish heap, I will make them accumulate to a large sum, as it is said, 
“Though they pick little they are saved” (Job 30:24).  Another interpretation:
As a reward of their crying before Me, I save them.
This is similar to what R. Abba said: What is it that is written,
“For I was their Redeemer; Yet they have plotted treason against Me?” (Hosea 7:13). 
I thought I would redeem them by depriving them of monetary possessions in this world, so that they would be worthy to merit the world to come, yet they have plotted against me.
And this is similar to what R. Papi said in the name of Rava: What is it that is written,
“I braced, I strengthened their arms, And they plot evil against Me” (Hosea 7:15)? 
The Holy Blessed One says: 
I thought I would chastise them with suffering in this world, so that their arm might be strengthened in the world to come, yet they plot evil against me.
