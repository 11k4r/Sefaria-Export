Daf 3a



Is it not taught: R. Meir used to say. 
‘Whence do we know that even an idolater who studies the Torah is equal to a High Priest? 
From the following verse: 
Ye shall therefore keep My statutes and My ordinances which, if a man do, he shall live by them. It does not say "If a Priest, Levite, or Israelite do, he shall live by them," but "a man"; here, then, you can learn that even a heathen who studies the Torah is equal to a High Priest!’ 
What is meant, then, is that they are rewarded not as greatly as one who does a thing which he is bidden to do, but as one who does a thing unbidden. For, R. Hanina said: 
He who is commanded and does, stands higher then he who is not commanded and does....

R. Yehoshua ben Levi said
Israel made the (golden) calf only to provide an opening for those who seek to return (ba'alei t'shuvah) as it is written:
'Would that it were possible that these feelings would stay with them and they would revere me forever...'

Daf 8a






















The Tannaitic sages taught:
When the first person saw the days shortening, he said:
"Woe to me! Perhaps it is on account of my sin that the world is becoming dark and it is returning to a state of void and chaos! This must be the death penalty that heaven decreed upon me."
He sat for eight days of fasting and prayer.
When he saw, after the solstice of the month of Tevet, that the days were lengthening, he said:
"This must be the way of the world."
He went and celebrated eight days of festival.
The next year, he established eight days of festival for all.
He established them for the sake of heaven, but they [idolators] kept them for idol worship.

And it has further been taught: ...
One should not sell them either weapons or accessories of weapons, nor should one grind any weapon for them, not may one sell them either stocks or neck-chains or ropes, or iron chains — neither to idolaters nor Cutheans.
What is the reason for this (not selling to Cutheans)?
If we say they are suspect of murder, are they really suspect?
Did you not say
one can seclude themselves with them
rather it is since they will sell them to non-Jews.
And if you will say
a Cuthean does not repent wheras a Jew does repent
Rav Nachman said in the name of Rabbah bar Avuha 
"Just as it is forbidden to sell to a non Jew so it is forbidden to sell to a Jew who is suspected of selling to a non Jew"


Rav Dimi bar Abba said:
Just as it is forbidden to sell weapons to a non Jew it is also forbidden to sell to a Jewish robber. 
what is the case?
If he is suspected of murder then it is obvious, it is no different then a non Jew
If he is not suspect of murder, why not?
Rather the case is that he is not suspect of murder and what is the case here? He is a Mashmuta (Artscroll: sneak thief), sometimes he will use to save himself

This disagrees with the opinion of Rabbi Pedas for R' Pedas said

Daf 19a

Abraham, our father, did not walk in the ways of the Dor HaFlaga (Generation of the Dispersal), for they were wicked as it says:
"Let us build for ourselves a city" (Genesis 11:4) 













......
A person only learn Torah in a place that his heart desires










Rava said,
"Truly, a person should study Torah in the area that his heart desires, as it is stated, 
'But in the Torah of God is his desire.'"
And Rava  said, 
"At first it is associated with the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, and finally it is associated with his name, as it is stated 
'In the Torah of God is his desire, and in His (read here as 'his') Torah he will toil day and night.'"
































(Psalms 1:3) "And he shall be like a tree replanted by streams of water." The disciples of R. Yanai said, 
"[It says] 'a tree replanted' and not 'a tree planted' [to teach us that] anyone that only learns Torah from one teacher will never see any blessing."

Daf 19b



Daf 20a

For Scripture says (Deuteronomy 7:2) "nor show mercy unto them" - do not grant them occupation of the land.
But "nor show mercy unto them" is needed for this: The Merciful One is saying,
"Do not grant them favor."
If so, Scripture should have said
"nor show mercy unto them" [spelled with a vav]. What does "nor show mercy unto them" [spelled without a vav] mean?
This implies two things.
But it is still [otherwise] required, for this is what the Merciful One is saying:
"Do not give them free gifts."
If so, Scripture should have said "nor give freely unto them" [spelled with a yod]. What does "nor show mercy unto them" [spelled without a yod] mean?
This implies all of the above.
There is also a <i>beraita</i> accordingly:
"Nor give freely unto them" - do not grant them occupation of the land.
Alternatively,
"nor give freely unto them" - do not grant them favor.
Alternatively,...
"nor give freely unto them" - do not give them free gifts.

Daf 27a

It has been stated: From where do we know that circumcision by a non Jew is invalid? Daru b. Papa said in the name of Rav: You shall keep my covenant (Gen 17:9). R. Yohanan said: Circumcised he hall be circumcised (Gen 17:13) - he who is circumcised shall circumcise.
Rather there is between them - a woman. He who said: You shall keep my covenant - this isn't a possibility, for a woman isn't a bat- mila, and he who said Circumcised he shall be circumcised - this is a possibility, for  a woman, too, is as if she is circumcised. 
And is there anyone who could say that a woman isn't able to? But it says: "So Zipporah took a flint an cut off her son's foreskin" (Ex 4:25)! Read it as:"she caused someone to take". But is says, "and cut off"! Read it as:"she caused someone to cut off". And if you want, you can say, she started it, and Moshe came and finished it.

Daf 44b

Proclos, son of a philosopher, asked a question to R. Gamliel in Acco when the latter was bathing in the bath of Aphrodite. He said to him: It is written in your Torah, you shall make you graven images. Why are you bathing in the bath of Aphrodite? He replied to him, we may not answer [questions relating to Torah] in a bath. When he came out, he said to him, I did not come into her domain, she has come into mine. Nobody says, The bath was made as an adornment for Aphrodite. But he says, Aphrodite was made as an adornment for the bath.
